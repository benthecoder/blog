# Blog

A minimalistic blog made with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Design inspired by [James Quiambao](https://www.jquiambao.com/) and [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io)

Tutorial on how to build this blog can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hiabp1GY8fA).

## Ideas

- Add some GPT functionalities like <https://github.com/jxnl/magic-text>
- input article link, have it summarize for me, and then highlights allow me to search that term and redirect to perplexity.
- in my /write page, highlights allow me to query chatGPT api to rewrite it given a prompt.
