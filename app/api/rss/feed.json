T tried a few and found an H&M black dress that she looked amazing in. then we walked to tjs to buy salmon and other kiwi, and we made miso soup and salmon for dinner. it's nice to spend a day out like this like normal human beings, instead of being cooped up in an office or at home. i would enjoy this life a lot, it doesn't take a lot to be happy.",

You can tell that you’re in the presence of good design if you have thoughts like “huh, this ended up being easier than I expected”, or “I never have to think about this part of the system, it’s fine”.

If your goal is to get somewhere quickly, an e-bike is definitely advantageous compared to a bike with no e-assist. If your goal is to become a better / stronger cyclist, an e-bike isn’t really going to help you with that.\n>\n> [It’s similar] with AI tools / LLMs. They can let you explore more at a faster pace and get you places faster. This can be really helpful for familiarizing yourself with topics or concepts or doing exploratory research. And if your goal is just to produce code, they will definitely speed that up. But if your goal is to engage with the work of programming on a deeper level, which I think is essential to become a better programmer, the more you rely on them the more you rob yourself of the benefits accrued through engaging with the process.\n\n> I doubt very much if it is possible to teach anyone to understand anything, that is to say, to see how various parts of it relate to all the other parts, to have a model of the structure in one’s mind. We can give other people names, and lists, but we cannot give them our mental structures; they must build their own. — John Holt\n",

To know God and to live is one and the same thing. God is life.” ￼\n\n> “Faith is a knowledge of the meaning of human life in consequence of which man does not destroy himself but lives. Faith is the strength of life. If a man lives he believes in something… If he understands the illusory nature of the finite, he must believe in the infinite. Without faith he cannot live.”\n\n> “In general the relation of the experimental sciences to life’s question may be expressed thus: Question: ‘Why do I live?’ Answer: ‘In infinite space, in infinite time, infinitely small particles change their forms in infinite complexity, and when you have understood the laws of those mutations of form you will understand why you live on the earth.’” ￼\n\n> “‘What is the meaning of my life?’ was: ‘You are what you call your “life”; you are a transitory, casual cohesion of particles. The mutual interactions and changes of these particles produce in you what you call your “life”. That cohesion will last some time; afterwards the interaction of these particles will cease and what you call “life” will cease, and so will all your questions. You are an accidentally united little lump of something... The lump will disintegrate and there will be an end of the fermenting and of all the questions.’” ￼\n\n> “So I too clung to the twig of life, knowing that the dragon of death was inevitably awaiting me, ready to tear me to pieces; and I could not understand why I had fallen into such torment. The deception of the joys of life which formerly allayed my terror of the dragon now no longer deceived me.” ￼\n\n> “I look into the immensity of sky and try to forget about the immensity below, and I really do forget it. The immensity below repels and frightens me; the immensity above attracts and strengthens me. ... I see that I no longer hang as if about to fall, but am firmly held. ... From the pillar a loop hung very ingeniously and yet simply, and if one lay with the middle of one’s body in that loop and looked up, there could be no question of falling.” ￼\n",

What metrics or frameworks do you use to assess impact on research workflows?”\n- **EHR realities:**\n  - Database of patient info and clinical actions (procedures).\n  - Also the _workflow_ backbone for care delivery; major investment in Epic.\n- **SMART on FHIR:**\n  - Exposes EHR to external apps; enables innovation outside Epic.\n- **Patient‑generated data (PGD):**\n  - Standardization is hard (OpenHealth attempts to help).\n  - Vendors like Garmin and Oura keep data in proprietary clouds; often undocumented/uncalibrated.\n  - Jupyter Health → CommonHealth ingestion to standardize for model training.\n- **Patient‑facing tooling:**\n  - Columbia × Jupyter Health: reusable tools for patient outreach.\n- **CGM data:**\n  - Many clinicians aren't trained for continuous streams.\n  - Partner with endocrinology on clinical markers & interpretation.\n  - Build a starter library of models/algorithms for these use cases.\n\n## Panel — ethics, evaluation, and systems (moderator: Emily Alsentzer)\n\n- **Themes:** publish‑or‑perish; public image of scientists; corporate control; individualist culture; capitalism sets the script.\n- \"New\" gen‑AI ethics issues are old challenges in new clothes; disproportionate impacts on communities of color.\n- AI should support clinicians; include philosophers in teams; rethink _progress_/_efficiency_; redesign systems, not just models; preserve human agency.\n- Rethink paper structure (beyond IMRaD) to keep human decision‑making visible; requires political will.\n- Build human‑AI systems that are humble, curious, empathetic; fix perverse incentives that remove joy from learning.\n- **AI literacy:** nurses and patients need it; curricula should revamp yearly; emphasize critical thinking.\n- **Benchmarks ≠ evaluation:**\n  - Benchmarks drive procurement/VC, but don't equal real‑world performance.\n  - _Principles for eval frameworks:_\n    1. **Hyperlocal:** hospital‑ and task‑specific; organize real‑world eval where patients define what matters.\n    2. **Agile & reflexive:** adaptable and effective over time.\n    3. **Continuous & community‑operated:** from the ground up, not just NEURIPS/CSAIL.\n  - Always ask: _What is this evaluation for?_ Model selection ≠ clinical deployment.\n- **People:**\n  - [Jenna C.

The generation process is guided by carefully engineered prompts that specify medical domain requirements while ensuring complete de-identification.\n\nGeneration parameters were optimized with temperature=0.5 to balance consistency with variability, and max_tokens=4000 to accommodate complex medical records. Our robust processing pipeline includes comprehensive error handling, multiple fallback strategies for parsing different response structures, and conversion of synthetic records back to standardized DataFrame format.\n\nQuality control measures enforce structural fidelity to the original data while ensuring all synthetic identifiers remain realistic but non-identifiable. We applied this methodology to generate synthetic brain cancer MRI and pathology report pairs, maintaining the original dataset's cancer type distribution.\n\nThis approach enables privacy-compliant data sharing for medical research while preserving clinically relevant patterns and relationships in the data, addressing a critical need in collaborative medical research where protected health information constraints often limit data accessibility.\n```\n\nhow it looks like in code\n\n```python\nsample_data = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\").head(10)\ndata_type = \"mri and pathology\",\nspecific_context = \"Brain cancer MRI and pathology reports of glioblastoma\"\nnum_samples=2\n\nreal_examples = sample_data.sample(min(2, len(sample_data))).to_dict(\"records\")\n\n# System prompt engineering for medical domain requirements\nsystem_prompt = f\"\"\"You are a data synthesis expert specializing in medical {data_type} generation.\nYour task is to generate synthetic data that closely resembles the provided examples\nwhile ensuring complete privacy protection.

    "content": "\nmy responses for the [mlh top 50](https://top.mlh.io/nominations) application\n\n1. What affiliations do you have with clubs, hackathons, organizing teams, etc?\n   - I founded and served as President of Google Developer Student Club at Iowa State University, where I grew the club from 0 to 150 students. I've participated in over 25 hackathons ranging from university events to major competitions like ETHGlobal and Anthropic Builder's Day. I was also selected as the youngest HP Data Science Global Ambassador from 1,400 applicants, creating technical GPU guides for data scientists. My hackathon journey includes everything from local events like ISU Fall 2021 Hackathon to high-profile AI competitions where I've won various prizes totaling over $65,000 in cash and credits. I was also one of the organizers of Chinatown Hacks, the largest hackathon for high school students in the Bay Area in San Francisco sponsored by HP and NVIDIA, bringing in over 50 students from 25 high schools.\n2. How did you start in technology or coding? How did you discover your love for it?\n   - My coding journey began in high school in Malaysia on a buggy Toshiba laptop, where I taught myself by watching YouTube videos, coding simple linear regression models and creating graphics with PyTurtle. I started sharing what I learned about data science and AI on Medium.com, which eventually grew to 42k followers (as of April 2025). In Malaysia, we didn't have a strong hackathon culture - programming was limited to classes and assignments, never about creating real products. It wasn't until I transferred to Iowa State University that I attended my first hackathon, which opened my eyes to the possibilities of turning code into impactful projects. Through these hackathons and side projects, I was able to secure an internship at Tesla, where I met fascinating people in the tech industry and attended numerous events. It showed me how exciting the Bay Area tech ecosystem is, with its unique blend of innovation, opportunity, and collaborative energy that I hadn't found anywhere else.\n3. Can you tell us the story of how you joined the hacker community?\n   - I joined the hacker community in Fall 2021 through a small hackathon organized by the Iowa State CS department, where my team built \"Ekans,\" a reverse snake game that won Most Creative Project and sparked my passion for building with code. From there, I dove headfirst into the hackathon scene, participating in over 25 events ranging from university competitions to major hackathons like ETHGlobal and Anthropic Builder's Day in SF. I've built projects across various domains - from healthcare solutions at Hacklytics to financial tech at HackWashU, and from data visualization tools at HooHacks (winning 2nd place for Best Data Science Hack) to AI applications that earned 3rd place at both DragonHacks and HackPrinceton. What kept me coming back was the collaborative intensity of these events - the shared excitement of building solutions to real problems under time constraints, and the community of like-minded builders who valued creativity and technical excellence. I'm still doing that today, while I'm not in class for my master's in data science, or working on cancer research at UCSF as an ML engineer, I'm attending hackathons and events every week, having fun building interesting solutions with my friends and with the community.\n4. How have technology, hackathons, or the hacker community changed your life?\n   - Hackathons completely transformed my life's trajectory. They were my ticket into the Bay Area and the tech industry, opening doors I never imagined possible for someone from Malaysia. These projects became my portfolio, helping me secure my Tesla internship when I had no Silicon Valley connections. Each hackathon taught me something valuable - from technical skills to the art of pitching under pressure and collaborating effectively with new teammates.\n   - The Bay Area hackathon community expanded my horizons in meaningful ways. At the Anthropic Builder's Day, I found myself casually chatting with YC founders about their startup journeys over late-night snacks. During various hackathons, I connected with engineers from established companies who treated me as a peer rather than just a student. These connections created a supportive network that helped me navigate job searches, technical challenges, and even the complexities of being an international student in tech.\n   - What I value most is how the hacker community embraces diversity of thought and background. At hackathons, I've collaborated with people from various countries and disciplines, each bringing unique perspectives to our projects. The community taught me to embrace the hacker ethos of building, sharing, and problem-solving without judgment. These values have shaped not just how I code, but how I approach challenges in life - with curiosity, resourcefulness, and a belief that problems can be solved systematically through collaboration and creative thinking.\n5. How have you made an impact on the hacker community?\n   - I had the great privilege to organize Chinatown Hacks 2025, the largest hackathon for high school students in the Bay Area with my friends, bringing together over 50 students from 25 high schools and securing $15k in prizes through partnerships with sponsors including HP, NVIDIA, TwelveLabs, Cloudflare, and Vercel. Alongside my friends, we created opportunities for the next generation of hackers to experience the thrill of building and collaborating while celebrating culture, innovation, and community. Miss Chinatown Hannah Chea even joined us, highlighting the cultural significance of our event and creating a welcoming atmosphere for students from diverse backgrounds.\n   - My writing on Medium.com, where I've gained 42k followers and 2 million views, has allowed me to share technical knowledge, hackathon experiences, and project insights with a global audience. Through detailed articles about projects like embedcurius (which visualizes bookmark collections as 3D embeddings) and ClassGPT, I've inspired others to build and launch their own projects.\n6. What about your story do you think makes you stand out in the hacker community?\n   - What makes my story stand out is my persistence despite being an international student and facing numerous obstacles. Coming from Malaysia to the US to pursue tech, I've had to work twice as hard to create opportunities. I turned hackathons into my pathway to success - winning competitions while building a network that eventually led to internships at Tesla and UCSF. Throughout this journey, I've made it a point to mentor other international students, helping them navigate similar challenges.\n   - My journey demonstrates how hackathons can be more than just weekend projects - they can be career-defining opportunities. I've shown how someone from outside the traditional tech pipeline can leverage these events to break into the industry, while giving back to the community through organizing events, sharing knowledge, and fostering an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to build and learn together.\n7. What is your favorite programming language or framework?\n   - Python has been my go-to language for years, especially for data science and machine learning projects. I love its readability and the massive ecosystem of libraries like Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, and Sentence-Transformers that make complex tasks accessible.\n   - For web development, I've grown to appreciate the React and Next.js ecosystem with TypeScript. Building apps with this stack has shown me how powerful these tools can be for creating modern interfaces.\n   - What I value most in any language or framework is how it enables me to build solutions quickly while maintaining quality. I value simplicity; the best tools are those that get out of your way and let you focus on solving the core problem.\n8. What tool or platform could you not live without?\n   - I couldn't live without GitHub and AI code editors like Cursor. GitHub has been essential for all my projects, from hackathons to research work. It's not just version control - it's where I collaborate, share my work, and learn from others.\n   - AI coding assistants have revolutionized how I work. Using tools like Claude and ChatGPT I can turn my ideas into reality within hours, making building fun instead of frustrating.\n9. What's a favorite hobby of yours?\n   - Writing has become one of my most fulfilling hobbies. I maintain a blog where I write about technology, programming, psychology, and personal reflections. Writing helps me organize my thoughts and share knowledge with others. It's a form of thinking in public that forces me to clarify my ideas.\n   - I've also developed a love for photography, especially during my six-month break after graduation. There's something magical about capturing moments and telling stories through images. It exercises a different creative muscle than programming but shares the same attention to detail and composition.\n10. What's a random fun fact about yourself?\n    - I trained professionally for table tennis from age 10 through college. I practiced 3-5 times a week, playing against older players, and repeating the same serves and smashes hundreds of times during my training sessions. I also have a custom racket that my coach made specifically for me.\n11. Tell us a few memorable stories of your time in the community! They can range from a funny moment to a life-changing interaction - we want to hear them all.\n    - When I first started Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at Iowa State, I organized an ML workshop and discovered the universal truth of campus events: pizza guarantees attendance. I was genuinely worried no one would show up, but the room filled with hungry, curious students. This small success gave me confidence to organize larger tech events and build collaborations with other clubs across campus.\n    - As a GDSC lead, I attended a North American leadership conference at Google's campus. Walking through those hallways, riding the famous Google bikes, and meeting other student leaders from across the continent was surreal. I remember standing there thinking, \"Maybe I'll work here someday,\" feeling both inspired and slightly intimidated by the possibility.\n    - During 2021, most hackathons were virtual, which led to an unexpected advantage. My best friend in Malaysia and I developed a unique strategy - I would work on projects with US teammates until I couldn't stay awake, then he would pick up where I left off due to the time difference. We became the perfect team - me handling front-end and AI, him taking care of the backend. Today we're both living in the same apartment in Chinatown SF, still going to hackathons.\n    - My first tech conference was Airflow Summit in Toronto, which I attended on scholarship. It was my first time ever in Canada, and I felt lost and completely out of place until I met another attendee from Singapore. That small connection to home made all the difference, and suddenly I felt comfortable exploring and networking with industry professionals.\n    - Anthropic Builder's Day stands out as my most unexpected hackathon success. Walking in, we were intimidated by the 50 teams filled with big tech engineers, YC founders, and PhD students. We initially planned to just enjoy the free food and networking, but ended up building a CAPTCHA system to detect AI agents in just two hours. When we won second place, I was completely shocked - it taught me never to underestimate what you can build in a short time with the right idea.\n    - Organizing Chinatown Hacks came full circle for me. After experiencing rejection from selective hackathons myself, I wanted to create an accessible event for high school students. My friends and I spent three months securing sponsors (HP and NVIDIA through my ambassador connections), reaching out to every high school in San Francisco, and arranging prizes like full passes to NVIDIA GTC. Though the planning was exhausting and recruitment harder than expected, watching students arrive on event day and build their projects made every challenge worthwhile. Creating opportunities for the next generation of hackers felt like giving back to the community that had changed my life.\n",

    "content": "\nsketching out logistic regression for my interview, because i need to get the fundamentals down.\n\nthe problem is we want to predict binary outcomes (0,1), but we can't do that with linear regression that predicts continuous.\n\nhow do we get a model that outputs probabilities between 0 and 1? and how can we make a decision boundary to produce binary outcomes?\n\nthe answer is a sigmoid function.\n\n$p(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ where $z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n$\n\nthis bounds the output between 0 and 1, and we can create a decision boundary at $p(x) = 0.5$ which is where $z = 0$\n\nbut what are we modeling here? the probabilities?\n\nthe key insight is that logistic regression doesn't directly model probabilities in a linear way - it models the log-odds.\n\nWhy log-odds? Because:\n\n1. probability constraints: probability must be between 0 and 1, which isn't compatible with linear modeling (that produces unbounded values)\n\n2. log-odds transformation: when we take $\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$, we transform the bounded 0-1 range into an unbounded range ($-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$)\n\n3. linear relationship: This allows us to model log-odds as a linear function of features:\n\n   $\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_nX_n$\n\nThe magic happens in this transformation. Consider:\n\n- If $p = 0.5$, log-odds $= 0$\n- If $p > 0.5$, log-odds $> 0$\n- If $p < 0.5$, log-odds $< 0$\n- As $p$ approaches $1$, log-odds approaches $+\\infty$\n- As $p$ approaches $0$, log-odds approaches $-\\infty$\n\nSo we're essentially saying:\n\n1. we want to model probability $p$\n2. but we can't directly use linear regression on $p$ (bounded)\n3. so we transform $p$ to log-odds (unbounded)\n4. model log-odds linearly\n5. transform back to probability using sigmoid\n\nthis is why the coefficients in logistic regression represent changes in log-odds, and we can exponentiate them ($e^{\\beta}$) to get odds ratios.\n\nbut how do we estimate our coefficients ($\\beta_0 \\to \\beta_n$) that maximizes the probability of observing our training data?\n\nwe need a way to estimate the best coefficients ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n$) that maximize the probability of observing our training data.\n\nto do that, we need MLE.\n\nwe use MLE to find the coefficients that make our observed data most likely:\n\nfirst we want to likelihood function, to calculate it, we calculate the probability of its actual outcome for each data point\n\nfor a binary classification, the likelihood is\n\n$L(\\beta) = \\prod p(x)^y \\cdot (1-p(x))^{(1-y)}$\n\nWhere $y$ is the true label (0 or 1)\n\nto make optimization easier, we take the log so it converts the multiplication into an addition, known as the log likelihood\n\n$$\\log(L(\\beta)) = \\sum [y \\cdot \\log(p(x)) + (1-y) \\cdot \\log(1-p(x))]$$\n\nand unlike linear regression's closed-form solution, logistic regression uses iterative methods like gradient descent.\n\nthe goal is to find $\\beta$ values that maximize this log-likelihood, essentially finding the most probable model given the data.\n\n---\n\nmore resources\n\n- visualization by [MLU explain](https://mlu-explain.github.io/logistic-regression/)\n- [Concise Implementation of Softmax Regression — Dive into Deep Learning 1.0.3 documentation](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-classification/softmax-regression-concise.html)\n",

Candidate generation (retrieval): simple and fast methods (embedding, simple collaborative) to select 100-1000 from millions or billions (focus on recall (not missing good candidates) and speed)\n2. Ranking (first-pass): moderately complex models to score (logistic regression, GBDT) to select 50-100. (focus on precision and speed)\n3. Reranking (fine-ranking): most powerful model (DCN) the focus is on precision\n\nsome metrics important in recysys\n\nprecision: TP / (TP+FP) : out of all predicted positive, how many were actually positive (how many of our recommendations were actually relevant?)\nrecall: TP / (TP + FN) : out of all actual positive, hoa many did we identify as positive? (of all truly relevant shows, how many did we recommend?)\n\nfalse positives? focus on precision (be as precise about your positives predictions as you can)\nfalse negatives? focus on recall (catch as many positives as possible)\n\nin recsys, we often focus on the top recommendations, since users typically only look at the first few suggestions\n\n- precision@k: look at top k recs, how many are actually relevant?\n  - if 6 are relevant out of top 10, precision@10 = 0.6\n- recall@k: out of all relevant items, how many of your recommendations are in top k\n  - 20 relevant movies, 6 of your movies are in top 10, your recall @10 = 6/20 = 0.3\n\nso precision is about how accurate your top k recommendations are, and recall is how much coverage your recommendations have\n\n---\n\nlinkedin papers\n\n- [Talent Search and Recommendation Systems at LinkedIn: Practical Challenges and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06481)\n- [DCN V2: Improved Deep & Cross Network and Practical Lessons for Web-scale Learning to Rank Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13535)\n- [LiRank: Industrial Large Scale Ranking models at LinkedIn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06859)\n\nrelated\n\n- [Candidate Generation in a Large Scale Graph Recommendation System: People You May Know](https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/recommendations/candidate-generation-in-a-large-scale-graph-recommendation-system-people-you-may-know)\n-\n",

    "content": "\ntook the time to learn the framework for dp. below are some notes from the leetcode explore for DP.\n\ncharacteristics of dp:\n\n- break down into **overlapping** subproblems\n- an optimal solution can be formed\n\nwhat dp is not:\n\n- **greedy** problems have optimal substructure, but not overlapping subproblems\n- **divide and conquer** breaks a problem into subprobelms, but they are not overlapping\n\nwhy it helps?\n\n- it improves time complexity compared to brute force\n- ex: fib(n) has exponential time complexity for brute force, while linear with DP, as it reuses results of subproblems raather than recalculating results for previously seen subproblems\n\ntop-down vs bottom up\n\ntop down (tabulation)\n\n- **iteration** and starts with a basecase\n- order matters\n- usually faster, no recursion overhead\n  ```py\n  # fibonacci\n  F = [0] * (n+1)\n  F[0] = 1\n  F[1] = 1\n  for i in range(2, n):\n      F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2]\n  ```\n\nbottom-up (memoization)\n\n- **recursion** and made efficient with memoization\n- easier to write, order does not matter\n- slower\n\n  ```py\n  memo = {}\n  def f(i):\n      if i < 2:\n          return i\n\n      if i not in memo:\n          memo[i] = f(i-1) + f(i-2)\n\n      return memo[i]\n  ```\n\nwhen to use it?\n\n1. problem asks for optimum value (max/min) of something\n   - min cost of doing ... , how many ways are there to ... , longest possible ...\n   - not enough by itself, could be greedy\n2. future \"decisions\" depends on earlier decisions\n   - ex: house robber\n     - nums = [2,7,9,3,1]\n     - greedy solution is to rob 7, but you miss out on 9 (your early decision affects future decisions)\n   - ex: longest increasing subsequence\n     - nums = [1,2,6,3,5]\n     - important decision is choosing 6 or not, this affects the future (whether you can take 3 and 5)\n\nframework\n\n1. a function that computes answer to problem for every given state\n   - ex: climbing stairs, we have dp(i) which returns number of ways to climb ith step.\n2. a recurrence relation to transition between states\n   - to climb the 10th stair, we need to climb from the 8th or 9th\n   - so # ways to climb 10th stair is # ways to climb 8th + # ways to climb 9th stair\n     - dp(i) = dp(i-1) + dp(i-2)\n   - finding this is the most difficult part\n3. base cases (to prevent it going infinitely)\n   - ask yourself: what state can you find answer without using DP?\n   - there is one way to climb first stair, and two ways to climb two stairs,\n   - base case = dp(1) = 1 and dp(2) = 2\n\nrecurrence -> O(2^n)\n\n```py\ndef climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\n    def dp(i):\n        \"\"\"A function that returns the answer to the problem for a given state.\"\"\"\n        # Base cases: when i is  3 there are i ways to reach the ith stair.\n        if i <= 2:\n            return i\n\n        # If i is not a base case, then use the recurrence relation.\n        return dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)\n\n    return dp(n)\n```\n\nadd memoization -> O(n)\n\n```py\ndef climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\n    def dp(i):\n        if i <= 2:\n            return i\n        if i not in memo:\n            # Instead of just returning dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2), calculate it once and then\n            # store the result inside a hashmap to refer to in the future.\n            memo[i] = dp(i - 1) + dp(i - 2)\n\n        return memo[i]\n\n    memo = {}\n    return dp(n)\n```\n\nbottom up approach\n\n```py\ndef climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    # An array that represents the answer to the problem for a given state\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # base case\n    dp[1] = 1\n    dp[2] = 2\n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] # Recurrence relation\n\n    return dp[n]\n```\n",

We are building something that is adding so much value in the world and if we can stay focused and execute on that vision, we will build a long standing company that changes the world.

    "content": "\ni got an email by contrary saying they could interview me. i was ecstatic. i haven't an interview-type call in a while. i spent the morning dealing with hackathon details, and went capital one at 3 something to grind. i prepped for two questions: background in writing, and why join this fellowship.\n\nbelow is the summary from the call.\n\n### 3 sprint cycles\n\n- 1st is on a new company\n- 2nd is a current company and the work is to improve it\n- 3rd: market map, niche that has not been covered before\n- for each sprint\n  - outline at 2-week mark, comments and edits\n  - submit draft at the end of sprint, 5-10 minute preliminary reading\n  - a month or two, full-read through, 4-8 hours editing and rewriting\n- biggest mistake\n  - not spending enough time on the guidelines, it enforces a discipline on how the writing should be, enforces the way you think, that makes you end up as a researcher and writer\n- on reaching out to companies:\n  - enforce the same standards of communication to all the companies\n\n### my intro i prepared\n\n- born and raised in KL, went to Iowa State for undergrad, got the opportunity to intern with Tesla, fell in love with the bay, came back SF to do my masters in data science, now i’m doing cancer research with AI at UCSF\n\n### my background in writing\n\nstarted in freshman college writing on medium about data science and AI, tutorials, explainers, newsletters and tweets for a startup, writing for HP and nvidia. most recently i’m writing a paper for my research with UCSF. i’m also writing everyday on my own personal blog to develop a muscle of creating rather than just consuming. i have this practice of collecting 10 interesting links i come across every week and post them on Sundays.\n\n### why interested in being a fellow?\n\n- **better writer**:\n  - clear writing = clear thinking\n    - it is hard to write well, because it requires you to think, and there’s a quote that goes like\n    - “If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking”\n  - to have clear writing, you need a **feedback loop**: [rohan](https://rohangupta2036.substack.com/p/rainbows-unicorns-and-spaghetti)’s experience as a fellow: shared how the feedback for his first draft, was as many worse as his essay\n  - i love that, i’m someone who is not afraid of feedback, i remember for my research paper, after receiving the revisions and comments from my professor, and i was admiring the amount of clarity in her writing. that’s what is trive for. PG. says there will be good writers and people who can’t write, and there’s no in between. i want to be the former.\n- **build a startup**:\n  - **business**: i’ve always had an itch to build something, i’ve won a few hackathons with my cofounder, we’ve done prototypes but we’re lacking business skills, researching about companies, reading about the founder stories can fill in the gaps of my knowledge of what it took to go from zero to one.\n  - **techincal**: researching about sesame ai because we have interested in voice agents, help me learn more about the current limitations, competition, and risks, and the market we can capture.\n- **connections:**\n  - maximize my surface area of luck, key to success in building anything is to just keep doing what you love + surround yourself with the right people\n  - i only found out about this fellowship when i reached out to Maxx Yung who wrote about Cerebras, encouraged me to apply to write as well\n\n> \"Write something worth reading or do something worth writing.” on [Kyle](https://kwharrison13.com/essays)'s website\n\neven though i was well-prepared and i was overall just curious and glad to be chatting with them, my hands were shaking and i was holding my breath the entire time. i need to have more coffee chats and apply to more things. there's no downside to rejection, only upsides. i'm in sf, the best place to be for someone like me, and i have to utilize that better.\n\nan hour after i taught v0 for chinatown hacks. i need to get better a teaching. what i do not understand, i cannot teach. what i cannot teach, i do not understand.\n",

My chinese name is 梁耀恩.\n\n## Personal Background\n\n### 1. Where was I born and raised? What's my cultural background?\n\ni was born and raised in kuala lumpur, malaysia. my background is malaysian chinese, my grandparents were the first generation to come to malaysia from china.\n\n### 2. What's my educational journey and current professional path?\n\ni went to a chinese primary school, then an international high school. this converted me to an english speaker, as my mandarin language abilities slowly deteriorated. i went to a local college in malaysia for a program called american degree transfer program, which means i was set on going to the states to study. i took all the gen-ed classes for a year and a half, before covid hit in 2020. then in 2021 i went to iowa state to pursue a bachelors in statistics (initially CS but decided i wanted a challenge). then after two internships with tesla which was life changing, i was lucky enough to do a masters in SF now for a masters in data science. i'm currently working at UCSF health doing ai research for cancer, and i've learned so much about research and what it takes to write a paper abstract. my current path would be something along the lines of MLE/data scientist/research scientist, although i dream about just dropping a conventional career and pursue founding a startup. but my visa constraints and my desire for a cushy faang job is a dillema.\n\n## Values & Passions\n\n### 3. What are my core values and how do they influence my daily decisions?\n\nmy core values are:\n\n- faith in christianity: it shapes my moral system, beliefs, actions, and thinking. reading the bible proves wisdom that nothing else in this world can match.\n- curiosity: what keeps me alive, what drives me to learn and inspires me to want to knonw more\n- suffering: as a key to build resilience, and a necessary component of contentment and gratitude\n- writing: i need to be capturing my thoughts, it's a way to remember who i was before, so i know whether i'm growing, and for me to understand myself better: my wants, dreams and goals, and whether i'm actively working towards achieving it\n- efficient: i try to be as fast as i can. speed is important. constantly iterate. ideas are cheap and they fade away fast. act now.\n- commitment: i don't believe in half-heartedness. commit to the top 5 most important things in your life. it could be people, your side project, your daily writing habit on your personal blog. drop everything else. life is too short to waste it on things that do not matter.\n- risk: take more risks, apply to things you don't believe you have credibility for, be bold and courageous while you're young. get rejected more.\n\n### 4. What am I deeply passionate about in life?\n\ni'm passionate about writing. i believe everyone should have their own little blog on the internet. personal and raw writing with little to no edits; where it comes straight from the heart, like you're dumping on a close friend. they should write about how they spent the entire day just researching about the best tofu recipe and cooking it for themselves, or how they weren't as productive as they wanted to be, or how much they love spending time with their loved ones. these little moments are worth capturing, they make up our entire lives, and they form who we are as an individual.\n\n### 5. What experiences have shaped me most significantly?\n\ni was diagnosed with gerd in 2021, which turned my entire life upside down. after battling with it using 5 different medications, i finally got surgery last year, which improved my life by 80%. i'm not fully cured, but i feel blessed to have a family that can support me, because i know how much worse it could be. this experience made me realize suffering is not a curse, but a blessing, and how it can shape my character and remind me that nothing in life is guaranteed, and i should savor every waking moment where my life is boring and peaceful, because those moments do not last.\n\n## Interests & Lifestyle\n\n### 6. What books, authors, or ideas have most influenced my thinking?\n\nman's search for meaning shaped my way of thinking about suffering, and i'l always remember how he described how we should thinking about meaning. we should not be going around our lives, asking the big question of \"what is the meaning of my life?\" but rather, we ask \"what does the world seek of me.\" we should be asking what our duty and responsibility are in the current moment, and utilize the gifts and opportunities that we have been given, and do it to the best of our abilities. we should stop seeking answers, because the answers will come to us if we follow our guts, and do what we love doing.\n\n### 7. What are my favorite musical artists, films, or other media?\n\ni love k-indie and christian worship music. wave to earth is my go to answer for k-indie, and for christian songs, it's bethel, housefires, mosaic, hillsong, and upperroom. i love ghibli films, if i ever get stuck in a movie, i want it to be a ghibli movie. my favorite one is the wind rises.\n\n### 8. What are my main hobbies and how do I spend my free time?\n\nmy main hobby right now is writing this blog, and building fun little apps. i also try to read non-fiction books on spirituality like mere christianity and the wisdom of insecurities, and non-fiction like dostoevsky and virginia woolf\n\n### 9. What's my ideal way to spend a perfect day?\n\na perfect day is starting the day with reading and writing, eating my nut butter with whole wheat bread and soy drink for breakfast, remembering to pray before every meal, working at a cafe writing/coding (on weekends), and working at a company doing what i love and having interesting conversations with coworkers (weekdays), visiting the bookstore for new finds, taking photos throughout the day, catching the sunset, play some piano, eating something healthy like miso and kimchi, talking to my family, wind down by reading the bible, talking to T before sleeping.\n\n### 10. Am I more introverted or extroverted? How do I recharge?\n\ni'm more introverted. i recharge by staying at home doing skincare and reading books on my ever-growing to-read list, listening to ghibli music, writing about my day on this blog, cleaning the house, sketching ghibli scenes, watching youtube, or just napping.\n\n## Travel & Tastes\n\n### 11. What places have I traveled to that left the biggest impression on me?\n\nthe place that left the biggest impression on me was coming to the bay area when i was 21. i was lucky enough to be an intern with Tesla and the energy of SF was addictive. it was the hackathons, the friends, the weather, the tech companies, the interesting conversations, the bookstores, the sea, the hills. it was so strong that it made me come back here for my masters, i couldn't see a version of life where i was not living here and doing what i love doing. so much so where i was depressed when i had to go back home to malaysia for health reasons. now that i'm back, i always try to remind myself that i'm here because i have a loving father who can support me, and God who's provided for me.\n\n### 12. Where would I most like to visit or live someday?\n\ni really want to visit paris again, and walk around monet's garden, and spend an entire day at the lourve. i also want to go new york again, there's so much happening there. i would also want to live in countryside japan just to experience living in a ghibli movie.\n\n### 13. What's my favorite cuisine and special dishes I enjoy?\n\nI like eating asian food. i like bitter melon, tofu, kimchi, miso, japanese curry, bibimbap, pho, and malaysian food like wanton mee, hainan chicken rice, nasi lemak.\n\n## Personal Growth\n\n### 14. What are my biggest strengths and areas I'm working to improve?\n\nmy biggest strenghts are that i'm curious and i'm never afraid to say yes. i'm always trying to improve, to increase my level of taste, to raise the bar of what i'm capable of achieving. i'm working on becoming more confident and secure in myself. i have insecurities that stem from health issues. i'm learning how to be more well-spoken, to ask better questions, and to not be afraid of being my true self in front of others.\n\n### 15. What accomplishments am I most proud of?\n\nmost recently, i'm proud of getting into a relationship with T. it's something i wasn't actively seeking or wanting, but it felt so natural and generative for the both of us. we each bring out the best in ourselves, and we both have the growth mindset to keep pushing ourselves to be better. it takes a lot of courage and vulnerability to share how you feel to someone, and i'm glad i wasn't afraid to take that leap.\n\n### 16. What challenges have I overcome, and what did I learn from them?\n\ni've overcome gerd, which took me on a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\n### 17. What are my short-term and long-term goals?\n\nshort-term: get a job, get into faang\n\nlong-term: found a startup, get O1, settle in with T\n\n### 18. What makes me laugh or brings me genuine joy?\n\nseeing my friends and family happy, T, ghibli movies\n\n### 19. How would my closest friends describe me?\n\nmy closest friends would describe me as resourceful and curious.\n\n### 20. How do I handle stress or difficult situations?\n\ni don't handle it very well. i pray, talk to T and family, go out for a walk, workout, nap.\n\n### 21. How do I define success for myself?\n\nsuccess = doing what i love surrounded by the people i love\n\n### 22. What am I currently excited about or looking forward to?\n\ni'm excited about graduating and working at a cool company with cool people. i'm looking forward to continue meeting more people, do more fun stuff, experience more things, and start building a life here in the US, hopefully with T close by.\n",

Correctly deciding what to do and figuring out how to navigate an ever-changing world will have huge value; resilience and adaptability will be helpful skills to cultivate\"\n   - \"one of our reasons for launching products early and often is to give society and the technology time to co-evolve\"\n   - \"everyone should have access to unlimited genius to direct however they can imagine. There is a great deal of talent right now without the resources to fully express itself, and if we change that, the resulting creative output of the world will lead to tremendous benefits for us all\"\n6.

[openness elaine](https://elainewrites.substack.com/p/openness)\n   - \"a romantic relationship can be a container to work through your trauma, but that can only happen through conflict\"\n   - Love is more like a basketball than a crystal vase: \"A vase looks beautiful and perfect on the outside but breaks when dropped. When you drop a basketball, it bounces back. If you view conflict as a destructive force, you’ll try to avoid it at all costs. But that’s just deferring the problem until it erupts later, with catastrophic consequences, reaffirming your belief that conflict is destructive. When handled well, conflict makes a relationship more resilient\" – Thomas Hooven on [Modern love](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/fashion/Modern-Love-Nursing-a-Wound-in-an-Appropriate-Place-.html)\n   - in any relationship, the goal is not to convince someone their perspective is wrong. all you can do is express what's important to you and hold space for the other person's truth\n   - \"There is a secret about human love that is commonly overlooked: Receiving it is much more scary and threatening than giving it. [...] Openness is our capacity to let be, to allow, to let in and receive others as they are, in a gentle, spacious way, without having to dominate them or bend them to our will. This kind of letting be is the greatest kindness we can offer those we love.\" – John Welwood, Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships\n9.

The main challenge is individual neurons in an LLM respond to multiple unrelated concepts at once, i.e. a single neuron might process chinese text and pottery shapes, making it hard to understand what the neuron is actually \"doing\". with SAEs, they can decompose these mixed signals into clearer, more interpretabiliy features. so the goal here is less about compression but using sparsity to identify specific, monosemantic features of how a model processes information.\n\n- [Interpretability with Sparse Autoencoders (Colab exercises)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LnHowHgmrMbWtpkxx/interpretability-with-sparse-autoencoders-colab-exercises)\n- [Towards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features#setup-autoencoder)\n- [Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html)\n\n[Variational autoencoder](https://jaan.io/what-is-variational-autoencoder-vae-tutorial/) (VAE) achieves compression by learning a probability distribution in the latent space. a KL divergence term is added to the loss function to regularize the latent distribution. the representation is stochastic. the goal is to learn a continuous, meaningful latent space for generation. they can be used for gen ai (text, image, music generation), representation learning (text2image), anomaly detection, drug discovery, climate modeling, and any situation where you want to learn structured latent spaces that capture meaningful variation, and generate new samples with controlled properties.\n\n- [Variational Autoencoder - Model, ELBO, loss function and maths explained easily!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwEzwTTalbg)\n- [Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders](https://github.com/cdoersch/vae_tutorial)\n- [Variational Autoencoders are Beautiful](https://www.compthree.com/blog/autoencoder/)\n- [Modern PyTorch Techniques for VAEs: A Comprehensive Tutorial](https://hunterheidenreich.com/posts/modern-variational-autoencoder-in-pytorch/)\n\nmy classes are too short to go deep into any concept. teaching recommender systems in just two classes (2 hours each), you only scratch the surface. it's like my europe tour with my family where we travelled 5 countries in 11 days, you spend most of your time on buses, going from one famous landmark to the other.\n\nhomeworks are taking up so much time it's frustrating. i need to approach them with more curiosity. or they just seem like grunt work to me.\n",

Harper and Edward Seidensticker.\n\na vagrant style ranging from toilets to lacquerware, to blackening teeth and persimmon leaf sushi, this book was a fun little portal into mr Tanizaki's philosophy on architecture, drama, food, feminine beauty, and many other aspects of Japanese sense of beauty.\n\nit made me appreciate the tranquil world of darkness and shadows, that allows japanese culture like kabuki theater, shadow play, moon-viewing, and tea ceremony to thrive.\n\ni love the contrast between the softer, quieter, shadowy aesthetics in the old temples and houses and the brighter, more garish Western packed with blinding and scorching electric lights. and in daily objects:\n\n- the writing brush vs fountain pen\n- chinese and japanese paper (warm and calm, envelops light and is quiet and pliant as the leaf of a tree) vs western paper (turns away from the light)\n- tin with patina and lacquerware (beauty in darkness) vs polished silver and steel\n- impure and cloudy jade (a sheen of antiquity) vs bright chilean crystals, glittering diamond, ruby, and emerald\n\nhow instead of sparkling white walls, uniforms, and equipments in hospitals, patients could lie on tatami mats surrounded by sand-colored walls of a Japanese room. his love for darkness in Noh compared to Kabuki, and towards the end, he talks about the the conveniences of modern culture growing increasingly inconsiderate of old people, the beauty of the suburbs being turned over to the masses, denuded of trees, and western aesthetic ideals have become the new standard, as light is being valued over darkness. he wishes, at least, for literature, that the world of shadows to return, have the eaves deep and the walls dark, push back things into the shadows, strip away the useless decorations, for mansions to turn off their electric lights.\n\nfor a visual companion, this [documentary](https://youtu.be/C42INHwTfDM?si=rLd8sq14tRdjgyU8&t=2231) by NHK world contains scenes where they demonstrate how the mournful beauty of lacquerware and a gold screen comes to life in darkness, with only soft candlelights dancing across them.\n\nI have to get my hands on the [vintage classics version](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/355259/in-praise-of-shadows-by-junichiro-tanizaki/9781784875572) with full illustrations one day.\n\nending this with a few quotes i liked\n\non sun and architecture\n\n> “The sun never knew how wonderful it was,” the architect Louis Kahn said, “until it fell on the wall of a building,”\n\nif the japanese invented everything\n\n> But it is on occasions like this that I always think how different everything would be if we in the Orient had developed our own science. Suppose for instance that we had developed our own physics and chemistry: would not the techniques and industries based on them have taken a different form, would not our myriads of everyday gadgets, our medicines, the products of our industrial art - would they not have suited our national temper better than they do?\n\nand being content\n\n> We Orientals tend to seek our satisfactions in whatever surroundings we happen to find ourselves, to content ourselves with things as they are; and so darkness causes us no discontent, we resign ourselves to it as inevitable. If light is scarce, then light is scarce; we will immerse ourselves in the darkness and there discover its own particular beauty. But the progressive Westerner is determined always to better his lot. From candle to oil lamp, oil lamp to gaslight, gaslight to electric light—his quest for a brighter light never ceases, he spares no pains to eradicate even the minutest shadow\n\n---\n\n- [the marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/05/28/in-praise-of-shadows-tanizaki/)\n- [rikumo](https://journal.rikumo.com/journal/2018/5/24/rikumo-book-club-junichiro-anizakis-in-praise-of-shadows)\n- [the atlantic, january 1995](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1955/01/in-praise-of-shadows-a-prose-elegy/641477/)\n",

I’ve complained about how much work it demands, but I also want to say that it has been great fun. I don’t understand why more people aren’t writing them. **It’s not just about sharing your thoughts and recommendations with the rest of the world. Having this vessel that you’re motivated to fill encourages being more observant and analytical in daily life too**\n\nthis task that i set for myself everyday, to just write something everyday is a powerful nudge to do more interesting things, a catalyst for action.\n\nand a few reminders for achieving my goals for 2025 by Dr. Ana\n\n- break down goals into sub-goals\n- keep the goal in mind every day\n- anticipate obstacles with \"if... then\"\n- make it a group effort\n- make it easy to take action\n\na few big goals that i hope to achieve\n\n- graduate and get a full-time job in SF (doing what i love & >$100k)\n- read all the books in by [library](/library) (30 min before bed daily)\n- complete my ghibli scenes sketchbook (sketch on sundays)\n- make a photobook of SF (take more photos)\n- write a book about my parents (in our weekly calls)\n- launch an iOS app (saturday hacks?)\n- complete crosstown trail (w friends)\n- host a hackathon in sf (w friends)\n- get into YC (w wei)\n- get 10k followers on twitter (post whenever i find something interesting without hesitation)\n- 5 links a week newsletter (on my blog and on substack – [inspiration from celine](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/in-praise-of-writing-on-the-internet))\n\nthat's all i can think of for now, signing off.

Shakespeare said \"Journeys end in lovers meeting.\" What an extraordinary thought. Personally, I have not experienced anything remotely close to that, but I am more than willing to believe Shakespeare had. I suppose I think about love more than anyone really should. I am constantly amazed by its sheer power to alter and define our lives. It was Shakespeare who also said \"love is blind\". Now that is something I know to be true. For some quite inexplicably, love fades; for others love is simply lost. But then of course love can also be found, even if just for the night. And then, there's another kind of love: the cruelest kind. The one that almost kills its victims. Its called unrequited love. Of that I am an expert. Most love stories are about people who fall in love with each other. But what about the rest of us? What about our stories, those of us who fall in love alone? We are the victims of the one sided affair. We are the cursed of the loved ones. We are the unloved ones, the walking wounded.

W took me on an uber to the chinese hospital, it's rather fitting since i am chinese. interestingly, this is also the hospital where bruce lee was born, 84 years ago.\n\nonly the ER is open today, first guy i see inside is a homeless man sitting on one of the chairs. there's an unpleasant smell. after registration, and some slight fears about my insurance not being applicable, i wore the hospital wristbands, probably my 3rd one this year. and my 5th hospital visit.\n\nafter waiting a while, i got called into the ER room. i had to take off my pants. i was a little embarrassed. i also wore their gown. after answering some basic questions that the nurse shot at me, the american doctor came and doing some quick checks. after a few different leg exercises and pain checks, he concluded that it was just a pelvic ligament stretch. i felt relieved, but it did not feel like i was completely off the hook.\n\ni ate 7.5 mg meloxicam and 2 pills of 20mg omeprazole to protect my stomach before i was allowed to go home. the wait at the pharmacy was the longest, i happened to find out later that the medicine would've cost >100 dollars, but i ended up only paying $11. wild.\n\ni had salmon and kimchi, my usual meal lately, and my stomach hurt the rest of the night. something about that painkiller caused my heartburn and pain to return and haunt me again. i felt worried about how in order to be free of pain, i had to sacrifice my stomach. it got better towards bedtime.\n\nit reminded me of how much i take daily activities for granted. that health is not guaranteed, and basic tasks like wearing socks and pants, can be difficult, or impossible, and i'm blessed in many ways, more than i know.\n",

We recall the past; we anticipate the future as if we found it too slow in coming and were trying to hurry it up, or we recall the past as if to stay its too rapid flight. We are so unwise that we wander about in times that do not belong to us, and do not think of the only one that does; so vain that we dream of times that are not and blindly flee the only one that is. The fact is that the present usually hurts. We thrust it out of sight because it distresses us, and if we find it enjoyable, we are sorry to see it slip away. We try to give it the support of the future, and think how we are going to arrange things over which we have no control for a time we can never be sure of reaching.\n>\n> Let each of us examine his thoughts; he will find them wholly concerned with the past or the future. We almost never think of the present, and if we do think of it, it is only to see what light it throws on our plans for the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means, the future alone our end.

I could call and text my family if i miss them, i could talk to friends and ask them about their day, i could go out and make new friends if i feel lonely, i could face my problems and worries directly, and actively solve them, instead of letting it consume me slowly. i've been finding myself lacking connection, when i could just put more effort into joining conversations with friends, even if it's about a topic i find uninteresting, i should just say whatever pops into my head. my tiredness can be fixed by prioritizing sleep and diet. there are solutions to everything. even if they are not clear, and not obvious, there are steps you can take. as long as you keep taking action and moving forward in a positive direction.\n\ni'm turning 23 in a week, and it scares me. it scares me how fast time passes. how uncertain the future can feel at times. how it feels like i'm still stuck in the past, unwilling to let go and move on. it scares me that i'm in SF, a vibrant and beautiful city full of possibilities, and i'm feeling empty and depressed, lacking purpose and connection. that i have so much room to grow, in my faith as a christian, in my communication skills, in staying connected with my family and friends, in dealing with my insecurities, in my technical skills. how do i know i'm living my life right? what is right? how do i know i'm making the right decisions in life? how do i make the fullest of my time and experience being in SF in my early 20s? what mistakes am I making that I'm not even aware of? how do i minimize regret?\n\ni have to turn emotions into action. take more risks. run more experiments. do more things that excites me. stay curious.\n",

I should've played to my strengths, and focused on building a nice UI, instead of waiting to integrate with another part of the project. i had no confidence in my abilities for this project, and that impacted my contribution.\n\nhad conversations about career, relationships, friendships, parents, agency, impact on the world, malaysia, increasing surface area of luck, and also about the future of the project.\n\ngot so much swag from the hackathon, spent 30 minutes pasting stickers on my luggage while watching [leah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adm6qv468j8).\n\nrealized i've forgot most of the biblical stories and i find it hard to devote time to study the bible and grow in my faith. the goal is to read mere christianity before bed everyday, and take some [classes](https://bibleproject.com/classroom/) from the bible project every sunday.\n",

Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don't understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don't understand.\n- For the **next 3 minutes**: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right now.\n- In the **final 2 minutes**: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every name they give you.\n  Repeat the above process for every name you're given. Don't stop until there are no new names.\n\nthe first 25 mins gives you a framework to integrate new information more quickly. it will index on areas that are under active discussion, signals about the problems the team is currently facing, and adopt the company's lingo to work smoothly with them.\n\nthe second gives you a cheat sheet on how to impress teams with early positive impact. some things will take time to fix, and you should internalize these challenges, i.e. \"our infra isn't scaling\". but there are a surprising amount that you can easily help with, focus on these because they are things the team often neglect.\n\nthe third one gives you a valuable map of influence in the org. the more often names show up and the context in which they show up tends to be a different map of the organization that the one in the org chart\n\nfor all these, the greatest value isn't in the answers – it's in the asking. taking the meetings and listening shows the proper respect for the team. demonstrating mutual respect builds the trust required to make progress.\n",

It’s possible to spend your entire life in this mode, promising yourself you’ll enjoy it all once you get to the other side. <mark>The other option is to accept there is no other side. To realize that the assignment is not to get everything done perfectly, it’s to find ways to relish life even (especially) when you’re the busiest.</mark> I will never not be re-learning this lesson, but Oliver Burkeman’s essay on adopting a “deliberate defiance toward the inner taskmaster” has really kept it front and center in my mind this year.\n",

I was told i was comfortable in front of everyone which is a first. seems like i'm getting better at presenting. never felt nervous but my heart was beating faster and faster uncontrollably that i was losing my breath towards the end. still need to work on a confident voice. i sound like a high school kid that's still not sure about himself, like that kid from yiyi. i do not look or sound ~23.\n\nwas so tense and stressed from morning till 3:30. one of the most intense 2 hours and 10 minutes (extra time) of my life. i probably got 20-30% of it wrong, or even more, but i'm glad i got everything done. i was so close to leaving two questions blank, but i powered through, and was able to write down a proof that was sensible.\n\ni realized solving these problems require persistence, they're never obvious from the start, and it requires some thought, it's so easy to give up early on and say \"i can't do it\". i think i've wired to give up quickly without being patient enough with a problem. i think if you just keep chipping away on the problem, you can get somewhere, and with a bit of luck, and sound intuition, and solid math, you just might reach the end.\n\ni'm also realizing that math skills is so crucial, and i shouldn't skimp on math knowledge, even though i enjoy building and prototyping a lot more. i should put my stats degree to good use, double down on hard math and stats, understand the foundational stuff, because it will pay off in the future when i'm solving harder problems that require deep knowledge.\n\n---\n\nresearched into [Hume](https://www.hume.ai/), a series B startup that launched a foundational audio-language model – EVI 2 that integrates empathetic AI into any product\n\nhow does the models [work](https://dev.hume.ai/docs/resources/science)? it captures patterns from our speech and face:\n\n- Facial Expression\n- Speech Prosody (the way you say words)\n- Vocal Bursts (sighs, laughs, oohs, ahhs, umms, and shrieks)\n- Emotional Language (the words we say - explicit disclosure of emotion and implicit emotional connotation)\n\nthese reveal our preferences – whether we find things interesting or boring, funny or dubious, satisfying or frustrating, and and learns from these signals.\n\nthey call it RLHE - reinforcement learning from human expression.\n\nthese models trained with RLHE can serve as better copywriters, call center agents, tutors, etc, even in text-only interfaces.\n\ntheir goal: a future in which technology draws on an understanding of human emotional expression to better serve human goals\n\nthey released the first concrete ethical guidelines for empathetic AI : [Hume Initiative](https://www.thehumeinitiative.org/)\n\nthey also [publish their research](https://github.com/HumeAI/hume-research-publications/tree/main)\n\nthey have an [ai engineer + writer](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/humeai/jobs/4021608008) role that caught my attention\n\nhere's the job description\n\n> We are looking for an engineer and writer to help copyedit developer materials (API documentation, tutorials) and write broad-reaching technical content (blog posts, white papers). In this role, you will create content that helps developers understand the role of emotional intelligence in AI, imagine the future of AI interfaces, and integrate our API into wide-ranging applications. You will work closely with our developer relations, product, engineering, and research teams on a diverse range of content.\n\n> The ideal candidate is a philosophically minded software developer with excellent writing and storytelling skills. They have worked with (but not necessarily written) API documentation, especially for AI tools, have informed opinions about the future of AI, and have a strong interest in science.\n\ncurrently thinking of building an ios app where you talk to it throughout your day, and it summarizes your thoughts + tags your emotions with hume.ai, something like this [tweet](https://x.com/CherrilynnZ/status/1836881535154409629)\n",

God's grace is extended to all and this grace transform our hearts and mind, and that faith without action is DEAD (James 2:17), but by true faith, actions and good works ensue.\n\nthey had so much food. had conversations with old people. talked about malaysia and different cultures with food. talked about the pains you get when you start getting older. the members here have known each other for decades, and it made me miss home. i realize I won't get to experience growing old with a church, if I do achieve my dreams, and immigrate, then I'll be moving from church to church, it made me think about where i'll grow roots, and where I'll be settling down in the future, and how that shapes my life as i grow older.\n\nweather was so hot it was worse than malaysia. so glad it's getting colder from now. really made me appreciate the fact that i'm in SF and weather is basically perfect. and how much weather affects well-being.\n\ntried to study but kept context switching between paper trail, and the ray embeddings project, and fixing regression homework, and other stuff.\n\ncan't wait for finals to be over. studying for exam is one of the most time-consuming, stress-inducing, mentally exhaustive tasks, with little ROI depending on how you learn and how the exams are structured. I suppose you learn the value of deep understanding of concepts, and having high precision in your responses, and being able to perform under pressure.\n",

I love her.  \n> **William Parrish**: How perfect for you - to take whatever you want because it pleases you. That's not love.  \n> **Joe Black**: Then what is it?  \n> **William Parrish**: Some aimless infatuation which, for the moment, you feel like indulging - it's missing everything that matters.  \n> **Joe Black**: Which is what?  \n> **William Parrish**: Trust, responsibility, taking the weight for your choices and feelings, and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love.  \n> **Joe Black**: So that's what love is according to William Parrish?  \n> **William Parrish**: Multiply it by infinity, and take it to the depth of forever, and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I'm talking about.  \n> **Joe Black**: Those were my words.  \n> **William Parrish**: They're mine now.\n\n> **William Parrish**: Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. I say, fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back. How do you find him? Well, you forget your head, and you listen to your heart. And I'm not hearing any heart. Cause the truth is, honey, there's no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well, you haven't lived a life at all. But you have to try, cause if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.\n\n> **William Parrish**: Yeah, I certainly hope so. Yeah. I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now and every minute in between. And what I dream of is a man who will discover her, and that she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time, and has the grace, compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.\n\n> **Jamaican Woman**: It nice it happen to you. Like you come to the island and had a holiday. Sun didn't burn you red-red, just brown. You sleep and no mosquito eat you. But the truth is, it bound to happen if you stay long enough. So take that nice picture you got in your head home with you, but don't be fooled. We lonely here mostly too. If we lucky, maybe, we got some nice pictures to take with us\n\n> **William Parrish**: I thought I was going to sneak away tonight. What a glorious night. Every face I see is a memory. It may not be a perfectly perfect memory. Sometimes we had our ups and downs. But we're all together, and you're mine for a night. And I'm going to break precedent and tell you my one candle wish: that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say, \"I don't want anything more.\" Sixty-five years. Don't they go by in a blink?\n\n> **William Parrish**: It's hard to let go, isn't it?  \n> **Joe Black**: Yes it is, Bill.  \n> **William Parrish**: And that's life... what can I tell you.\n",

As Feynman has advised that the first principle of science is you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\n\nyou need empathy to put yourself in another person's shoes. to realize that you're not the center of the universe. that the people in front of you have vastly different backgrounds and experiences, who live in different worlds, speaking a different language.\n\nits hard to communicate ideas well. its even harder to connect with people on the same ideas. but when connection happens, its like magic.\n",

Someone gives you $50,000 for a project that explicitly can’t be a business. What’s the project you work on and why?\n\n- 50k isn't a lot of money in the US, but its a considerable amount in Malaysia. i would use that money to fund something similar to socratica and buildspace. i believe the culture of building and creating and collaborating is missing in Malaysia. it was only after i came to the US for college, and after landing in the right corner of the internet, my levels of agency and taste were significantly increased. i want a third space for the passionate builders, writers, and designers of malaysia to gather together, to cowork and collaborate, and just make stuff, for the fun of it. i think experimenting and play is an essential part of figuring out what you’re good at, what gives you meaning in life, and finding work that you love to do. a lot of people in Malaysia have a fixed mindset of what they’re able to achieve in life, living lives that are expected of them, and I want to change that. side note: i made some efforts to start Socratica-like co-work sessions in malaysia, but i dropped it when I came to the US for my masters, but it’s something i want to pursue in the future.\n\n1. What’s something you accomplished or created in the last year that you’re proud of?\n\n- i’ve been consistently writing a blog per day on my personal website (bneo.xyz) since april last year. i started writing technical content since i was a freshman in college, and i loved participating in essay competitions. i love the act of reading widely, and connecting and combining information from various sources, finding the patterns, and then organizing them a clear and smooth structure. i saw writing as communicating information. but i never saw the value in writing anything else, i was oblivious to the wide and vast ocean of personal blogging, when i discovered personal blogs and substack, where people share deeply personal and emotional writings, about how to live better, how to make friendships work in your 20s, how to love, and how to be more agentic, it triggered an inner reaction to also write about my own life, to document my own experiences, it gave me the permission to have a voice on the internet. having my own platform to dump my feelings, thoughts, ideas, and experiences has made me live life more intentionally and consume more thoughtfully.\n\n1. What qualities or skills best characterize the way you discover and solve problems?\n\n- curiosity and grit. i think with curiosity, you pay attention to the details, you ask more questions, and you ask the question within the question, and you start to discover the holes in many things in the world, gaps that can be filled with technology. with curiosity, you also talk to more people, you ask better questions, you read more blogs and books, and you form a map of things in your head, you combine things, and you come up with creative problems to solve. defining the problem is only the beginning, ideas are hard but execution is difficult. solving problems requires grit, it requires pounding a chisel at a rock over and over again, until you dig a hole that’s deep enough, that one day you hit a water vein. it’s showing up on the days where you don’t feel like it, and its doing whatever it takes to get whats in your head, the mindvirus, out into the world, into something real.\n\n1. Talk about a time a piece of writing, movie, conversation, art project, or other life experience changed your mind. How did your perspective change and why?\n\n- in 2020, malaysia went into full lockdown mode and i was at home with family. i had to take a semester gap break as I couldn’t leave to the US for school, so i spent a lot of time reading and learning ml. it was during this time that i developed GERD. it started a 3 year long journey into learning about what GERD was, going through cycles of acceptance and grief and depression and gratitude, learning to live with constraints, and adjusting my life style and taking half a dozen different medications to manage GERD. now that i’m temporarily cured with surgery, i learned a lot of things. first and foremost, health is the foundation to everything in life, it should never be taken for granted, and how quick it can disappear in any given day. and how you can easily feel stuck and hopeless, and how messed up the healthcare system is across the world, where medications take priority over understanding the human and the root cause. i realized life is short, and i might as well do what i love. i learned to prioritize, the right people and the right ideas, to focus on whats important. lastly, i saw value in suffering. it built up my tolerance for everything else i face in life, as long as i could find meaning in the suffering, i could get through anything.\n\n---\n\nInteract's Past Fellows describing interact ([1](https://interactfellowship.substack.com/p/b3dca211-d985-4b1b-84e5-36ca502d08f1), [2](https://interactfellowship.substack.com/p/describing-interact-no-2), [3](https://interactfellowship.substack.com/p/describing-interact-no-3))\n",

[paligemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma) and [gemma scope](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/gemma_scope) are things worth looking into.\n\ncontext switching from assignments, to the arc challenge, to the interact application, to some youtube videos, to the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind movie, to wishing i could read the dozens of book from sfpl, to this blog, to the time series grind for kevala, is probably a bad idea and i should just sleep. classic case of sleep procrastination. i' going to too many events, need to prioritize my time and say no to some of the events. the ROI of both technical knowledge and connections are not high enough. exposure to new things is great tho, talking to people there is 10x more valuable than the talks.\n",

Anything. Stop researching, planning, and preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn't matter how good or how bad it is. You don't need to set the world on fire with your first try.

No man can work well unless he can speak as the Great Master did of the joy set before Him.\n\non prayer\n\n> God knows what His Children want before they ask, but it proves their faith in Him to pray for what they want.\n\non religion\n\n> Religion is intended as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul’s welfare; and whichever form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.\n>\n> The best form of religion is, trust in God and a firm belief in the immortality of the soul, life everlasting.\n\non love\n\n> We speak of love, but what do we know about it, unless we see the power of love manifested; unless we are given the power to bestow, and a willing heart to bestow it upon, and within humanity. We say God is love, but if we do not feel the power of His love, we do not know anything about it. To be loved by others makes the power of love within our hearts grow.\n\non purpose\n\n> Man, like every other individuality, has an object and a purpose to fulfill; and, when he comprehends this, he will think too much of himself to stoop on any material action that shall bring him down from the highest position on the throne of his nature.\n\non wisdom\n\n> Knowledge is intelligence and its impress comes upon the mind. Wisdom is the desire of the heart prompted by God’s highest and most Divine nature and comprises all knowledge. Wisdom is the highest spiritual intelligence, while the natural man, through knowledge, can know nothing of wisdom.\n\non suffering\n\n> It is by suffering that God has most nearly approached to man; it is by suffering that man draws most nearly to God.\n\non burdens\n\n> There are but few on earth free from cares, none but carry burdens of sorrow, and if all were asked to make a package of their troubles, and throw this package on a common pile, and then were asked to go and choose a package which they were willing to bear, all would select their own package again.\n>\n> Your heartaches may be great, burdens heavy, but look about you, and with whom would you change?\n\non gratitude\n\n> God is all in all; and, i we cannot appreciate and worship Him in all things, we only worship part of God.\n\non good deeds\n\n> The test of a Christian life lies in deeds and actions, not in words, a true follower of truth and Godliness, not a follower of the impressions of the flesh nor the impress of the intellect alone, but endeavoring to let the heart be touched with the Divine principle of God’s truth; and that alone makes Christians. The instinct given to all of God’s children to seek happiness is a proof that happiness is a reality and within the reach of all.\n>\n> If we do good deeds to others and try to help them to live happier and better lives by being kind to them, and teaching them of the God germ within themselves, we in that way sow the seed, and God in His own way and time will make it grow. There is such a thing as mistaking Christian privileges for Christian attainments, and of imagining that we are what we ought to be simply because we know it. There is something in all hearts that can be reached, – some chord that will give forth sweet music if we only have the skill to touch it.\n",

Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.”\n> — Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nDear Ben, next time you’re sick, stop trying to study that linear algebra test and feeling anxious that you’re not taking anything in. Stop wondering if you’re able to finish it today even though you wanted to really badly. You won’t be able to do it. You can try, but your head will be buzzing and your eyes will be burning, and you’ll just be context switching (more than usual), watching olympic highlight videos, or reading the Paris Review Interviews books on your table, feeling like an absolute failure. Instead of trying to compensate this lack of success with some other activity that also requires mental effort, like making cheat sheets for the upcoming exams, or writing articles, or doing side projects that might help you land a job, just to feel a tiny bit productive, or feel like you accomplished something for the day, do this instead. Reach out to friends, sketch random things, read for pleasure without the guilt of not doing something more productive with your time, go to the rooftop and get some sunlight and take some deep breaths, take more naps, watch youtube videos for fun, laugh a little. I know you’re someone that vehemently participates in the achievement society, and not doing anything “useful” the entire day in SF sounds like the worst day in the world, but see it as an opportunity to give yourself a time of rest, to obey the Sabbath, to remind yourself that health is important and to never sacrifice it for money, and to be grateful for the people in your life, and be okay with not doing. and to talk to your parents.\n",

It is not one that is easy, it is one that is worth it.\n\nwow it's aug 1st. the past month has been a lot. a few lessons for myself from July.\n\n- when you feel like it's too late to do something, that's when you do it immediately\n- growth seems slow in the beginning, but habits make growth exponentiate, and effort gradually declines.\n- indecisiveness and overthinking are the surest way to feel regret. avoid it at all cost. if you want to do or say something, and it's reasonable, just do it. the benefits far outweighs any potential cost\n- if you're doing something. anything that is worthwhile. give it your all. don't do things half-heartedly or skip the details for short term benefits. hack your motivation, inject curiosity, learn for the sake of learning.\n- insecurity and social anxiety stems from the lack of identity and self-understanding. in these moments, you feel like you're not enough, that you're not worth it. but the reality is that it's all in your head, that everyone is human and just as flawed as you, and that everyone is mostly thinking about themselves. and you should just be yourself. learn how to obtain charisma and social prowess without losing too much of yourself.\n- introspect less and do more. identify the mistakes and fix them. avoid them in the future. don't exaggerate feelings by writing about them. doing is the better solution than trying to figure out why you feel a certain way by writing about how you're feeling. i.e. instead of writing about social isolation, just start talking to more people. be curious about others.\n- apply things that you learn. consuming is not work, creating is work. just start the project.\n- remember the goal isn't money or fame or comfort or an answer. it's finding joy and meaning in a difficult life. it's creating something useful. it's having fun and not taking things too seriously. it's people, caring and loving friends and family more than yourself. it's being kind and spreading positivity. it's all about what God wants from you. not the other way around. stop seeking answers, just keep searching for the next question.\n\n---\n\nSome insights by Charlie Munger\n\n- the art of storytelling is critically important. most entrepreneurs cant tell a story. money flows as a function of stories\n- education is the process whereby the ability to live a good life is acquired\n- building a great business is in service of building a great life. you don't have to sacrifice a good life to build your company\n- The world is not driven by greed; it's driven by envy\n- find big ideas from big disciplines to build an accurate understanding of the world\n- develop your own personal curriculum, follow your curiousity\n- good ideas are rare, bet heavily when you see them\n- dont buying or selling often, a successful career boils down to a handful of decisions\n- trust your own judgement, lone wolf temperament\n- inversion, get what you want by avoiding what you do not want. consistently avoid stupidity\n- reduce complex situations to their most basic unemotional fundamentals; genius has the fewest moving parts\n- assess and understand competitive advantage in every respect. product. market, trademarks, employees, distributions, societal trends, and the durability of that advantage\n\n---\n\n[Sisyphus 55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9D4vMX1EtM)\n\nyou're at the movie theater, everyone has left, the lights are still on and you're the only one still sitting there, completely alone, insisting the movie is not over yet.\n\neveryone, friends and family, the strangers on the streets, your coworkers, all suffer from pained nostalgia and yearning. from this you can feel a little closer to everyone. to know that all of us go through the same process of letting go, of moving on, of choosing life instead. choosing self-love, the only love that is guaranteed\n\nyour heart isn't the captain of the voyage of life. it is not your sole navigator. there are so many things out of your control, destiny, dumb luck, fate, wisdom. who is to say what will happen? where we're all heading?\n",

I spend 3 hours “trying” to study. in reality I have an hour of deep focus, the rest of the time I’m browsing books, reading some of them, daydreaming, thinking about the past, worrying about the future, feeling sad, feeling grateful, and everything in between. i’ve been losing the motivation to study. the first pre-quiz prep was very much fear driven, now that I know what to expect, and that I don’t have to put in that much effort, it doesn’t feel that scary anymore. I should be curious and learn wholeheartedly, but all i see is patterns and solutions I have to ingest into my knowledge base so that I can spit it out the next day. the more I study, the more worried I get, and I start suffocating. statistics is suffocating me. classes are suffocating.\n\nA few things I can remember from a few podcasts playing in my ear\n\n- his first novel was handwritten, 200 pages, the only copy was sent to a publisher, he wrote for the sake of writing.\n- Murakami shut down his bar to focus fully on a writing career for 2 years. if he was to pursue something, he wanted to go all in, 100%. if it didn’t work out, he told his wife, we will just open another small store\n- for his bar, he learned that he didn’t need all the customers to like his bar, just 1/10 of them, and he will focus on making them happy.\n- Murakami also got into running, he ran an ultramarathon of 62 miles in Hokkaido. he tells himself “I am not a living being, i am a machine”\n- steve jobs: simple is sometimes harder than complex. it takes effort to communicate simply, to write simply. don’t use 1000 words where an image would do. don’t take an hour where 10 minutes would do.\n- steve uses unusual but memorable words in his presentations, like the macbook is so fast it screams and the buttons are so nice you would want to lick them\n- use taglines for products “1000 songs in your pocket” for the ipod\n",

I have to be careful about the company and job I go for once i graduate. i might not even have a choice. but i believe there's always something to take out of everything. i'm often blinded by better opportunities, better styles and approaches towards things, i need to introduce more serendipity in my life, and follow my fears. that's where I'll be most alive.\n\n---\n\nVercel CEO - Guillermo Rauch [fireside chat](https://lu.ma/twg8v5ht?tk=w6qdBY)\n\n- never finished high school, father inspired him to work on web, moved to SF at 18, started and sold a company, worked on open source, started 5 projects (Socket.IO, Hyper, Next.js, ...) in the same year, wrote a book, spoke at conferences, CEO of Vercel today.\n- The ability to communicate and write and think well is the moat as AI gets more intelligent\n- fund raising, series A is storytelling, B is the proof of the engine.

The physicist Victor Weisskopf (also a pianist) noted, “What is beautiful in science is the same thing that is beautiful in Beethoven. There’s a fog of events and suddenly you see a connection. It expresses a complex of human concerns that goes deeply to you, that connects things that were always in you that were never put together before.” In short, the best science offers the same kind of experience as the best books or films do.\n\n---\n\nfoundations of good mental health\n\n- social connection\n- nutrition (food and hydration)\n- exercise\n- good sleep\n- routine (good habits)\n\nwhats one thing i can do today to improve one of the above?\n",

I can only think of the following:\n\n- why does your company exist?\n- how does it work?\n- who are your customers?\n- who are your competitors? What makes you unique?\n\nBecause how good your question is or how you respond is an indicator of how well you know about the field, and if you have nothing interesting to contribute, you're not a good person to talk to. it's also an indicator of how knowledgable you are. if you're someone who can have a conversation with anyone, it shows how well-read you are, how often you talk to different kinds of people.\n\ni theorize that people who are great at socializing and at telling stories are just people who's done it a lot of times. their training iteration is higher, their gradient descent reached a global minimum, the error function being the NOs in conversations, their accuracy rate of the other person enjoying the conversation is high, they've had more samples to finetune and learn from, learning the patterns and nuances of human communication. they're not underfitting on the model of socializing, and not overfitting on past experiences. they can adapt. they are charismatic. they are responsive.\n\nremember. humans love [responsiveness](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-the-humans-like-is-responsiveness). give more energy than what people bid for.\n\nSasha on how to be liked:\n\n> It takes attention and openness, and the confidence to present your character like it’s a fun mask you’re wearing rather than a lesson you’re desperate to teach someone. If you have that, it’s simple: when people put energy into you, attune to it, and give them harmonious energy backs\n\nBioForceTech corporation - Valentino Villa\n\n- providing sustainable and advanced biosolids management systems\n- Biosolids: residue from wastewater treatment plants\n- They are used as fertilizers which contain forever chemicals or PFAs\n- Buy organics to avoid biosolids\n- The BFT system\n- Biodrying: sludge has 20% solid and 80% water, to extract value from this, you need to dry them.

To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless, airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation.”\n> — C. S. Lewis\n\n---\n\n[Morgan Housel](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/morgan-housel-2/) on Knowledge Project podcast\n\n- Increasing surface area of luck is not luck. If you can do something that changes your outcome, thats not luck by definition. Luck is something you have no control over, your socioeconomic background, your family and upbringing.\n- Money is the oxygen of independence\n- 99% of buffets network was accumulated after his 60th birthday\n- He kept going for 33 years and on, his endurance and psychological temperament are key traits\n- Save money, be very patient, let it accumulate\n- the lack of fomo is the one trait you want to build wealth\n- Index funds: If you didnt own nvidia or faang, your odds of performing are very low. If you owned 1000 stocks in that index, only 20 of them performs\n- Wealth is the money that you don’t spend, the car or house you don’t buy\n- A lot of people who are successful are just walking anxiety disorders harnessed for productivity\n- The single word to describe all successful people is not passionate or driven, it’s tortured. They wake up every morning tortured. “I have to solve this problem, i have to get ahead.” They wake up anxious and depressed, tortured about achieving all those things\n- risk is anything that will prevent you from achieving the goals that you want\n- Risk is has a very personal definition\n- Personal finance is more personal that it is finance\n- Getting rich and staying rich are completely different skills\n- Lead by example for kids. Every time you say we can’t afford this, thats too expensive, i value this, i don’t value that. They absorb everything create a mental model\n- Don’t think that all poverty is due to laziness and don’t think all wealth is hard work. If you are ranking people and their values by net worth that is probably the most dangerous thing you can do with money. Its the most profoundly wrong takeaway for money\n- Its always the case, or its ideal, that there is some level of inequality in the world. The opposite of that is a nightmare. Because people’s skills are unequal. Once you get to some critical level, if enough people wake up and say this sucks, this system doesn’t work, then its going to reverse itself, and it becomes a pitchfork\n- There’s always a pendulum between labor and capitol, workers and investor, 1920s it was capital, 50-60s it was labor, now its back to capitol. But the past few years it had flipped around, its lower income groups had huge growths, the rich get richer and poor get poorer is not true\n- Read with a wide funnel and a tight filter, read anything that is mildly interesting, and stop if it stops working.\n- Comedy is showing how smart you are without being arrogant\n- it's much easier to contextualize stories than statistics. it has a human element, it has emotion embedded in it. stories are good leverage for statistics (i.e. Ken Burns WWII documentaries)\n- better storytelling:\n  - write for an audience of one (yourself), write a sentence that moves you, once you start thinking about an audience, you start to pander.\n  - don't forget how impatient everyone is. hook people in 5 seconds. people are most impatient in the first two seconds. most people only go a quarter into books (based on kindle highlight data). constantly ask yourself: what is the point i'm trying to make? get to the point and get out of people's way. read the story out loud, if you see people getting bored,leave out the parts that people tend to skip.\n- raise kids to be good adults, not good kids.\n",

I need a more structured routine. i need to streamline when i cook my meals, when i make my protein shake, when i call friends and family, when i do writing, when i code, when i go to events, when i study. lots of variables to optimize.\n\n—\n\npassed by warm springs and it brought back some familiar memories and feelings I used to have back then. i would be travelling back from SF. i was a differenet person back then. different problems, different wants and needs. it’s scary how much one year can change someone, but one year is a lot of time. I’m getting older, i have to start priotitizing, my decisions hold more weight now, my words and actions will start to determine the kind of person I am, my identity will start to shape into something solid, not malleable and spongy\n\nremember Ben. POSITIVE and BRIEF. the only two things you need to keep in mind when someone asks you something. AVOID NEGATIVITY and make it SHORT. don’t complain. don’t go into the details. just focus on the good things. there’s enough negativity in the world.\n\nnext time before meeting friends i need to start practicing some answers in my head. i also need to remind myself of some common courtesy, asking people what their name is, introducing myself and saying goodbye to everyone directly to their faces. smile, and be kind hearted. compliment people. it’s so hard to socialize in a group of 10 tho, i am so bad already with a group of 3. i can’t be put on the spot, i get a major case of spotlight effect. also I need to be better at telling stories, i guess I don’t talk to people enough, or people dont ask me questions. when people ask me things, I often answer so badly, when it comes out of my mouth i start cringing at the things I say. I don’t know how to fix that. how to i have charisma? I also need to participate in conversations, I often just let other people talk, when I can inject my own opinions and thoughts, I guess I never did that much when I was growing up, which makes it hard now. I feel like my opinion doesn’t matter? or that I might say something dumb?\n\nalso i realize hanging out with friends is going to cost money, and it's really bad to quantify how much it costs to hang out. it reduces the relationship down to the quantifiable, when you can't put a price tag on friendships. but it's also hard since i'm not earning anything as a student, and i'm using my dad's money to have a good time.\n\nso grateful for M for driving me back to home, was feeling so anxious about getting back late and not being fully prepared for quiz tomorrow, i’m glad I met him.\n",

    "content": "\n[ismael kadare's](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1105/the-art-of-fiction-no-153-ismail-kadare) paris review interview\n\n- \"**Negative creation** for a writer is what he doesn’t write. You need a great talent to know what you shouldn’t write, and in a writer’s consciousness nonwritten works are more numerous than the ones he has written. You make a choice. And this choice is important. On the other hand, one must liberate oneself from these corpses, bury them, for they prevent one from writing what one should, just as it is necessary to clear up a ruin in order to prepare the site for building.\"\n- \"I write two hours in the morning, and I stop. I can never write more—my brain gets tired. I write in a café around the corner, away from distractions. The rest of my time is spent reading, seeing friends, all the rest of my life.\"\n- \"Writing is neither a happy nor an unhappy occupation—it is something in-between. It is almost a second life. I write easily, but I’m always afraid that it may be no good. You need a stable humor; both happiness and unhappiness are bad for literature. When you are happy, you tend to become light, frivolous, and if you are unhappy your vision becomes perturbed. You have to live first, experience life, and later write about it.\"\n\n---\n\nreading about dog cloning, never knew this existed wow\n\n- hoi polloi - the masses, ordinary folk, used In a derogatory way to refer to popular opinion\n- Via Gen pets - $50k to clone your deceased cat or dog\n- the ethical issue of monetizing bereaved pet owners, and using two other nameless dogs/cats in the process of making the artificial pup/kitten\n- can’t recall much from the things I’ve read, worried my brain can’t store information anymore, its leaking with holes.\n\n---\n\nnotes from church\n\nLuke 22:3\nSatan entered (Eserchomai) him\n= metaphorically, it means an evil thought entering Judas, betraying Jesus for money\n\nLuke 19:9-10\ntoday salvation has come to this house, because this man is a son of Abraham.\nFor the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost\n\nAre you like Judas or the elder son in the prodigal son?\n\nThe dangerous sin is the hidden sin rather than the visible sin\n\nHidden sin is only between you and God\n\nSin is not necessarily criminal acts, it’s also your thoughts and words and behaviors and desires and greed and envy and spite and anger and bitterness and lust.\n\nCharles Spurgeon\n“The nearer a man lives to God, the more intensely has he to mourn over his own evil heart”\n\n---\n\nI like this church so far, even though they’re all Indonesians, it’s a relatively small church, a tight-knit community, of families and friends and young adults and kids and uncles and aunties. I think I can pass as indonesian being light brownish yellow? But for a moment I felt out-of-place, I wanted to be back in Ames at the chinese church. But it wouldn’t be the same anymore. There’s always stages in life, and it’s always difficult crossing from one to the next, there’s an uncomfortable transitory phase. You have to get used to the different languages, the new people, and the new environment\n\nBasketball was fun with them, haven’t played with a group in so long. I just keep missing my shots which makes me feel like a failure. i was mostly ok even though I played right after eating, so surgery actually helped a lot. Also it was windy and cold, so that’s my first time plying without sweating much.\n\nI'm actually so slow at math, couldn’t play 24 well, was always the last. Is it anxiety? Is it self-doubt? Is it brain fog? Is it sleep deprivation? Was I always this slow? I remember i took an IQ sample test wi try my neighbor and I was quick at math. Maybe I’m just slow now. I wonder if I can be fast again.\n\nWhat’s the right amount of studying? I study too little and I might be underprepared. And if I don’t do well, the damage was self-inflicted. Too much and it’s opportunity cost, I could’ve worked on something else. This is like a early stopping problem. When is the right time to stop the search, can studying be framed as a search problem? You’re searching for material that you might not be familiar with, and spend more time on the unknowns than the knowns. you practice and understand and encode, and hopefully it all sticks before you forget it all again in a few months or weeks. It applies to life too, when is the right time to stop and let go? To stop searching for answers? To stop spending so much time on the same things, chewing on the same bone, saying the same things, and just move on? Is anxiety and forlorn and longing a sign that it’s not worth clinging on? Or it’s all part of the process?\n\nI placed a hold on a ton of journal/diary/notebooks of famous writers from SFPL and I’m excited to read them. I want to write in a way that I won’t cringe at myself if I read it the next day or week. (Not a year since writing ability improves overtime and this shows progress). I think I’m still figuring out a structure for these blogs. Or at least some form of purpose or goal. So I don’t spend too much time thoughts dumping. Reading their journals can help me organize these daily entries.\n\nI read and consume so many things in a day. I find little snippets of text that I want to borrow for use in my own writing, like collecting sea shells and rocks from the beach. Also interesting ideas that I might want to resurface in the future. But how do I organize all of this? My brain only keeps what it needs. Is there still a use to reading if i only remember fuzzy and inaccurate versions of what I read? How can information retrieval be more accurate? Why is it that I forget what I read so easily?\n\nStaring at my iPhone at night in my dark room is probably not a great idea for my sleep. I need my desk light, please ship it asap Temu.\n",

The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps.” – Hesse, Siddartha\n\n- Freedom is no fear\n- The Hawaiian prayer Ho'oponopono is powerful for acknowledging that a wrongdoing has happened, asking for forgiveness, thanking, and loving. It can be directed towards other people, your emotions and feelings, to the universe, and to yourself. It is about restoring balance.\n  - I'm sorry\n  - Please forgive me\n  - Thank you\n  - I love you\n- i would honestly prefer take econs or finance right now, watching just 5 minutes of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8) and i realize i have zero finance knowledge\n- someone said reading Sylvia Path’s journal was like putting your head in an oven, i wanna read it so bad now\n- locked out of my room so I read New Yorker’s June 2024 issue that I borrowed from the library, read about Taiwan’s history and it’s pretty interesting. I realize for any current events, you can follow the thread of significant events in history that led to what you see today. Keep traversing backwards, ask the deeper questions, and you discover how things came to be today. Things like the Dutch ruling Taiwan, then Chinese, then Japanese, then the murky agreements between US and China and Taiwan that led to independence? I forget, I skimmed through the text. But much respect for Taiwanese, shouting “We are Taiwanese”. It also talks about how if an East Asia war broke out, it would have severe consequences, this guy wrote about how Japan should be preparing to defend Taiwan, and how you can make Taiwan an island that would deter China from attacking it. Oh and how XI is pushing to bring back Qing dynasty ruling? Unifying china into one?\n- It also made me realize how much of the world I don’t know, that I never cared to know. i never have a strong urge to support a particular cause or to fight against a system. maybe i’ve just been living in a safe and privileged bubble, or the people I surround myself with aren’t the activist/political type.\n- lately i’m forgetting why i’m here. why i’m spending so much of my dad’s money to be here. spending 4 hours at an art book fair, looking at art books by artists trying to make a living. enjoying myself, making a shrinky dink. i’m not pushing myself enough? the delicate balance between working hard and also relaxing. of doing what’s fun but also what’s hard. of striving for something great and also remembering that health matters. that every possible choice and action and word can change the trajectory of my life. i think i’m happy? am i happy? i still don’t know what i want. i feel like i want things other people want and that if i get those things i’ll be happy but i’m really not. why am i so empty sometimes? sometimes i realize i’m just surpressing a lot of emotions and I think i’m doing fine but it overflows. I’m sometimes excessively emotional and sentimental. but i guess it’s fine to let it out. i scroll back to old photos of people that are really far away, nostalgia is a double edged sword. i can’t look back to the past. i must resist the temptation of the past, a cozy and warm nook where I become apathetic. i remember how I felt so comfortable being with my family. i realize i do miss home, but being home wasn’t sustainable. i realize change is necessary. and change is hard. and change always requires sacrifice. and to live with that means acceptance, it means growing, it means holding up your end of the bargain of life, of doing good work, being kind, putting your gifts and talents to use, and being optimistic about the future, having indefinite optimism.\n- I should sleep. i think i need more structure for these blogs. i want to make a book out of these entries one day. I also want to write better. i have to read more letters, and Sylvia Path’s journal and Kafka’s letters? what genre is this? autobiography and memoir?\n",

I want to start building. I want to make full use of my time here in SF. I want to meet people, learn from them and start building something useful, something valuable. I wanna get into SPC and YC. I want the O1 visa.\n\nI want to work on fun side projects that get me out of bed, fired up, coding it non-stop. I don't want to be stressed out about quizzes or exams. I wanna be stressed out about whether I can get users, whether I have PMF, whether I'm working on the right idea. I don't wanna stress out about a few points that I lose on a quiz and whether my grades will be good enough. I don't want to be taking classes for the sake of classes. I want to learn for the sake of learning, to see my classes as an opportunity to go back to the basics to make sure I have the fundamentals and not as boring and tedious requirements that have no value to my future because I can just use ChatGPT to do most of the things in the future. I want to enjoy my time as a student after this is just gonna be work, I want to learn to live a little, and not be bogged down on the tiny details, optimizing towards the wrong thing, playing the wrong games.\n\nIt's hard to bring myself to study in SF because it to me was always a place of experimentation, of building, of excitement and creation. And these classes require me to go into the zone of doing a lot of practices that I feel like don't add value. But one thing about these exams is it made me realize that my flow of thinking is really flawed. I reach for the simpler and erroneous solutions really quickly and I don't spend time thinking through a problem. My brain is lazy. So I guess there's actually value in these quiz and exams. It makes me spend more time thinking about making sure that I learn how to notice patterns, how to apply prior knowledge onto a new problem and how to be more accurate and specific in my logic and thinking so I just have to work harder in terms of understanding and applying.\n\nI really like it when I get DM's from people on Twitter I think one of the joys of my life is when I have messages from internet strangers, people who I've never met and probably will never meet in real life. I like building an audience. I like to have a public presence, running experiments and creating artifacts. I like to provide value through writing or through code. But I still have so much to learn. I have a long way to go. I still don't know what I want, but I guess there's no rush to figure that out.\n",

I was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I always wanted to come to the US to achieve the typical American dream. I wanted to work in companies like Google or Apple and maybe start my own company one day. so I decided to do this program where i finished two years of college in Malaysia and then transfer to the US. I went to Iowa State university. It’s a peaceful college town, but can get a little bit too boring and it’s also very very cold in the winters. I was lucky enough to spend two summers in the bay area. I realized I loved the Bay Area so much. I felt like I belonged and I got to meet so many interesting and cool people and went to a lot of fun events. I felt very inspired and optimistic here. And ever since then I missed I wanted to come back. When I graduated, unfortunately because of the job market and health issues I decided to go back home. I took a six month break and the break was much needed. It helped me spend more time with my family, we travelled around Asia. I got to try out photography, made a fun little vlog, spent more time sketching, read a few books. I’m very glad I get be in this program. It's really exciting to be meeting people from different backgrounds. I get to go to a ton of events, putting myself out there, increasing my surface area of luck. I hope I can continue doing this for the time being, and stay here this time. A meaningful place for me is home, it's where I grew up, where my family is, it's where i'm most comfortable and myself.\n- i love chinatown, feels like home\n",

When my goals start to be more defined?\n- I’m definitely lacking sleep, i yawn almost every 5 minutes in class\n- arize ai shack 15, crazy that im back after a year\n- regret not talking to anyone and just getting free merch and food. also hard to network if im just a student here, i guess i need to build more, and build something worth talking about?\n- Rooftops for calls are perfect if it wasn’t so windy\n- I actually have 0 time for anything other than school and meal prep and walking and going to events now, the opportunity cost is high. Which event to go? What side project to focus on? When to do this homework? When to review that class? When to make time for social? Transportation eats up a lot of time.\n- can’t believe i spent 3 hours doing homework\n- So much pressure being around smarter people, which was the ideal environment to grow, i guess i wasn't prepared about how uncomfortable and distressing it can be. I guess its because im in school, and it can be zero sum, sma\n- i need to go to bed earlier\n",

Is there something else that is unmeasurable? Something more nuanced and indescribable?\n- How many examples of writing is sufficient to capture someone’s style, if different writings have different purposes (tutorials, explainers, op-eds, resources, etc) would u need the llm to selectively choose the writings that is suited for the chosen topic?\n- what counts as plagiarism? What are the factors you use to decide a writing is too similar? if you’re referencing material and writing about that topic, how much originality can you have without sacrificing the key ideas? I guess it depends on the goal of the writing, is it more opinion based or technical?\n- This means some forms of writing are easier to recreate and automate, i don’t think Joan Didion’s or Annie Ernaux’s writing is easy to recreate.

    "content": "\nmorning walk to ferry building\n\n- been feeling kinda empty and anxious ever since i arrived. It reminds me of what seneca said that moving to a different place won’t cure whatever problems you have, you’re just bringing them with you. i thought once i landed in SF id be happy again, and excited and positive, this is everything i wanted since i left, but why do i feel empty? was this not what i wanted? maybe it's the change, and change takes time, and change is good. i might be clinging on to the past. wanting things to stay the same. it's comfortable that way.\n- this past week was difficult. Learning how to manage my emotions, how to live with another person, to tolerate their quirks, and how to adapt and problem-solve when things don’t go as planned, how to be okay with uncertainty, how to let anxious and negative thoughts flow past me instead if letting it consume me, and how to not let nostalgia and sentimentality stop me from acting or feeling down, but use it as a tap on the shoulder to connect and reach out to friends and family, to remind myself to be grateful.\n- i love the bakeries here, also the display breads are real and composted at the end of the day, everyday, wow\n\ndolores park\n\n- where i tried grass in 2022\n- smaller than I remembered\n- the sun is intense, i'm worried about the UV index now, which apparently goes up to 10. i don't want to get tan. gonna sunscreen from now on\n- so hard to go past the surface level with these meetups, but I guess the goal of these is just surface level\n- so easy to just be a observer than an active participant\n- hanging around the snack area is a good way to start convos\n- most people are really not interested to talk to you, is it the way I look hmmm\n- 12 to 12, 12 ideas in 12 months\n- could've went to thailand and ship instead\n- is there anything else I can say about Malaysia besides the hot weather and cheap, good food\n- where are the asians that are our age, the people at this event are pre old, >25\n\nvalencia st\n\n- i love this street\n- i initially only wanted to visit dog-eared bookstore, but there was open editions (art books + gifts) and paxton gate (collectibles, rocks, fossils)\n- these stores were so nice, it took my mind off the anxiety and worries\n- got some rocks and nice used art books\n- i rmbr how messy and sketchy mission district is\n\nfisherman's wharf fireworks\n\n- it's pre fun walking with hundreds of people towards the same location, makes us all feel connected towards something, all aiming for the same goal. we need to have more things that unite people at this scale.\n- it is so bloody cold at the pier, i got major headaches from the wind, what is this condition? why do cold ears lead to headaches. is this Vasoconstriction?\n- fireworks are cool, there were rain shower types, smiley faces, big ones, moving ones, and more shapes and forms that I can't describe. there was a korean family behind us and they were so expressive it was so cute. like 오 (oh) i like sound and 와 (wa)\n- so nice to reconnect with B, haven't seen him in almost a year, his vibes are immaculate\n- walking conversations are the best and most natural\n- driving from Virginia to the bay in a sine wave form must be so fun, especially with two friends\n- i did the same thing last year with different people, and walked back with different people too. i wonder who I'll walk with next year.\n\n---\n\nwatching the fireworks made me think of this steve jobs quote, but instead of a rainbow, it's fireworks\n\n> \"Think of your life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon of this world. <mark>You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then you disappear. To know my arc will fall makes me want to blaze while I am in the sky. Not for others, but for myself, for the trail I know I am leaving. </mark>\"\n\nwhen you feel like there's no point to all this, remember you're not doing this for you, no. it's for your parents, your friends, for God, for people, for the future, for the world. it's not about the meaning you _try_ create yourself, it's what the world seeks from you. If you can't remember why you're doing all this, remember all the people that's rooting for you, supporting you, and loving you. it's not all about you. it's about what you can do for others. remember to be kind, to spread positivity, to hold on to joy when it comes, and extinguish cynicism the second it arrives. it's the least you can do. it's what makes all this worth it.\n",

They spend great effort and sometimes make great sacrifices for values that, fundamentally, meet no real needs of their own**. Perhaps they have imbibed the values of their particular profession or job, of their community or their neighbors, of their parents or family.\n>\n> Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one’s own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for.\n\nWe are only faintly aware of the habits of thoughts and behaviours that shape the course of our lives.\n\nWe don't live life, we sleepwalk through it.\n\nTo live more deliberately, he compiled 29 quotes, each striking a psychological chord, imbuing a philosophical truth, and sating an existential urge.\n\n_The highlighted ones are my favorites._\n\n- Unexpected intrusions of beauty. This is what life is. — Saul Bellow\n- Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. ―Rainer Maria Rilke\n- If you aren't going all the way, why go at all? — Joe Namath\n- Technique and ability alone do not get you to the top; it is the willpower that is most important. — Junko Tabei\n- The things that we love tell us what we are. — Thomas Aquinas\n- You don't have a right to the cards you believe you should have been dealt. You have an obligation to play the hell out of the ones you're holding. — Cheryl Strayed\n- <mark>When friendships are real, they are not glass threads or frost work, but the solidest things we can know. — Ralph Waldo Emerson</mark>\n- You never know what worse luck your bad luck saved you from. — Cormac McCarthy\n- All animals, except man, know that the principal business of life is to enjoy it. — Samuel Butler\n- My life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which never happened. — Michel de Montaigne\n- <mark>What punishments of God are not gifts? — J.R.R. Tolkien</mark>\n- Education is the lightest burden that you will ever carry. — My grandfather, John T. Landers\n- <mark>Love is never wasted, for its value does not rest upon reciprocity. — C. S. Lewis</mark>\n- Growth and comfort do not coexist. — Ginni Rometty\n- How we spend our time is how we spend our days. How we spend our days is how our life goes. How our life goes determines whether we thought it was worth living. — Keith Yamashita\n- You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it. — Rabbi Tarfon\n- What happened to the writer is not what matters; what matters is the large sense that the writer is able to make of what happened. — Vivian Gornick\n- A work of art is good if it has sprung from necessity. — Rainer Maria Rilke\n- If life teaches anything at all, it teaches that there are so many happy endings that the man who believes there is no God needs his rationality called into serious question. — Stephen King\n- God does not require that we be successful, only that we be faithful. — St. Teresa of Calcutta\n- <mark>There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle. — Albert Einstein</mark>\n- It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. — Albus Dumbledore by way of J.K. Rowling\n- A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. — Mario Puzo\n- If you want new ideas, read old books. — Ivan Pavlov\n- Joy is the infallible sign of the presence of God. — Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\n- Writing is like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way. — E.L. Doctorow\n- The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. — Steven Pressfield\n- What's terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don't need love when you do, or you like your work when you know quite well you're capable of better. — Doris Lessing\n- <mark>Many of us wrongly jump to the conclusion that our purpose can be measured by our productivity, even though in our own lives many of our most wonderful moments do not seem to “produce” anything but love, awe, or enlightenment. — Ellen Wilson Fielding</mark>\n",

    "content": "\n- my last time playing at this church for a while and I'm late to practice\n- found myself really tired to interact with people in the mornings, like \"ugh i don't wanna talk to anyone let me just sit in this corner\"\n- said a lot of goodbyes and got a lot of kind farewells by uncles and aunties, asking when I'll be back, and me responding \"not sure, going to find a job and stay there\" ironically many of their kids are overseas so I'm wondering why they would ask that question\n- just thinking about how the next time I'm back, the kids and uncle aunties will be older, maybe some won't be around anymore, and how there will be new faces too, and how I would be a different person at that point\n- but I haven't even started the program yet so there's no point thinking about the future that much\n- which makes me think, can you feel nostalgic towards the future?\n- now only mentions of me will persist in the church, questions like \"how's your son and daughter in the US?\" to the parents\n- feeling like I'm really low energy and dead at these meals with uncle aunties, and starting to notice that parents who are better at sharing stories, with emotion and vigor, that skill is passes down to their children, and I'm realizing my parents are low energy people, are there kids who develop this skill outside of their family? low energy parents but high energy kids?\n- still thinking about last night and how I was unable to express myself and tell stories about the US, about why I liked it so much, which made me doubt my true feelings, maybe the US isn't the best choice after all, maybe I just can't let go, what do I truly want and seek?\n- thinking about how my parents met these uncle aunties through church, and how they've lived in the same area for 30+ years, watching their kids grow up together, and how in the future I'll also decide on an area to settle down, and who are the people that I will be having meals with my potential children. church is such a connector. it is an effective social technology.\n- auntie saying her mom always used to say \"一转眼\" and time flies, and she finally realizes what it meant when she's 68.\n- first time going to an orchestra concert, soloist saxophone player is my sister's primary school friend\n- the audio quality is so so good, I've only listened to music through airpods and speakers, live music is heavenly\n- heard marimba playing in the first song, and that was the only time heard it for the whole show\n- seeing a Cymbal player in an orchestra just makes me think of that kid whose cymbal broke halfway in a show, and he just stood there and saluted the whole way through.\n- I respect a trianglist, first impression would be like \"that's so easy to play\" but I guess to perform it well also takes skill, and you shouldn't judge a book by its cover\n- \"a good show requires a good audience\", the conductor critiqued our hand clapping lol\n- most of the pieces just sound like ghibli music or james bond songs to me\n- the only thing that comes to mind when I see a saxophone player is the song \"Careless Whisper\"\n- jazz is so good, saxophone + piano + double bass is a killer combo\n- i was evaluating and not appreciating yet again, my music background makes it hard to not evaluate\n- thought about how the orchestra can go on without the conductor because musicians naturally memorize pieces and tempo, I noticed the musician don't actually look at the conductor while playing? but maybe the conductor makes changes last minute, since practice != performance, so real time changes are necessary?\n- seat was too comfortable, room was chilly with AC, it was dark, the orchestra was soothing, I couldn't help but fall asleep halfway\n- thought about how nice it is to be a part of an orchestra, or any group in general, feeling a sense of belonging is important for happiness and fulfillment\n- only a few more \"shopping for US sessions\", walks with family, meals, car rides, waking up in an AC room\n- recently feeling proud and grateful for a dad who was hard-working in providing for family and for my education, and for us to live comfortably, and how any success that I'm able to achieve in my lifetime is due to his contributions. I can't say I'm self-made.\n- realizing I can never talk about anything deep with my dad, only my mom. there's always a barrier and it might always be there until I make an effort to change that\n- i've been in this safe and comfortable environment for too long, i don't think i've been growing at all the past few months, it is time to leave\n- been feeling pain again recently and it's concerning, i might be eating too much lately with all these meals with friends and family\n- if i wasn't still having mild pain now, and feeling dizzy and nauseous and having pale lips (which a pharmacist says I might be 贫血), I'd be 100% ready and excited, but I can never be fully prepared, if I kept waiting until i was safe and healthy and ready, then I might never go at all. there's no right time I guess, it's all about taking a leap of faith, and trusting that things will go well, and even if it doesn't, I can still make it through because human beings are capable of adapting, having a growth mindset means suffering builds character and strength, and finding meaning in the pain, avoiding comfort, and also being grateful and thanking God at all times.\n",

Why go to the other side of the world?\n\nI mentioned there's something unique about the US you don't get anywhere else but I found myself unable to articulate what exactly.\n\nit's so much about my own idiosyncratic interests, fun experiences and warm memories, my personal values and beliefs, that I couldn't distill into words at that moment.\n\nthis happens a lot, and it frustrates me when I fail to explain myself, to bridge the gap of the differences between me and other people, so yet again, I'm writing down what I wish I could say at that moment.\n\nI'm dumping my messy and chaotic thoughts in bullet points, cause I'm tired and I have to get up early tomorrow because I'm playing at church, one last time, but also to capture them and examine them, study their shapes and colors and size.\n\n- the textbook answer that the ben from 2021 would give before going to the US is the bay area has all the largest tech companies and it's a place where they pay a disgusting amount of money for software and tech people. but it's more than that, because I actually experienced it, I spent\n- two summers in california and i felt alive and excited, I met many people and travelled to many places with them, so these good memories live inside of me, it was the place I wanted to be, and it was hard to leave because\n- it feels like i have unfinished business, I was always planning to stay there since the day I left Malaysia, but because health reasons I was forced to let go of that dream, and cali has been calling me back every since. and it was also the people, the friends\n- I have now are mostly there, and I want to live near my friends, so SF is the place I have to be. it's also a place to make new friends, because everyone who ends up in SF are there intentionally and strategically, they're all similar yet different in many ways, they're a hodgepodge of\n- high agency, cracked, creative, technical, dogged, and ambitious individuals, people who believe they can \"fix the world's problem through sheer will\", where work and life aren't two separate entities, but melded into one, because to them, meaningful work was crucial to a good life, they do what they love, and they love what they do, they're the ones who\n- start companies with their friends, build things that other people can use, who believes they don't have to just live in the world they see, but they can embrace it, change it, improve it, and make a mark upon it, and being in SF, we surround ourselves with them, in hopes\n- we can become more like them, and that increases our surface area of luck, to do great things too, because to be in this place means we get to dream, it's a place where\n- you can experiment, california has a sense of openness and new possibility, a space to think about what want to achieve in your life, the authority and permission to dream, to ponder about the possibilities of creating something that you love, to solve big problems with amazing people that you won't get the chance to, anywhere else.\n- i also think that since we're given the opportunity, because of my parent's hard work and capabilities, why not aim high and far, why settle for someplace close and safe. we're at an age where we should be taking risks, doing what's uncomfortable, and surround ourselves with the right people\n- and who knows what will happen in a year? in 5? in 10? maybe we end up back in Malaysia, maybe we take what we learn in the US and help make Malaysia a better place. hopefully we do, it's a chance to pay it forward, but there's no need to think that far\n- for now I have full conviction in SF, it's the best place to be and maybe once I experience it again, and I meet more people, my thoughts would be clearer, and I can evangelize my worldview, and explain myself the next time someone asks, why the US?\n",

carve out time for friends, whether calls or in-person hangouts\n  - live in the city where the largest number of your good friends are\n  - find 3-5 people you can be close friends with for many years, and hang out with their friends, and try to align your life choices around them\n  - go to a lot of things, parties, dinners. maximize serendipity\n  - meet people through hobbies, get really into running or something\n  - ride the coattails of your one really social friend\n  - be friends with people you can genuinely praise to everyone, you should be super proud of your friendships\n  - meet people through Twitter, tweet like your life depends on it and enjoy the returns\n  - write in public to meet people who like how you think, think in public\n  - develop an internal friend clock that tells you when to reach out to a friend \"it's been 3 weeks since you saw X, you should text them\"\n  - proactively ask about your friends' lives. many people have trouble talking about stuff that's troubling them, it's on you to ask\n  - be willing to take feedback, be willing to apologize\n- you can't \"win\" an argument, you can only lose the relationship\n- it's okay to let go of a friendship that isn't working anymore\n- your mistakes can and will damage the relationship; you cannot start over, but your mistakes can also be forgiven\n\nbegins to regret it as I feel intensely carsick, shorter notes now\n\n- [closeness](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/closeness)\n  - how to quantify what makes it possible for you to feel close to someone?\n  - closeness has a few elements: proximity, both physical and emotional, as well as mutual empathy, shared context and experience\n  - Joan Didion never had a thought without saying it aloud to her husband is aspirational\n  - a desire to share consciousness\n  - the appeal of extreme closeness: \"I find it both thrilling and exhausting to be in my own mind and sometimes I want to share the burden of it. I want you to know everything, to share the inexhaustible accumulation of experience with me\"\n  - the ability to really understand someone is often the product of innate compatibility and similarity\n- [knowing what i like](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/knowing-what-i-iike)\n  - many people think they know what they want, but they're pursuing the wrong things.\n  - when you get something that you've desired for a long time and it feels hollow, it means you've been chasing the wrong thing.\n  - there are things in life that feel good to get\n  - when what you get is what you want, it means you have taste, and it takes a lot of work to get there\n- [loving imperfection](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/loving-imperfection)\n  - if someone is externally perfect, they usually have all sorts of terrible wounds.\n  - if you love someone you are happy to pay the price, people assume love is about celebrating someone's amazing qualities, but true love is about accepting someone's flaws\n  - everyone is imperfect, and we just have to choose the imperfections we can love\n  - the goal is to find a tradeoff you more than tolerate – someone who makes you think, \"you're so imperfect, and I'm so lucky, I can't believe I get to spend my life with you\"\n  - we have to look for the trauma that slots into our trauma, the imperfection that moves us\n- [love in the time of hyperfixation](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/love-in-the-time-of-hyperfixation)\n  - we don't get to choose which fixation lasts and which won't\n  - the things we stick with are just the things we repeatedly fail to give up\n  - the entirety of what I know about love: \"in the beginning it felt like I couldn't control myself. And then it felt like I could control myself, but I still wanted to continue\"\n- [fewer, better thoughts](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/fewer-better-thoughts): making the right decision involves paying careful attention to the state of the world around you, and the state of your own internal landscape. watch people and watch yourself. what makes you feel good, what frightens you, what aches and why.\n- [17 hot takes about dating](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/17-hot-takes-about-dating)\n  - getting into a relationship is like buying a car; being in the relationship is like driving it. Don't spend two years trying to buy the car if you don't even know if you'll like driving it\n  - a great relationship is one in which both people are like \"Wow I got so lucky\". an okay one is one in which only one person feels that way.\n- [two years](https://web.getmatter.com/entry/12723047): consistency creates inspiration (if you know you have to write everyday, you'll think of something to write about)\n- [what makes me feel grounded](https://web.getmatter.com/entry/2833482): spending time with the people you love amplifies your \"youness\"\n- [practical magic](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/practical-magic): on rejection and secure attachment\n  - ask for things at the exact edge of rejection. if you're never rejected, you're too risk-averse\n  - be comfortable with rejection and with failure\n  - the willingness to be pushy and ask for things that aren't directly offered to you\n  - always go to the source. It’s important to know whose thoughts you’re referencing, and why. And whose thoughts they’re referencing.\n  - double down on your talents\n  - get good at building a strong feedback loop between \"I perceive X\" and \"I've confirmed that X is in fact true\". you'll start to trust yourself more. accurate self trust is more important than anything else\n\n---\n\nall my relatives keep asking me to take care of health and that's what matters the most\n\nand that now that I'm relatively healthier there's less worry, and that I've gone through it before and I'll be fine.\n\nI do think i'll enjoy life there a lot more than staying here.\n\nThe only thing stressing me out the most, the thing that really strikes fear deep into my core, is the pressure to find a good job that pays well (where I'll enjoy the work) to make my parents proud and to pay them back for the dent that I'll be making in my dad's bank account. the money that was hard-earned from going to the office everyday, taking multiple calls every hour.\n\nBut I'm sure I'll make it, either way. I have to trust in God more. Stay grounded, act according to my core values, surround myself with the right people, and take more risks. I just have to keep doing what I'm doing. And actually implement the advice that I've been consuming the past year or so in these blogs.\n\nIt feels like the week before the war, and you're on the frontline. you know you're subjugating yourself to a ton of challenges and discomfort and obstacles, and you constantly feel under-prepared and anxious of what's to come. but you still have to march forward. it's like you're trapped somewhere in sinking ship, the water is rising rapidly around you, you're floating and weightless, and air is running out, and you're about to take a deep breath before you dive under and look for an escape. you have to hold your breath, but you're not sure for how long. You just have to keep holding on.\n",

Make the first line interesting\n   - show them why they should care immediately.\n   - you have to know your audience well to do this.\n   - examples\n     - (Sharing launch results): share the metric movements that the audience cares about.\n     - (Asking for collaboration): highlight the expected outcomes from the work that are most important to the audience.\n     - (Raising awareness for a problem): explain the severity of the problem in a way the audience understands.\n2. make your ask clear\n   - either share it **first thing**\n   - or **at the end** after providing the relevant context for them to understand your ask\n   - Before:\n     > Service X is broken. I think it's because of the push. Could you help me revert a diff？ This change went out at Y time and I can see a clear drop in the success rate just after that. I'm not sure though still and want a second opinion\n   - After:\n     > Prod is down, can you help me revert a diff？\n     >\n     > Service X is broken. I think it's because of the push. This change went out at Y time and I can see a clear drop in the success rate just after that. I'm not sure though still and want a second opinion\n3. write simply\n   - the more simply the writing, the more your idea will get through to the audience\n   - if you can remove a word and preserve the meaning, do it\n   - if you can replace a complex word with a simple one, do it\n\nthese were for short writing, he shared more [tactics](https://www.developing.dev/p/writing-tactics-part-2) for longer writing, i.e. planning docs, announcements, design docs, and more.\n\nThe main ideas are to include a tl;dr and format the writing to optimize for skimming (people skim in an [F-shaped pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered))\n\n- add a tl;dr: put what your audience must know in a few lines, the most important takeaways\n- add a table of contents: for longer posts, let people jump to what they care about\n- add section headings: gives people a sense of how relevant a section is\n- use bullets and lists: much easier to skim than paragraphs, the spacing separates ideas clearly, delivering the key points to readers\n- bold the main points: draw attention to what matters most, use your judgement and use appropriately\n- break up long paragraphs: add line breaks where it makes sense, don't let paragraphs get too long\n\nmore tips in this article by Nielsen Norman group [5 Formatting Techniques for Long-Form Content](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/formatting-long-form-content/)\n\nLastly, you get better at writing by doing and asking for feedback by from people who write well.\n\nWrite, reflect on feedback, iterate.\n",

He is currently the the CVP and Deputy CTO at Microsoft.\n\nI love the way Sam talks, his words flow smoothly and you can easily capture what he's saying. Hearing him talk about the creation of Google Docs, his thoughts on AI, and his advice for future software engineers was so compelling, I had to capture some of his ideas down.\n\nBelow are notes from his chat on First Round Capital, [Developing technical taste: A guide for next-gen engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2ycezu4CJ4)\n\n---\n\n### lesson on market timing\n\n- the best time to act on an idea is when it feels uncomfortable and challenging due to the early times\n- the things that are worth doing are really uncomfortable\n- JS was buggy and cloud infra was nonexistent when sam was developing Gdocs\n- don't wait till things get easier, by then you lose the first mover advantage and there's more competition\n- engage with difficult problems early, criticisms on AI today are engineering problems to be solved\n\n### What is technical taste?\n\n- a \"bag of heuristics\" you've collected over time to make accurate technical judgements on new things\n- how? look at your past experiences and develop a sense of what works and what doesn't\n- it's a clearly articulated set of principles that's iterative, i.e. for space X, they know what they're optimizing for, the cost to get a pound into orbit, chipping away at all the things.\n- it's good judgement about how they approach technical problems and decide what to optimize for and what to ignore, and how the tech is going to work, and not distracted by all kinds of extraneous stuff.\n- use your technical taste and fail early rather than late, this way you can course correct and iterate\n- don't be a pessimist, be optimistic and make a lot of mistakes\n\n### ask \"What If\" questions\n\n- have a \"what if\" mentality, exploring possibilities rather than being defensive, and focus on \"why not\", why this or that wouldn't work\n- a healthy team embraces new ideas and experiments, engages in constructive arguments on potential solutions, and openly collaborate\n- ask \"what if we tried this?\" more\n\n### advice for future engineers\n\n- cultivate playfulness and curiosity\n- you get the most value from messing around, playing with things, experimenting and following your nose and doing stuff that you don't know why you're doing it, because it's just interesting to you\n- focus on breaking complex problems into simpler parts, solve the minimal thing\n- don't be attached to technical skills, emphasize on problem-solving skills and\n- learn quickly and adapt to change\n\n## building a winning product\n\n- prioritize user convenience and speed over feature completeness\n- continuously refine the product by listening and talking to customers\n- avoid feature wars, focus on your unique value prop rather than matching competitor features\n",

I'm guessing he's high school age but not sure\n- gaming on smartphones is such an ick for me, it reminds me of my past life wasting time on mobile games\n- lots of practices of rituals and prayers to goddess throughout the movie made me glad I'm christian, I find it sad people stick to these practices because their parents, and their parents, observed them, it's passed down knowledge and tradition that's hard to break off due to reverence and obedience\n- the cousin looks like one of the new jeans member\n- never thought much about chasing after inheritance, seems like a lazy and dishonorable thing to do, but if you're poor and wasn't born into a good family that's well off, it's understandable, my privilege is showing.\n- wonder what happened to M's dad\n- I like that montage of M taking pictures as he travelled to amah's house, I'm guessing he's doing that cause it's his first time going at that age? or maybe it was all for the house listing for areas and things around.\n- I like the green of amah's house\n- wish my grandma was just a train ride away\n- this grandma is so sassy in a chinese way\n- pray to guanyin = no beef\n- you have to spend enough time around them to not even notice the smell\n- the only thing old people want is time with them\n- amah's life isn't that bad, she sells congee early in the morning, she sees an old friend on the way back\n- the street where they walk, with a train along the path has japan vibes\n- the film locations reminds me a lot of Malaysia, specifically Penang or Ipoh or Johor?\n- a rich son that trades stock, a daughter that works at a supermarket, and a son that owes money (from gambling?), seems like there were issues with agong, money related, which resulted in children like this.\n- M is really good at responding to everything in a lighthearted and fun way, I got what my sister meant when she said he has high EQ\n- the way she says I'm used to being alone, that's what life is like, but the hardest day is the day after chinese new year, when the fridge is full of leftovers and she's the only one to finish them is SO heart-wrenching.\n- what's the solution to loneliness for the aging? i read so much about maintaining and building friendships, but what about how to keep parents close to us (distance-wise and emotionally), for those who have to immigrate for a better life?\n- this movie unearthed my deep-rooted fear of getting old\n- stairs are the bane of existence for old people\n- amah crying about pain in bed and asking mom and dad to take her with them is so heartbreaking\n- the way the rich son prioritizes his own family more than amah made me think about how an uncle at church said \"老公是属于老婆的\"\n- he steals money and disappears, but amah still gives the house to him, a mother has the most heart to forgive all transgressions\n- old folks home scene made me think about how many old people spent their last moments alone with only nurses and caretakers around, and not their loved ones.\n- sons get the assets while daughters get the cancer is such a dark joke\n- asking a mom which child / grandchild they love the most is kind of an impossible question to answer\n- there is no (earthly) love greater than a mom's love\n- do all old chinese people like watching chinese opera, wait the agong watched victoria secrets lol\n- M's lullaby to amah in her final moments :,)\n- I like how he knocks on the coffin to talk to amah\n- flashbacks where the main character discovers something that makes them realize all the things they never realized until its too late (how amah has been depositing money for him since he was young just because he asked) is so emotionally satisfying and healing, it gives me goosebumps\n- I'm so reactive to people crying that I cry a little bit too, specifically that scene when the children and M was on the back of the truck with the coffin.\n- when M said \"we're reaching the house I bought for you\", that really got me\n\noverall, I'm not close to my grandmas and I used to see them only once a year for CNY, so this movie just made me think of my mom the entire time and who will be take care of her when she's old and sick, and if I'm in the US (fingers crossed I make it) or somewhere else, and my parents are thousands of miles away, I'm worried about their well-being, and not being able to visit them often. Although it's still 20 years out (they're early 60s now), but it's something to think about. My dream is to immigrate them to somewhere nice, like Canada or Europe but that's a pipe dream for now. right now my focus is to graduate and get a good job. it's the best thing I can do for now for them.\n",

    "content": "\nSince I'm starting an MSDS next month, I have to pick up Data Science again.\n\nI found this [paper](https://drivendata.co/insights) with a ton of insights into best practices for data science.\n\nbelow are some notes:\n\n### intro\n\n- **good**: data science provides a powerful toolbox for increasing efficiency, driving growth, automating expensive processes, and making better decisions.\n- **bad**: Too many real-world projects are chaotic stew of hand-tweaked algorithms, cherry picked examples, and brittle, undocumented, untested research code.\n- the main bottleneck in data science are no longer compute power or sophisticated algorithms, but <mark>craftsmanship, communication, and process</mark>\n- the 3 basic premise\n  - data science is a kind of software work,\n  - correctness and reliability of software depends on development practices\n  - data science quality depends on SWE quality\n- the aim: work that is accurate and correct, but also **can be understood**, work that others **can collaborate on**, and that **can be improved and built** upon in the future even if original contributors have left\n\n### Rule 1: Start organized, stay organized\n\n- good analysis is often the result of scattershot and serendipitous explorations; tentative experiments and trying out approaches that might work are all part of the process\n- but it should start with clean and logical structure\n- the [cookiecutter DS](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) template is an effective structure where:\n  - data is always in `/data`, raw is in `/data/raw`, and final for analysis is in `/data/processed`\n  - notebooks are in `/notebooks` with a numbering scheme\n  - project-wide code is in `/src`\n- this sensible and self-documenting structure allows others to understand, extend, and reproduce your analysis\n- other people will thank you: newcomers can understand without suffering through documentation, every data scientist in a team can open any historical project, and immediately know where to find the inputs/outputs, the explorations, the final models, and any reports generated\n- you will thank yourself: if you try to reproduce your analysis, you're not asking questions about which `.py` file to run to get things done\n\nBelow is the full structure of their template\n\n```text\n├── LICENSE <- Open-source license if one is chosen\n├── Makefile <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make data` or `make train`\n├── README.md <- The top-level README for developers using this project.\n├── data\n│ ├── external <- Data from third party sources.\n│ ├── interim <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.\n│ ├── processed <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.\n│ └── raw <- The original, immutable data dump.\n│\n├── docs <- A default mkdocs project; see www.mkdocs.org for details\n│\n├── models <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries\n│\n├── notebooks <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),\n│ the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.\n│ `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.\n│\n├── pyproject.toml <- Project configuration file with package metadata for\n│ {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} and configuration for tools like black\n│\n├── references <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.\n│\n├── reports <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.\n│ └── figures <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting\n│\n├── requirements.txt <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.\n│ generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n│\n├── setup.cfg <- Configuration file for flake8\n│\n└── {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} <- Source code for use in this project.\n│\n├── **init**.py <- Makes {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} a Python module\n│\n├── config.py <- Store useful variables and configuration\n│\n├── dataset.py <- Scripts to download or generate data\n│\n├── features.py <- Code to create features for modeling\n│\n├── modeling\n│ ├── **init**.py\n│ ├── predict.py <- Code to run model inference with trained models\n│ └── train.py <- Code to train models\n│\n└── plots.py <- Code to create visualizations\n```\n\n### Rule 2: Everything comes from somewhere and the raw data is immutable\n\n> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. – Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas\n\n- the fundamental theorem of reproducibility: every conclusion drawn in an analysis must come from somewhere\n- DAG: Every piece of data or work product in an analysis tree should be the result of a dependency graph that can be traced backwards to examine what combination of code and data it came from or run forwards to recreate any artifact of the analysis\n- if you trace any product far enough upstream, you will end up at one or more scripts that extract raw data, or the raw dataset itself\n- do not have misc data files in the project, at least write own how the data was acquired in the README\n\n### Rule 3: Version control is basic professionalism\n\n- data should (mostly not be in VCS)\n  - not usually a good idea to store intermediate or cleaned data products, whole idea of reproducible data pipelines is everything should be obtainable with clear provenance from original, raw dataset\n  - impractical to store data of a certain size, will clutter commit history and inflate repository size on disk, tracking code changes alongside data change will be unbearable\n  - putting data in code tracker is conceptual mismatch: we expect raw data to change often over time (daily report requires new data everyday)\n- data stored in db or warehouse has its own versioning (timestamp, IDs)\n- raw data can be archived and shared using basic storage (hard drive, S3, etc.)\n- check out data versioning tools\n  - [Data Version Control · DVC](https://dvc.org/)\n  - [dat-ecosystem](https://dat-ecosystem.org/)\n  - [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)\n- why source control?\n  - look at \"diff\" to spot unintended changes and extra debugging code\n  - DS accretes small decisions and assumptions, helps track individually and get feedback on mathematical validity, statistical relevance, and implementation of the decisions\n  - promote sharing knowledge\n\n### Rule 4: Notebooks are for exploration, source files are for repetition\n\n- notebooks are tools for rapid, iterative, and serendipitous explorations that give a tight feedback loop showing the immediate results of change\n- also invaluable as artifacts for communicating and explaining analyses\n- why notebooks bad for reproducability\n  - manually opening and running cells is not automation\n  - hard to test and introduce complications that go against the grain of common system conventions (logging, where output is directed STDERR vs STDOUT, return of error codes, what process fails on uncaught exceptions, working directories, etc.)\n  - challenging for source control, merge conflicts\n- naming convention that shows \"owner\" and gives sense of order of analysis\n  - `<step>-<initials>-<description>.ipynb`\n  - ex: `3.1-BN-visualize-distributions.ipynb` where step is a loose idea of where in the end-to-end workflow this notebook falls\n- the solution: `.ipynb` -> `.py`\n  - continuously extracting common building blocks out of the notebook into source files that can be **centrally tracked** and used from any other notebook\n- benefits:\n  - separate multiple concerns into logical units, so data layer (ETL) is not mixed with modeling and experimentation (where notebooks shine), and are not entangled with output layer (final result of workflow, where predictions, reports sent to a database)\n  - prevents duplication of code (how errors creep in), rather than being stuck in one notebook, changes to commonly used code propagate across all notebooks\n  - allows pieces of pipeline to run without running the entire pipeline (ex: tweak hyperparameter and refit model doesn't require sitting through long-running data extraction task)\n  - enables test to verify functionality and correctness\n  - shows code changes across commits in VCS\n- embrace refactoring\n  - write utility code in commonly accessible modules, write a couple of quick tests, import it into notebooks\n- when to move out of notebook?\n  - matter of judgement, taste, and pragmatism\n  - notebooks > code, for demonstration and experimentation\n  - if a piece of code is the focus of the work, or solely designed for the analysis, leave it in\n  - if it's a necessary building block but not worth showing, move it to a separate file that can be tracked in VCS and tested\n\n### Rule 5: Tests and sanity checks prevent catastrophes\n\n> Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.\n> – Michael Feathers\n\n- testing data science code is hard\n  - testing on large datasets = long-running test\n  - we expect data to change over time, downstream values fluctuate\n  - often use randomness on purpose (to sample or fit model), hard to assert whether changes are meaningful or due to expected variation\n  - visualizations are challenging to test\n  - notebook env not the same level of tooling for test discovery and running\n- what code to test?\n  - [sanity check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_check?useskin=vector#Software_development) and [smoke test](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software)?useskin=vector>)\n  - helpful when examples have possible edge cases such as null values, zeros, shape mismatch, etc.\n- what kind?\n  - test that operate on \"toy examples\" with tiny amounts of data or extremely small arrays make it clear what is being tested and what values are expected\n  - **unit test**: the right tool for verifying processing or math code, tests focused on a specific operation being correct in isolation\n    - how? take a sensible number of expected input-output pairs (taken from reference, calculated with an alternative package, or worked out by hand) and demonstrate that the new code produces the expected output\n- recommendation\n  - write test for any code refactored out of notebooks\n  - write tests with sample data to confirm logic works as expected\n\n### Rule 6: Fail loudly, fail quickly\n\n> This is a problem that occurs more for machine learning systems than for other kinds of systems. Suppose that a particular table that is being joined is no longer being updated. The machine learning system will adjust, and behavior will continue to be reasonably good, decaying gradually. Sometimes tables are found that were months out of date, and a simple refresh improved performance more than any other launch that quarter!\n> — Martin Zinkevich, “Rules of Machine Learning\n\n- ml is dangerous models can often appear to give reasonable predictions despite serious programming errors or data quality issues\n- principles of [defensive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming?useskin=vector)\n  - Conspicuous: worst failure is a silent one\n  - fast: if a function is going to fail eventually, it might as well fail now\n  - informative: provide messages\n- ex: a model fitting pipeline, one of the feature is mean(col_from_raw)\n  - assume raw data is not generally expected to contain missing values\n  - mean() function in many packages ignores nulls without complains\n  - a damaged sensor or buggy code change causes column to silently start having non-random null values\n  - this new mean value could be strongly biased and lead to bad predictions, and will make costly business decisions\n- solution?\n  - make assumptions concrete and enforce them at runtime\n  - bail out immediately and loudly if assumptions are violated\n  - from example above:\n    - check input column before applying transformation\n    - immediately log that the non-null assumption was violated\n    - halt processing script with a failure exit status\n  - point and call\n    - your pipeline should not be more permissive than necessary\n    - set a norm thinking explicitly about where to be permissive and strict\n    - ex: add assertions that values can be floating point or null is an intentional way to show sources of possible error\n\n### Rule 7: Project runs are fully automated from raw data to final outputs\n\n- it should be obvious for anyone to initiate the process for raw data -> finished product\n- instructions in README are not enough, you can miss crucial steps, or it's too vague, or not updated.\n- when data pipelines are not automated, they are not reproducible\n- use a build tool\n  - keep pipeline working and run it everytime you make a non-trivial change\n  - CICD: mainline branch is always in a runnable state and has its tests run every time a change is committed\n  - for a data project, to reproduce the results of a project, anyone should be able to run a \"default\" pipeline without typing out or understanding the various knobs and settings\n  - it can be as intuitive as running a single command from proj dir\n- make env reproducible\n  - same interpreter and same libraries with identical versions to ensure matching results\n  - requirements.txt with specific versions of packages\n  - for more complex requirements, use docker\n- make randomness reproducible\n  - set a random seed in a central location\n    - note that random, numpy.random, torch.rand each use their own seeding mechanism\n    - use an explicit random number generator object where you set seed in one location and track its use\n  - reproducing an analysis using probabilistic methods means pseudorandom number generators must be initialized with a known state to induce the same values each time\n\n### Rule 8: Important parameters are extracted and centralized\n\n- magic numbers is a bad practice of sprinkling critically important values which affect the program's behaviour throughout the codebase\n- data projects often end up with an excessive number of ways to parameterize scripts and functions\n- consider a model training pipeline that cleans raw data, fits several models, and outputs predictions\n  - all of the model parameters multiply possibilities with the \"meta\" choices like train/test ratio, cross-val params, ensemble voting params, to make a combinatorially overwhelming universe of possible inputs for a single run\n- AVOID: one notebook for each model and then copy pasting setup code, or reuse notebooks by changing parameters by hand, or have parameters in multiple code files.\n- remember the goal is not just making changes, it's to see how our changes affect outcomes\n- ideal: running another experiment = changing settings in a central config file, getting a cup of coffee, compare most recent log to past experiments\n  - it also documents the changes with the output for yourself and for colleagues\n- imagine a declarative settings file `config.yml` file like below\n\n```yaml\nn_threads: 4\nrandom_seed: 42\ntrain_ratio: 0.5\nlog_level: debug\n  features:\n    use_log_scale: true\n    n_principal_components: 4\nmodels:\n  xgboost:\n    max_depth: [2,5,10]\n    n_estimators: [50,100,150,200]\n  random_forest:\n    criterion: [\"gini\",\"entropy\"]\nensembling:\n  voting: [\"soft\",\"hard\"]\n```\n\n### Rule 9: Project runs are verbose by default and result in tangible artifacts\n\n- capturing useful output during data pipeline runs make it easy to figure out where results came from, making it easy to look back and pick up from where it was left off\n- example of a run of experiment codified in a config file\n\n```txt\n2022-11-01 14:10:02 INFO starting run on branch master （HEAD @ 37c02ab）\n2022-11-01 14:10:02 DEBUG set random seed of 42\n2022-11-01 14:10:02 DEBUG reading config file\n2022-11-01 14:10:02 DEBUG ... settings：｛\"n_threads\"： 4， <..snip.... .>｝\n2022-11-01 14:10:03 INFO reading in and merging data files\n2022-11-01 14:10:39 INFO finished loading data: 2,835,824 rows\n2022-11-01 14:10:40 WARNING ... dropped 126, 664 rows where ID was duplicated （4.47%）\n2022-11-01 14:10:41 WARNING ... dropped 2,706 rows where column 'total was null （0.09%）\n2022-11-01 14:10:41 INFO creating train/test split\n2022-11-01 14:10:41 INFO ...  train: 0.5 ［1,353,227 rows］\n2022-11-01 14:10:41 INFD ...  test : 0.5 ［1,353,227 rows］\n2022-11-01 14:10:42 INFO starting grid search cross validation ..\n2022-11-01 14:21:01 DEBUG ... 30/120\n2022-11-01 14:31:46 DEBUG ...  60/120\n2022-11-01 14:42:31 DEBUG ...  90/120\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 DEBUG ... 120/120\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 INFO finished cross validation, writing best parameters\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 DEBUG ...  runs/2022-11-01_14-10-02/parameters/xgboost.yml\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 DEBUG ...  runs/2022-11-01.\n_14-10-02/parameters/random_forest.yml\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 DEBUG ...  runs/2022-11-01_14-10-02/parameters/adaboost.yml\n2022-11-01 14:53:03 INFO training voting classifier on ensemble of 3 best models..\n2022-11-01 14:53:19 INFO making predictions\n2022-11-01 14:53:22 INFO writing results to runs/2022-11-01_14-10-02/results.yml\n2022-11-01 14:53:22 DEBUG ... results: precision=0.9624 recall=0.9388 f1=0.9514\n2022-11-01 14:53:23 INFO writing predictions to runs/2022-11-01_14-10-02/predictions.csv\n```\n\n- above we are storing important history like how many rows were dropped, what the train/test split was, how long it took to run, the performance, the best parameters, etc.\n- imagine if you introduce a new feature, you want to see what impact that has on overall performance as well as processing time, instead of eyeballing, you can simply look at the result data files\n- this allows rapid iteration through experimental settings, you worry less about missing settings or performance backsliding from misc changes, and focus more on actual modeling subject matter and business case\n- this ability to audit how results came about -> eases detecting and fixing any downstream problem\n\n### Rule 10: Start with the simplest possible end-to-end pipeline\n\n> a complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system\"\n>\n> – Brian Kernighan and John Gail, Systemantics\n\n1. start with proper form, fill in proper function\n   - work from raw data all the way to finish product before going back to improve all of the pieces\n   - all projects have a time constraint, so it's better to get the entire pipeline glued together, even if some parts are basic or even faked\n     - even if you use a naive model that has poor accuracy, very few features are cleaned from raw data, if outputs are rough,\n   - aim for an automated pipeline, then work on it piece by piece\n2. start with basic tools and models\n   - for numerical predictions from tabular dataset, the potential accuracy buff with deep learning does not justify the added complexity and decreased interpretability, compared to plain old regression or decision trees\n   - the decision to add additional complexity should not be made lightly, but delayed until the [last responsible moment](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-last-responsible-moment/) when its clear the tradeoff is going to pay dividends\n   - ex: there are powerful libraries for orchestrating from raw -> clean data to trained models to new predictions, but consider whether the old and boring Make tool can do the job\n   - ex: instead of perfectly handling every quirk in a dataset, purposefully decline to handle edge cases by failing fast on bad inputs (rule 6) or loudly filtering unhandled cases (rule 9)\n     - a column \"12.10 USD\", instead of doing something clever like a custom struct with enumerated data type representing the currency is in use, if you know it'll only be in \"USD\", just do a split on space \" \" and assert the second value is in \"USD\" (rule 5)\n3. you don't have to use all of the data all the time\n   - exploratory analysis and scaling ana analysis are two different chores, they can be tackled separately as long as the bigger picture is in mind\n   - keep exploratory feedback loop fast by working with representative samples\n   - sometimes a naive sample is enough for the task at hand, i.e. getting all data cleaning code in order or making sure a preprocessing step results in useful features\n   - save the parallelization for later, once you feel confident about the modeling assumptions and data pipeline, they can be translated for parallelization\n\n### software lessons\n\n1. use version control\n2. keep it simple, stupid (KISS): simple solutions are easier to reason, easier to debug, and easier for new collaborators to understand. only add complexity if it serves the ultimate goal of the project, after careful consideration\n3. separation of concerns: aka, loose coupling , minimize the amount each component of a program needs to \"know\" about other pieces\n4. separate configuration from code: dispersing settings throughout codebase makes it difficult for anyone trying to understand the logical flow, centralize and codify important settings to make the effect they have on outputs obvious.\n5. You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI): abstraction is powerful and costly, [start with a concrete case](https://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork) and only generalize when needed.\n6. premature optimization is the root of all evil: [rule of thumb](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast) is to \"make it work, make it right, make it fast\", focus on getting the job done first before trying to speed up or cover all edge cases. in data work, instead of dealing with massive datasets and cluster, understand the problem well\n7. don't repeat yourself (DRY): when functions get copied and pasted all over, it's a problem. for DS, that means refactoring notebook code -> \"real\" modules\n8. composability: unix philosophy, \"write programs that can communicate easily with other programs\" so that developers break down projects into small simple programs rather than overly complex monolithic programs. instead of packing everything into one function, separate functions that read data, assemble data, and graph the result\n9. test the critical bits: simple basic tests and sanity checks are important for data projects, they prevent the most common errors and increase confidence about correctness\n10. fail fast and loudly: adopt a defensive way of thinking about error cases and focus on bailing out early if unanticipated errors happen\n",

    "content": "\n![Bal du moulin de la Galette, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1876](/images/lemoulin.jpg)\n\nif you were ever wondering [why you're not popular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPzNesJpthY).\n\nhere's Dr. Ana to answer that burning question.\n\nThe main trait of popular kids is they're **fun**\n\nBut what does it mean to be fun?\n\nThere are a few characteristics.\n\nfirst is **humor**. We like to laugh, and we like people who can make us laugh. laughing induces pleasant emotions. humor is a defense mechanism to keep people from experiencing the hardships of life as painfully as they would. That's we like comedians. so if you're innately funny, let that shine in social interactions.\n\nsecond is **charisma**. Charisma is comprised of three components: presence, warmth and power. if you can make people feel like the most important person in the room (presence), and they have positive feelings towards you (warmth) and you are somebody worth being around (power), then you're fun to be around.\n\nthird is a **good conversationalist**. what makes conversations free flow and fun? it's not the deep questions, some people don't like to go too deep and intimate into their traumas or personal lives, especially if they don't know you that well yet. Instead, have surface level conversations that can involve humor, then go deeper\n\nexample, you're talking to a therapist\n\n- you ask: \"what is it like to be a therapist, do you feel drained at the end of the day?\", they share their experience, talk about their day, and you just nod, and try to think of the next question and there's no flow\n- you say: \"I always wanted to be a therapist in undergrad but I decided against\" they asked why, you say \"I don't think I had enough empathy for it\", you both laugh, they ask \"what did you go into instead?\", and conversation flows from there\n\nfourth is **liveliness**. they exude energy, they dance enthusiastically, they converse enthusiastically, they are very uninhibited, they laugh wholeheartedly. they're the ones pulling people on to the dance floor. naturally you'll be drawn to high energy people because they will pull us up, whereas low energy people are going to be a little bit more static. Extroverts have the advantage here, whereas introverts are the people who retreat from loud environments. Introverts might be grounding for people, creating a calm and pleasant environment, but that isn't fun. So, if you're an introvert, you have to put in more effort to be lively and recharge your [social battery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lilEWBmxTXI).\n\nlast is **risk taker**. fun people are not as reactive when something scary happens, their bodies are not as affected in dangerous situations, the seek the adrenaline rush. They're the ones that have fun with life and don't mind things getting a little dangerous. They don't think, they act. They're the ones that convinces everyone to go out when everyone's already in bed, the ones that takes the first dive at a cliff, the ones that tell you to ask out that person at the bar. learn to live a little, you do only live once. but don't be too reckless.\n\none thing to take mind is, greater popularity does not relate to being a good person or a good friend, it's just about being fun.\n\nif you want to be popular, ask yourself in every single interaction, how can I make this more fun for the other person?\n",

Your energy is a limited resource that you're consciously or unconsciously investing every day.\n2. How you invest that energy determines the outcome of your life.\n3. Most people will convince you to invest your energy into things that benefit them, not you.\n4. You will never have as much disposable energy as you do in your 20s ever again\n\nSo the [the biggest mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If4PiQMb5Sg) 20 year olds can make is chasing pleasure and comfort, and not investing energy into building a strong foundation for their lives.\n\nIf you become disciplined and sow the right seeds early, you'll reap an abundance of health, wealth, intelligence, love and strength in the future.\n\nBut how do you become disciplined?\n\nYou need to know these two concepts: compound interest and purchasing power\n\nCompound interest is what turns small investments into huge payouts over time, it's the only sure way to generate wealth in any domain.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n> Jill invests \\$5,000 a year in an asset that increases by 7% in value each year, while Jack invests in an asset that decreases by 7% in value each year. After ten years of investing, Jill has about \\$69,000 in her account, but Jack only has around $37,000\n\nApplying this to habits, the same logic applies.\n\nIf you invest in good habits early, they will compound and accelerate your growth through the power of compound interest\n\nAs James Clear once said: \"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement\"\n\nThe second piece is purchasing power.\n\nBack to the financial metaphor:\n\n> Imagine now that instead of having \\$5,000 to invest each year into an asset, Jack and Jill lose \\$200 worth of purchasing power each year\n\nThe amount of energy available you have to invest in yourself declines as you get older.\n\nAs you get older, you take on more responsibilities that place a demand on your energy. You have to manage your time and energy to balance work, family, and self-care.\n\nThe easiest time to form good habits and break bad ones is while you're younger.\n\nTo make things easy, you can focus on only 5 assets to invest in.\n\n## Five best assets to invest in\n\n1. productive capital\n   - what: your expertise that makes you valuable to society\n   - how: stay curious, consistently learn and improve, do hard things, put in the work\n2. spiritual capital\n   - what: how strong your conscience is in making wise decisions\n   - how: self-reflect, meditate, be truthful and honest, volunteer and mentor, support local causes\n3. intellectual capital\n   - what: ability to turn negative emotions into insights and actions\n   - how: practice labeling emotions, use creative outlets to process emotions\n4. social capital\n   - what: depth and quality of relationships\n   - how: invest in quality time with friends and family, seek for mentors, network and step out of comfort zone\n5. physical capital\n   - what: health and physical well-being\n   - how: consistent exercise routine, balanced nutrition, staying hydrated, quality sleep and rest\n\nLook at your daily/weekly/monthly schedule, try to squeeze in time to grow and develop each of the five forms of capital.\n\nThis way you're investing time and energy that will have ROI in the long run.\n",

Set people straight if you can. If not just repair the damage. And suppose you can't do that either, then where does blaming people get you?\n   - blaming others is counterproductive and just leads to arguments on who is at fault, rather than focusing on how to fix the issue\n   - MLK framed racism as justice vs injustice rather than blaming all white people\n2. don't second guess, act with conviction\n   > Concentrate every minute on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness. Free yourself from all other distractions. Stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you\n   - once you've made your decision after careful thought, don't think, just do\n   - overanalyzing leads to \"paralysis by analysis\", like the centipede who forgot how to walk\n3. find the beauty in your mistakes\n   > If anyone can refute me, show me I'm making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective, I'll gladly change. It's the truth I'm after, and the truth never harmed anyone\n   - mistakes are inevitable, see them as lessons and opportunities to grow\n   - art of Kintsugi, cracks repaired with beauty by filling with gold/silver\n4. humble yourself, pride = cowardice\n   > Remember, matter. How tiny your share of it. Time, how brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate, how small a role you play in it.\n   - humility allows you to make mistakes without ego getting in the way of courage\n   - Emperor's new clothes shows his pride which underlie cowardice\n5. do your best and trust that things will work out\n   > He does only what is his to do and considers constantly what the world has in store for him, doing his best and trusting that all is for the best. For we carry our fate with us and it carries us\n   - lean into uncertainty, have faith that things will turn out as they should\n   - Howard Schultz saving Starbucks by his belief that things will turn out good\n",

    "content": "\nwas watching [this part](https://youtu.be/WfzW2pXUXV0?si=_iuA0mH7q9CGptWd&t=1446) in Kevin Rose's podcast episode with Charles Duhigg where he talks about how to gracefully end conversations.\n\nSay something along the lines of,\n\n> I totally apologize, I have to go talk to my friend / head to the bathroom / leave home, but before I do, I just have one more question for you.\n\nI realize I've been doing this when I have coffee chats with people online.\n\nI forgot where I heard this advice from, but I've never applied it in real life.\n\nI usually stick to one person to chat with, since I don't have anyone else to talk to at the moment, so this never comes up.\n\nI like to perform depth-first instead of breadth-first socializing.\n\nI remember at the airflow event in Toronto I basically talked to this snapchat guy the entire time, which wasn't a bad thing, I learned a lot more about him and his life. But I wish I talked to more people. There was this other open-source guy, but it was just me asking him questions the whole time. The conversation was dry and painfully awkward towards the end that I just had to just slowly remove myself from their circle. It was uncomfortable, but it taught me what to avoid the next time.\n\nI have a lot to learn on how to swiftly and confidently say thank you for the chat, and move on to the next person to talk to. All this gets easier with experience. I haven't been to these kinds of events since Toronto and I'm excited to go back. Communication skills are the bedrock of everything. And one I aim to harness and become pretty good at, by the time I graduate.\n",

    "content": "\n![Paul Signac, The Harbour at Marseilles (1906)](/images/harbourmarseilles.jpeg)\n\nI came across this Feynman quote on FS's [Brain Food newsletter](https://fs.blog/newsletter/).\n\n> \"Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do.\"\n\nIt's comforting to read this advice when I'm currently feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about my future. I'm doing a masters in data science program and I don't even like data science, or at least, the idea of it.\n\nI have the dream of working in FAANG, or at least I saw other people did, and I wanted it too. The perks, the people, the status, how can I not aim for that? who could say no?\n\nI always thought about who to become, a data scientist or engineer in a big tech company, but I don't think enough about what I want to do. And that's such a hard question for me to figure out.\n\nEver since college I feel like I've just been writing a bunch of low-quality articles which are just quick tutorials or brief explainers or listicles, doing lots of hackathons and learning web-dev, self-studying a bit of ML before losing interest, forcing myself to study statistics to graduate, consuming a bunch of information through blogs, podcasts, videos, and now recently, having an interest in art, and I feel like I don't know anything, and I'm not good enough to make it in the US.\n\nI feel like I know a bit about a lot of things, but I'm still not an expert in anything. I don't have one thing that I'm really good at. I can learn fast, and I pick things up quick, but I don't know which road to take, which opportunity cost to forego, which doors to open and close.\n\nBut to think about what I like doing,\n\nI like figuring things out, and I like doing research and going deep into rabbit holes, and then turn that information into something useful, like writing articles and provide value for people. I also like building things. I discovered this love after doing over a dozen hackathons. My dream is to build cool apps that I personally would want to use but that flame went out a week before my surgery in March, and after a few dizzy months I don't have the time to pick it back up now. I want to build something useful that provide joy to people.\n\nCurrently, I hope to work on the intersection of data, AI, climate, and on the side, building a startup and apps that provide joy and value.\n\nSome more quotes by Feynman which I enjoy:\n\n> You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.\n\n> The highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion.\n>\n> Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.\n",

It is a great pleasure for me.\n>\n> – Paul Gauguin\n\n> I think that nothing is more difficult for a true painter than to paint a rose, since before he can do so, he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted.\n>\n> – Henri Matisse\n\n> (A) painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers or even clouds.\n>\n> – Édouard Manet\n\n> I am working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers fade so soon, and the thing is to do the whole in one rush.\n>\n> – Vincent van Gogh\n\n> Never have I had more ideas about Art in my head, and yet I am forced to do flowers. While painting them—standing before the peonies and roses—I think of Michelangelo. This cannot go on.\n>\n> – Henri Fantin-Latour\n\n> It relaxes my mind to paint flowers. I do not bring to it the same tension of spirit as when I am in front of a model. When I paint flowers, I arrange the tones, I try out different values boldly, without worrying about wasting a canvas.\n>\n> What seems to me to be one of the most important things about our movement is that we have freed painting from the tyranny of subject-matter. I am free to paint flowers and call them flowers, without having to weave a story round them.\n>\n> – Pierre-Auguste Renoir\n",

And there are AI writing tools for research that helps you search papers, chat with papers, and write and cite papers for you, and you can add your own knowledge too.\n\nWhat I want is something that exist in that mix of tools. Let's say I'm diving into the rabbit hole of climate change, specifically in how AI can be used to [transform the energy network](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/22/1083792/ai-power-grid-improvement/), and I found 10 great articles talking about that.\n\nIt's either I save these articles in another platform, and exa.ai can source even more related articles, I select the ones I want, and I can start a chat. And ideally this chat will continue to help me discover more related sources, and help me build a map of knowledge around that topic. And it should be something I can come back to and revisit.\n\nOr it would be cooler if Arc eventually let's you chat with multiple tabs (it only supports a single website currently by pressing CMD+F), where you put all articles in a bookmark group, and you can begin a conversation.\n\nAnyways, I coded a basic solution by just extracting the text from each blog using [Trafilatura](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and then passing it all in an API call.\n\nthis is my prompt:\n\n> You have been provided with a set of articles.

I'm realizing that soon, when I wake up, it won't be in this house that I grew up in, with my family around me.\n- I laid in bed for an hour on my phone again, it's such a hard habit to break. Future me is suffering the consequences of current me wasting all that time being comfortable.\n- decided to finish up my sketch while having breakfast and it took me almost 2 hours. perfectionism is a curse. I also thought it was June for some reason.\n- my mom and sister actually have good eye and can tell what is good/bad and what needs correction. everyone is an artist.\n- being able to sketch on a Monday morning without any pressure or responsibilities (that is external and high stakes) is such a blessing and one that I strive for in my future life\n- I kept context switching in hopes of finishing everything but I end up only doing 10-20% in each thing. Not sure if going all in on just one thing is good too. I was exploring different ideas and brainstorming.\n- I've been ruminating over the same thing, playing movies in my head, for the past few weeks when I should just write things down, it would help me so much but I just don't do it.\n- I have a feeling that the heat and humidity is a large factor for my headaches and dizziness. Because I realized I never was like this back in Ames. Something happened since I came back, well a lot of things happened, but I hope going back to SF means I'm more energized and productive.\n- had a walk with my sister around the flats and saw how life would be if I didn't have a hard-working dad who spent his entire life supporting us and making sure we'll have a good future. living in a bubble is the surest way to feel ungrateful and be seeking for more.\n- monkey bars are so hard, I heard my arms crack, but I actually did it after 3 tries. I'm so old.\n- after my surgery I feel more afraid of undoing the wrap, and shortening the 5-10 year cure that I was given. I'm always testing my limits but I'm worried about pushing too hard, which sucks as a 20 something year old.\n- I watched a cat poop in amazement like I'm an alien, and I found it funny and slightly concerning that I'm going crazy\n- been feeling like a failure lately from browsing twitter, more dejecting than inspiring, could be a mindset issue\n- been worrying that I won't be as ambitious or smart or talented to fit in with the SF crowd\n- I've been craving kimchi in my meals and I'm so glad I get to eat it.\n- this week feels really overwhelming with the launch and the kaggle assignment, and trip planning and articles to finish. but busy is good. I should start picking up the pace to prep myself for my masters.\n",

I know that there are two modes of experience: appreciative, and evaluative. Concrete example: let’s say you’re listening to a piece of music. Are you sinking into it, awash in emotions? You’re in the appreciative mode. Are you the mixing engineer, listening to the snare hits to make sure they’re consistent? You’re in the evaluative mode. Much of sanity, and happiness, consists of finding the right mode for the right moment. The appreciative mode is terrible for debugging your business plan. But the evaluative mode is terrible for having a first date. A lot of capable, intelligent people suffer because they do not have the ability to switch out of the evaluative mode, or even notice that they’re in it.\n\nI kept thinking about this during worship at church. For some reason, when I'm on the floor with the audience, I can never put myself in the appreciative mode, sinking into the worship mode and praising God. I keep evaluating how the pianist is playing, and whether I can pick up their unique style and flair to use myself, whether the singers are on key, whether the entire band is on-tempo, and how it the worship sounds overall, constantly evaluating, unable to switch it off.\n\nIn many other situations in my life, I can't think of many moments when I was fully in the appreciative mode. Hopefully after knowing this, I would do a pulse check to notice whether I'm stuck in the evaluating mode, and be able to just appreciate things.\n",

    "content": "\nThere's a Kaggle competition that I'm working on with a grandmaster.\n\nIt's called [Leash Bio - Predict New Medicines with BELKA](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA/data?select=train.parquet)\n\nMore specifically, the goal is to predict small molecule-protein interactions using the Big Encoded Library for Chemical Assessment (BELKA)\n\nBack to basics of biology.\n\n### what are proteins?\n\nthey are large, complex molecules made up of smaller units of chains called amino acids. These chains fold into 3d structures, and the specific structure determines the function of the protein.\n\n### what are they used for?\n\nvirtually every process that takes place in living organisms.\n\nthey can act as\n\n- enzymes: catalyzing chemical reactions\n- structural: provide support and shape to cells and tissue\n- signalling molecules: transmitting information within and between cells\n- transporters: move molecules across cell membranes\n\nNow what does this have to do with drugs?\n\n### drugs & proteins\n\ndrugs are small molecules designed to bind to specific and either inhibit or activate their functions.\n\nThey act like a lock and key, where the small molecule (the key) fits into a specific pocket or binding site on the protein (the lock). When this binding occurs, it can alter the protein's shape or behaviour, potentially treating a disease or condition caused by the abnormal activity of the protein.\n\ntake cancer for an example. a tumor is caused my cells that grow uncontrollably, and if there's a drug that can inhibit this protein and stop the growth, it can be used to treat cancer.\n\nNow back to the competition.\n\n### the goal\n\nThe goal is to develop an ML model to predict whether a given small molecule will bind to one of three specific protein targets.\n\n1. EPHX2 (soluble epoxide hydrolase): This enzyme is involved in regulating blood pressure and diabetes progression.\n1. BRD4 (bromodomain-containing protein 4): This protein plays a role in gene expression and is implicated in cancer progression. Drugs that inhibit BRD4 could be used as cancer treatments.\n1. ALB (human serum albumin): This is the most abundant protein in blood and is responsible for transporting various molecules, including drugs. Predicting how small molecules bind to ALB can help in designing drugs that are not sequestered by this protein, improving their efficacy.\n\nFor any AI task, the data is everything.\n\n### the data\n\nThe dataset is 133 million small molecules, each represented by a [SMILES](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html) string, which stands for (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) and is a way to encode the structure of chemical molecules as a linear string of characters. For example, the SMILES string \"C1=CC=C(C=C1)C\" represents the molecule benzene.\n\nEach small molecule is composed of three \"building blocks\" and a central triazine core.\n\nThink of the triazine core as the glue, a framework for how the three blocks are attached\n\n### representing molecules\n\nThere are different ways of [representing](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00460-5) molecules. They are provided as SMILES in the data, but you can explore\n\n- [Graphs](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcms.1603)\n- [3d structures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10689004/)\n- [Spherical CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10130)\n\n### how is this data collected?\n\nUsing [DNA-encoded libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA-encoded_chemical_library?useskin=vector) (DELs)\n\nBefore DELs, small molecules had to be kept in separate, identifiable tubes and required a lot of liquid handling to test each one of them against the protein target of interest in a separate reaction. This logistical overhead limited the screening collections (libraries) to 50K-5m small molecules.\n\nIn 2009, as DNA sequencing got [cheaper and cheaper](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost), they realized they can use DNA itself as a label to identify collections of molecules in a complex mixture.\n\nSo now scientists can fit in many small molecules in a single tube, each of them barcoded using DNA sequencing technology, and exposed to the protein target of interest in solution. Then, the protein target of interest is rinsed to remove the molecules that do not bind to the target, and the remaining binders are collected and DNA sequenced.\n\nAn intuitive way to think of DELs is imagine a Mickey mouse head as a small molecule in the DEL. And we attach a DNA barcode to its chin. And its left ear is attached with a velcro and the right ear with a zipper. The zipper and velcro are analogies to different chemical reactions to construct the DEL.\n\nSay we buy 10 different faces, 10 different zipper ears and 10 different velcro ears to construct our library. By creating every possible combination of the three, we have 1000 small molecules, while only needing 30 building blocks (faces and ears). This combinatorial approach is what allows a DEL to have so many members, and how the 133M small molecules in the dataset is constructed.\n\n### Why is this model important?\n\nThe classic approach to identify the right molecules is to physically make them one by one, and then expose them to the protein target of interest and test if the two interact. This is a time-intensive and laborious process.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only ~[2000](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/new-drugs-fda-cders-new-molecular-entities-and-new-therapeutic-biological-products) novel molecular entities in its entire history. But the number of chemicals in druglike space has been estimated to be [10^60](https://www.nature.com/articles/432823a), and the next treatment of cancer could be hiding in this chemical space, but it would be impossible to physically search it.\n\nThat's why we need ML to accelerate drug discovery.\n\nWith this model, researches can input various small molecules into the model, and predict their binding affinities to specific protein targets. This helps prioritize which small molecules are most promising for further testing and development as potential drug candidates.\n\n###\\*\\*\\*\\* example use cases\n\n1. improve drug delivery and efficacy\n   - say you have a new promising drug but a significant portion of it is being sequestered by serum albumin (ALB protein target) in the bloodstream, reducing its effectiveness.\n   - using ML, you can identify modifications to the drug's structure to reduce its binding affinity for ALB, improving its delivery\n2. repurpose existing drugs\n   - taking advantage of the binding interactions of existing drugs to treat other conditions\n   - using ML to identify potential repurposing opportunities\n\n###\\*\\*\\*\\* solutions\n\ncoming soon...\n",

The neurotic, the saint are engaged in the same battle. Their blood flows from similar wounds. But the first one gasps and the other one gives.\" — Georges Bataille\n\nAfter learning more about [neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism?useskin=vector) today, I believe I'm someone who scores high on neuroticism.\n\nIn an effort to learn more about this condition, and how to cope with it, I'm reading a few articles and taking some notes as I go.\n\n## what it is\n\n- a personality trait, not a mental health condition\n- prone to easily aroused, sometimes uncontrollable, negative emotions that don't interfere with daily function\n- one of the \"Big Five\" personality traits in psychological development theory, originally outlined in 1949 by D.W. Fiske\n\n## questions\n\n- Do you suffer from \"nerves\"?\n- Do you worry too long after an embarrassing experience?\n- Are your feelings easily hurt?\n- Are you often troubled by feelings of guilt?\n- Are you an irritable person?\n\n## symptoms\n\n- a natural inclination for negative emotions (anger, anxiety, sadness, depression, self-doubt, jealousy, etc.)\n- easy emotional stimulation\n- persistent worrying or ruminating\n- finding it challenging to manage emotions in the moment\n- experiencing major shifts in emotions\n- feeling unable to cope with or overcome challenges\n- regular tendency to have excessive reactions to minor scenarios\n- persistent worrying\n\n## advantages\n\n- greater creativity: a neurotic's worries comes from an overactive imagination, like a cinema screen in your head playing different possibilities, allowing you to consider different choices and actions.\n  - at worst, this contributes to unhappy rumination, but also deeper thinking and more original ideas. this is an advantage compared with someone who never thinks about problems\n  - ex: Isaac Newton, known to have be melancholic and ruminative, he would repeatedly brood over the scientific questions that were troubling him and eventually crack them months or years later\n\n## strategies\n\n- reframe \"negative\" -> \"difficult\"\n- develop emotional granularity: learn how to describe your emotional state with complexity, it helps you clearly behold an emotion and suggests an action\n- seek adventure: develop a discipline fo risk-taking, forcing yourself to do things you wouldn't do and make that a regular part of your life. \"The opposite of anxiety is exploration\"\n- put it into words\n- self-distancing: looking at a problem from an outside perspective, imagine you are advising a friend who is facing the same issue.\n- acceptance and reappraisal: look at your worries and anxieties dispassionately. question whether your thoughts have good factual basis, conveys useful information that you can act on, and whether there could be a more positive interpretation of an event.\n\n## references\n\n- [Neuroticism - an overview | ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/neuroticism)\n- [Neuroticism: What It Means, Signs, and Tips to Cope](https://psychcentral.com/health/all-about-neuroticism)\n- [Don’t fret, neurotics – there are advantages to worrying | Psychology | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/16/dont-fret-neurotics-there-are-advantages-to-worrying)\n- [5 Ways to Turn Neuroticism to Your Advantage | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychiatry-the-people/201803/5-ways-turn-neuroticism-your-advantage)\\\n- [How to deal with negative emotions -- Science of Us](https://www.thecut.com/2016/11/how-to-deal-with-negative-emotions.html)\n",

Relax when you're not.\n- Your time is $1000/hour, respect your time and act accordingly\n- Stop multi-tasking, it only kills your focus\n- Set up a work routine and stick to it, your body will adapt\n- Time block: You're more focused and productive with limited time\n- Work is the best way to get working. Start with short and small tasks.\n- Work iteratively. don't expect to do things perfectly\n  > \"Doing is better than perfect\" – Facebook motto\n- More work hours != more productivity.\n- Separate brainless and strategic tasks\n  > \"Separate thinking and execution to execute faster and think better\" – Sol Tanguay\n- Put important meetings early in the day so you can focus on other work after\n- Group meetings and communication (email or phone) to create blocks of uninterrupted work\n- Avoid context switching: keep the same context throughout the day.\n- Work around procrastination. Procrastinate between sprints of work (Pomodoro)\n- break things down\n  > Break the unreasonable down into little reasonable chunks. A big goal is only achieved when every little thing that you do everyday, gets you closer to that goal – Maren Kate, Escaping the 9 to 5\n- Always prioritize: No 2 task holds the same importance. sort/group your to-do list by importance\n- Always know the **one thing** you need to get done during the day that has the biggest impact\n- Break tasks into hour increments. Long tasks are hard to get into.\n- Delegate and learn to make use of other people.\n  > \"If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate!\" – John C. Maxwell\n- Only think about today and tomorrow.\n  > \"Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games\" – Babe Ruth\n- Set deadlines for everything. Don't let tasks run indefinitely.\n- Set end dates for intense or stressful activities\n- Always take notes and set reminders. Your brain is fallible and your memory cannot be trusted\n- Write down anything that distracts you – random thoughts, new ideas, emotions. Once you write them down, they'll stop bothering you when you try to focus\n- Take breaks. Sometimes.\n",

If manager's expectations are high, productivity is likely to be excellent. If their expectations are low, productivity is likely to be poor. It is as though there were a law that caused subordinates' performance to rise or fall to meet managers' expectations.\"\n>\n> – Pygmalion in Management, J. Sterling Livingston\n\n- our reality is negotiable and can be manipulated by others, on purpose or by accident\n- <mark>What we achieve, how we think, how we act, and how we perceive our capabilities can be influenced by the expectations of those around us.</mark>\n\n> \"The visions we offer our children shape the future. It matters what those visions are. Often they become self-fulfilling prophecies. Dreams are maps.\" — Carl Sagan\n\n- check your assumptions (especially the negative ones), actively fight against stereotypes and prejudice, they influence your behaviour and expectations of others that might affect their lives.\n- be mindful of the potential influence of our expectations\n- high expectations = inspire others to perform at their best\n  - <mark>people's limitations are stretched if you change your perception of their limitations</mark>\n- if you want people around you to succeed, raise your expectations; if you expect the worst, you'll probably get it.\n\n> Roy T.

    "content": "\nI'm currently building an app with my friend and we want to turn it into a startup.\n\nWe're making something we want for ourselves, and we hope it's something people want to, echoing what YC says, \"Don't make a startup, make something people want\".\n\nI found this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34908337) [Intercom on Starting Up](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/intercom-starting-up) by Des Traynor on Twitter a few days ago, and decided to read a few pages since my internet was down at the club.\n\nI'm focused on 3 questions out of the 9 in the book because it's more relevant for me right now as I'm building an MVP with a friend.\n\nThe questions are: what to build, how to build it, and how to find your first customer.\n\n---\n\n## What will you build?\n\nNote: This question is not one you can answer definitively. Even after releasing and getting users, you have to continue making hard decisions about what features to build next, what bugs to fix, what customer request to address.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions before you start designing or coding\n\n1. Is this a **real problem** people want solved?\n2. Do I have **experience** with this problem that will help solve it?\n3. Can I build something that's **magical**, and is substantially better than existing products?\n\n### \"Problems first, Technology second.\"\n\n- One of the biggest mistake is focusing on the technology, rather than what it will enable.\n- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework\n  - **what?** people don't buy your product because of their demographic, they want to hire it to do a job for them\n  - All technology flops have something in common. They failed to do a job for their customers.\n\n### Innovation has [two components](https://experiencinginformation.com/2012/06/03/clarifying-innovation-four-zones-of-innovation/)\n\ntechnological innovation and market impact\n\n- Breakthrough Tech = high technology progress + low market impact\n- **Disruptive** = high market impact + low technology progress\n  - Truly disruptive products don't require a huge technological leap, they just have a much better understanding of what the jobs to be done are.\n- Game Changers = high tech + high market\n  - ex: the iPhone, focused on real things people needed to do and showed how they were possible in infinitely superior ways.\n  - are first movers, often fail because they don't know how to explain what they've built. make sure to clearly articulate the problems your product solves.\n\n### Anticipate but don't fetishize the future\n\n> \"Any degree of success will breed complacency. Any degree of complacency will breed failure. Therefore only the paranoid survive.\"\n> – Intel CEO Andy Grove\n\n- be acutely aware of all the different technological shifts happening, constantly ask how these things will affect you.\n- focus on the technological landscape around you and what's coming down the line\n- pay less attention to homepage of TechCrunch, and more to the changes happening in the industry you're in\n- Ask yourself: Does this tech make it cheaper, faster or easier for our customers to make progress in their lives?\n\n### Don't reinvent the wheel\n\n- great products can be created by tinkering and improving on existing ideas, or making unglamorous changes that don't require new tech\n- double down on what already works, and focus on the first step where you can add value.\n- if you've tried and tested ideas that work, build on them. Customers aren't paying for innovation, they're paying for a great product experience\n\n### Three ways software feels magical\n\n> great product design is about cost-benefit analysis. How much does the user have to do versus the benefit they get in return? Whenever you find a way to dramatically reduce the cost – time and money – to the user and provide a greater benefit, you're creating something magical\n\n1. Era of Uber-ification\n   - Uber-ification = the slimming down of application interfaces into push-button experiences that do one thing. The next consumerization.\n   - one tap or swipe gets you a date, food, a movie, flowers, a job, even a dog.\n   - The user's context – time, location, device, previous actions – combined with behavioral analytics and user preferences, can all be combined to offer a simple way to do complex tasks.\n2. End of data entry\n   - baseline: shift from recall to recognition, rather than asking users to recall and enter items, let them pick from options\n   - real magic: no steps. connect to socials to find my friends, connect to email to find receipts and meetings, connect to bank to analyze transactions.\n3. Ambient awareness\n   - great software relies on ambient awareness – it conveys information without you looking directly at it.\n   - ask yourself \"How can I ensure that every user gets value from this product, even if they forget to log in?\"\n   - this can be push notifications, newsletters, SMS, daily reports for users to get full value of your product.\n\n## How will you build it?\n\n### Core principles on building a product\n\nby Paul Adams, VP of Product\n\n- Ruthless focus on the exact problem you're trying to solve\n  - talk to customers and research their problems, perceptions, wants and needs.\n  - PMs must be directly connected to customers.\n- Obsess about the smallest thing we can build that we think will solve the problem\n  - think big, but scope right back to the absolute minimum.\n  - this is a painful process, bu this pain means you're remaining focused\n- Ship to learn\n  - shipping is only the beginning of building, ship as fast and frequently as you can\n  - don't rune experiments, startups that fall back to experiments to make product decisions aren't focusing enough on the problem they're solving\n  - shipping to learn = being confident that you've understood and solved the problem, but humble enough to know you'll only truly learn when it's in the hands of customers.\n  - the best product people are obsessively curious after they ship something. they _need_ to know if what they designed and built helped their customers\n\n### Guidelines for making decisions\n\n- many small steps > bigger launches\n  - ship the smallest, simplest thing that will get you closest to your objective as fast as possible and help you learn what works.\n- daily and weekly goals\n  - everyone should know what their goals are for each day, how they relate to the team's weekly goals, and how they relate to what is being released by the company.\n- optimize for face-to-face collabs\n  - two people at a whiteboard = more ideas and reach consensus quicker, remote work is not for speed and efficiency of decision making.\n- fight against \"work work\"\n  - don't use software to build software, fight anything beyond a lightweight process, use the fewest number of software tools to get the job done\n- outcome > plan\n  - plans are made with limited information, but things only become fully clear as you execute\n  - best teams absorb and react to new info and build great products in spite of changing circumstances.\n\n### accountability & goals\n\n- it must be crystal clear who is accountable for what\n- if it's design: it's on the designer (ensure they understand the research and problem being addressed)\n- if it's bugs, it's on the PM (ensure they test realistic usage and edge cases)\n\nA culture of goal setting\n\n- set weekly and daily goals to stay focused and on track\n- break weekly goals into daily and sub-daily goals to reinforce the idea that every day counts and the **cadence of building** matters\n\n### A product roadmap\n\n- next 6 years\n  - picture of the world in six years, and how it will evolve as you make changes\n- next 6 months\n  - you should be thinking \"we're making great progress\"\n  - about 50-70% of the things on the list might be built, the other 25% are things you hadn't thought of before\n- next 6 weeks\n  - immediate plan and what your team intimately understands\n  - you know exactly what's being built\n  - updated every week or two\n\n### Anatomy of a product roadmap\n\n1. new ideas\n   - based on opinion rather than research, not data-driven\n   - comes from the trends and ideas you see and what excites you the most\n2. iterate recently shipped features\n   - you never get it right the first time no matter how hard you try or how much research you do\n   - shipping is just the beginning, iterate and make things better\n   - know your success criteria (metrics) before shipping, measure post launch and follow up with customers for qualitative feedback\n3. most common customer problems\n   - every week: tag every conversation with customers with a category (i.e. usability issue, feature, request, bug) and tag the team that owns that area\n   - every few months, create a \"hit list\" of most common customer problems\n   - use PMs weekly pulse and researchers' analysis to determine which problems to address first.\n4. improve quality\n   - two measures for grading issues\n     - how server is the problem\n     - how many customers does it affect\n   - fiercely commit to a high bar for speed, latency and efficiency.\n5. features to help you scale\n   - never build a feature to close a deal – this signals the beginning of the end of your product\n   - talk to sales team to research new customers and understand the types of features they're looking for\n\n### Three principles for shipping\n\n1. be comfortable knowing new features aren't perfect\n   - You can't become good at something without the freedom to be bad at it first.\n   - ship things that aren't \"perfect\", deliberately chose what not to build to accelerate production\n2. carefully define self-contained, well-scoped projects\n   - self-contained = engineers can get right to building without understanding the entire codebase\n   - well-scoped = able to ship something within a week\n   - paint the bigger picture, break it down into lots of smaller pieces that ship bit by bit, gradually replace parts of the experience.\n3. shipping is about learning\n   > The quicker you can get feedback on what you're thinking, the better your idea will be. Usage is oxygen for ideas. – DES (CO-FOUNDER)\n   - you can't predict how users wil behave or react. You give them a basic feature set, observe, and then iterate quickly.\n   - you will be wrong more often than being right, prioritize speed to execution\n\n## How will you find your first customers?\n\n- Intercom planted many seeds that led up to their launch, they wrote a ton of articles that appealed to the right audience. **They built their own social proof**. They also went #1 on Hackernews.\n- the startup [curve](https://yourstory.com/mystory/d90c9e8f6b-the-startup-curve-journey-of-an-entrepreneur): any company can get a one-day bump from TechCrunch and quickly end up in the \"trough of sorrow\" once the novelty wears off\n\n### \"we don't sell saddles here\"\n\n- Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield's famous internal memo on clearly articulating the vision behind the product\n- ex: if you're building a new email app, people don't care about pixels or shadows or fancy sidebars, they care about the **thinking behind the product**: how you think about email and how those ideas are reflected in the product\n- to attract a meaningful audience, <mark>share the ideas at the core of your product as early as you can</mark>. That's what attracts the people who are interested in the ideas and purpose underpinning your product.\n\n### word of mouth\n\n- the most powerful way of getting customers\n- you're more likely to try an app that a friend tells you over coffee than one you see in an ad\n- it's hard to put a price on its value\n- only useful when the same words come out of lots of different mouths\n\n### great messaging\n\nblind men and elephant analogy: when people first encounter your product, they will have different opinions of what it does and how it should be used. So it's important to have important messaging so they can easily explain your product.\n\n1. simple: easily understood by current and prospective customers\n1. compelling: describes something interesting or desirable to them\n1. specific: captures what your product does, not overly abstract\n1. differentiated: includes something that makes it unique\n1. defensible: not easy for competitors to copy\n\n> \"If you don't have your story and messaging right, no amount of money spent on tactics like paid acquisition will work. You'll bring people to your product only to find a message that doesn't resonate. Getting your story straight is crucial to convincing them your product is going to meet their needs.\"\n> – MATT (FIRST MARKETING HIRE)\n",

You accept that <mark>in choosing who you spend time with you choose who you are.</mark>\n1. Almost everyone who’s unhappy is unhappy because they feel isolated. The best cure for isolation is a **strong friend group**. So much of happiness is having someone you can get a last-minute dinner with on a Monday night, or ask to water your plants while you’re gone for a week. The opposite of loneliness, as it were.\n1. You try your best to **move to where your favorite people are**. You do not agonize over whether this is, in fact, The Best City in the World. You do not Complain Relentlessly about Everything You Dislike About It. You simply suck it up and accept that if you like the people around you, everything else will work out.\n1. You **ask your friends to live close to you**, though you accept that they might not want to. You say, Let’s all stay in California together. I want my kids to grow up with your kids.\n1. When you value friendships more, they also get more fraught. I think this is what Rhaina Cohen referred to as \"the problems of having community versus not having community.\" When we ask for more from friendship, we also get more disappointment, conflict, mismatch. <mark>There is no such thing as closeness without friction.</mark>\n1. Befriending people who are good communicators can make you a better communicator. Befriending people who are trustworthy makes you more trusting. **Secure attachment can be a learned thing**.\n1. People will have periods when they disappear; people have times when they let you down. When you know someone for many many years you will have so many ups and downs. <mark>As with any kind of love, the most important thing is that you both keep coming back</mark>.\n1. It’s okay to pursue and cherish romantic love, but <mark>sacrificing platonic love for it leads to disconnection and atomization</mark>.\n1. **You show up**: you go to your friends’ birthday parties. You ask them to read your writing. You make an effort to make nice with whoever they date.\n1. **Your friends will change you**, even in ways you initially reject. That’s a good thing. You will acquire new opinions and hobbies; you will find yourself into uncomfortable situations; you will learn to like the people they like.\n\nSome more quotes from her blog that resonated\n\nOn the friends she's made in SF\n\n> My friends are all pretty anti-authoritarian, willful, dogged, and cheerful—as B said, <mark>\"The type of people who believe they can fix the world’s problems through sheer force of will.\"</mark> I think my favorite thing about them is that they’re all very creative. In the literal sense that many of them write and make art, but also in the sense that they’re very good at solving problems in unorthodox ways.\n\n> The friends I met here were inventive, thoughtful, friendly and generous. They were nice to me without expecting anything back; they invited me to hikes, happy hours, house parties. They wanted to be helpful about work. They wanted to make the world better. At 19, they were so smart, and so impervious to irony. They were hopeful; why shouldn’t they be hopeful? They had built nuclear reactors in their basements, they had gotten perfect grades at MIT. 10 years later, my friends’ ambitions have both been realized and tempered. Many of them now either run or work happily at successful businesses; almost all of them have now lived through extreme work and personal life disappointments. They are doing what they want to do, and they have discovered that it is hard.\n\nOn meaning and work\n\n> My friends all believe that <mark>meaningful work was crucial to a good life</mark>. That was surprising to me when I first moved here. I wasn’t ambitious about work in the sense that I expected to be fulfilled; what mattered to me was survival, reassurance. Those were my parents’ values, and the values of the community I was raised in. Though I’m sure most of them were also hugely motivated by ego, validation, and financial success, I could also tell that they genuinely cared about liking what they did\n\npeople affect us a lot\n\n> \"romantic relationships/best friends/therapists are critical for the same reason, where this person can become <mark>the primary person who explains you to _you_, the supplement to your internal monologue, and can rewire your understanding of yourself for way better or for way worse.</mark>\n\nFriendship is a form of redemption\n\n> Like many women I’ve always loved Sex and the City, which is a show that is sometimes about sex, and sometimes about the city, but mostly about the friendship theory of everything. It’s about how it’s critical to have people in your life who love you and see you when you’re fun and sparkly and on top of the world, but also love you when you’re stagnant and petulant and self-sabotaging and letting them down. **It’s about how that kind of love makes you believe in other kinds of love**. It’s about how the essential texture of life is, yes, maybe a little in the shoes and a little in your apartment, but mostly about who you call to complain about a boy. And then they complain to you about their parents and then you tell them about the movie you want to see on Wednesday. It’s about how no one tells us that **friendship is a form of redemption** because even if work goes wrong and your boyfriend dumps you if you have people who believe you’re going to be okay you believe that you’re going to be okay.\n",

However, if the speaker gives the five required units of information, but is either too curt or long-winded in conveying them to the listener, then the maxim of manner is broken.\n>\n> The dividing line however, may be rather thin or unclear, and there are times when we may say that both the maxims of quantity and quality are broken by the same factors.\n",

Even when she swallows it whole she is only acting like any frightened mother cat eating its young to keep it safe\n\nthe delicate balance of intimacy and dependence\n\n> <mark>It is not easy to give closeness and freedom, safety plus danger.</mark>\n\nand the parental expectations that all of us live, well into adulthood.\n\n> No matter how old a mother is she watches her middle-aged children for signs of improvement. It could not be otherwise for she is impelled to know that the seeds of value sown in her have been winnowed. She never outgrows the burden of love, and to the end she carries the weight of hope for those she bore. Oddly, very oddly, she is forever surprised and even faintly wronged that her sons and daughters are just people, for <mark>many mothers hope and half expect that their newborn child will make the world better, will somehow be a redeemer</mark>. Perhaps they are right, and they can believe that the rare quality they glimpsed in the child is active in the burdened adult.\n\nAnd Mary Gaitskill, in _Take My Advice: Letters to the Next Generation from People Who Know a Thing or Two_, gives advice for [when your parents are dying](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/11/11/when-your-parents-are-dying-mary-gaitskill/):\n\n> My advice here is very specific and practicable. It is advice I wish someone had given me as forcefully as I’m about to give it now: **When your parents are dying, you should go be with them. You should spend as much time as you can. This may seem obvious; you would be surprised how difficult it can be**. It is less difficult if you have a good relationship with the parent or, even if you don’t, if you’re old enough to have lost friends and to have seriously considered your own death. Even so, it may be more difficult than you think.\n\nConcluding that we are not born alone:\n\n> They say that you come into the world alone and that you leave alone too. But <mark>you aren’t born alone; your mother is with you, maybe your father too</mark>. Their presence may have been loving, it may have been demented, it may have been both. But they were with you. When they are dying, remember that. And go be with them.\n\nAnd Psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott on [mother as a pillar of society](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/08/winnicott-mothers-contribution-to-society/).\n\nIn a piece titled \"The Mother’s Contribution to Society,\" from his book _Winnicott on the Child_, he writes:\n\n> It seems to me that there is something missing in human society. Children grow up and become in their turn fathers and mothers, but, on the whole, **they do not grow up to know and acknowledge just what their mothers did for them at the start.**\n>\n> Ordinary good parents do build a home and stick together, thus providing the basic ration of child care and thus maintaining a setting in which each child can gradually find the self and the world, and a working relationship between the two. But parents do not want gratitude for this; **they get their rewards, and rather than be thanked they prefer to see their children growing up and themselves becoming parents and home-builders**. This can be put the other way round. Boys and girls can legitimately blame parents when, after bringing about their existence, they do not furnish them with that start in life which is their due.\n\nthe overlooked value of the home to the welfare of society\n\n> We know something of the reasons why this long and exacting task, the parents’ job of seeing their children through, is a job worth doing; and, in fact, <mark>we believe that it provides the only real basis for society, and the only factory for the democratic tendency in a country’s social system</mark>. But the home is the parents’, not the child’s, responsibility.\n\nand the recognition of \"the immense contribution to the individual and to society\" the \"ordinary good mother\" makes simply by virtue of her devotion to the child.\n\n> Is not this contribution of the devoted mother unrecognized precisely because it is immense? If this contribution is accepted, it follows that <mark>every man or woman who is sane, every man or woman who has the feeling of being a person in the world, and for whom the world means something, every happy person, is in infinite debt to a woman.</mark>\n\nI'm also amazed by Edna St. Vincent Millay’s deep bond and rare relationship that she shared with her mother, who uses the terms \"dear\", \"dearest\", \"sweetheart\", and even \"my Best Beloved\" in her[beautiful letters](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/02/edna-st-vincent-millay-love-letter-mother/) that you can find in [The Letters of Edna St. Vincent Millay](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/452228).\n\n---\n\nSince this was about mothers, a few writings on raising children I want to save for future reading:\n\n- [On Children: Poignant Parenting Advice from Kahlil Gibran](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/09/09/on-children-kahlil-gibran/)\n- [How to Raise a Child: 10 Rules from Young Susan Sontag](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/09/13/susan-sontag-10-rules-for-raising-a-child/)\n- [Crescendo: A Watercolor Ode to the Science, Strangeness, and Splendor of Pregnancy](https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/03/20/crescendo-quintavalle-sanna/)\n",

Every passerby is my unconscious sitter; and as strange as it may seem, I really draw folk as I see them\"\n>\n> – Aubrey Beardsley, 1894\n\n> \"Reason informed by emotion - expressed in beauty - elevated by earnestness - lightened by humour - that is the ideal that should guide all artists.\"\n>\n> – Charles Rennie Mackintosh, 1902\n\n> \"To every age its art, to every art its freedom.\n>\n> – Motto above the door of the Secession Building, 1898\n\n> \"Simplicity lies not in omission, but in synthesis.\"\n>\n> – Koloman Moser, 1905\n\n> \"It is upon us architects that falls..the duty of determining, by our art, not only artistic, but also the civilising and scientific evolution of our time.\"\n>\n> – Hector Guimard, 1902\n\n> \"Only that which is practical can be beautiful\"\n>\n> – Otto Wagner, 1896\n\n> \"The aim of my work: the study of nature, the love of nature's art, and the need to express what one feels in one's heart.\"\n>\n> – Émile Gallé, 1884-89\n\n> \"Design is not about decorating functional forms - it is about creating forms that accord with the character of the object and that show new technologies to advantage.\"\n>\n> – Peter Behrens, ca. 1907\n\n> \"My lifelong quest has always been in pursuit of beauty.\"\n>\n> – Louis Comfort Tiffany, 1916\n\n> \"Art is the Flower.

Vatican Palace, Rome, 1509](/images/pythagoras.jpeg)\n\nBarbara Oakley shares how she rewired her brain to become [fluent in math](https://nautil.us/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-235085/).\n\nShe talks about how schools focus too much on understanding and not enough on repetition and fluency, that students have to grasp the fundamental essence of an idea, even though that can quickly slip away without practice to consolidate them.\n\n> Students who have been reared in elementary school and high school to believe that understanding math through active discussion is the talisman of learning. If you can explain what you’ve learned to others, perhaps drawing them a picture, the thinking goes, you must\n> understand it.\n>\n> Japan has become seen as a much-admired and emulated exemplar of these active, “understanding-centered” teaching methods. But what’s often missing from the discussion is the rest of the story: Japan is also home of the Kumon method of teaching mathematics, which emphasizes memorization, repetition, and rote learning hand-in-hand with developing the child’s mastery over the material.\n>\n> In the current educational climate, memorization and repetition in the STEM disciplines (as opposed to in the study of language or music), are often seen as demeaning and a waste of time for students and teachers alike [...] What this all means is that, despite the fact that procedural skills and fluency, along with application, are supposed to be given equal emphasis with conceptual understanding, all too often it doesn’t happen\n>\n> The problem with focusing relentlessly on understanding is that math and science students can often grasp essentials of an important idea, but this understanding can quickly slip away without consolidation through practice and repetition.\n>\n> Worse, students often believe they understand something when, in fact, they don’t. By championing the importance of understanding, teachers can inadvertently set their students up for failure as those students blunder in illusions of competence\n\nThis echoes the ideas in this video by the Math Sorcerer: [Stop Trying To Understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzXZ4-KzBLs).\n\nShe explores the connection between learning math & science and learning sport. By using the procedure a lot, applying it in many situations, you will understand both the why and how. Stop focusing on understanding.\n\n> When you learn how to swing a golf club, you perfect that swing from lots of repetition over a period of years. Your body knows what to do from a single thought—one chunk—instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball.\n>\n> once you understand why you do something in math and science, you don’t have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it\n>\n> The greater understanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of meaning. Continually focusing on understanding itself actually gets in the way.\n\nWhen learning Russian, she focused on fluency, and not understanding of the language. She didn't want to simply understand Russian that is heard or read, she wanted \"an internalized, deep-rooted fluency with teh words and language structure\". How does she do this? By playing around with verbs, using them in sentences, learning when to (and not to) use them.\n\n> Fluency of something whole like a language requires a kind of familiarity that only repeated and varied interaction with the parts can develop.\n>\n> I wouldn’t just be satisfied to know that понимать meant “to understand.” I’d practice with the verb—putting it through its paces by conjugating it repeatedly with all sorts of tenses, and then moving on to putting it into sentences, and then finally to understanding not only when to use this form of the verb, but also when not to use it.\n\nThis led her to the fundamental core of learning and development of expertise – chunking, which is how experts become experts, by storing thousands of chunks in their area of expertise in their long-term memory.\n\n> Chunking was originally conceptualized in the groundbreaking work of Herbert Simon in his analysis of chess\n>\n> neuroscientists came to realize that experts such as chess grand masters are experts because they have stored thousands of chunks of knowledge about their area of expertise in their long-term memory\n>\n> Whatever the discipline, experts can call up to consciousness one or several of these well-knit-together, chunked neural subroutines to analyze and react to a new learning situation. This level of true understanding, and ability to use that understanding in new situations, comes only with the kind of rigor and familiarity that <mark>repetition, memorization, and practice</mark> can foster\n\nShe applies the same strategy of language-learning into learning math and engineering. She played with the letters and alphabets in an equation, and build chunks around them.\n\n> I’d look at an equation, to take a very simple example, Newton’s second law of f = ma. I practiced feeling what each of the letters meant—f for force was a push, m for mass was a kind of weighty resistance to my push, and a was the exhilarating feeling of acceleration.\n>\n> I memorized the equation so I could carry it around with me in my head and play with it. If m and a were big numbers, what did that do to f when I pushed it through the equation? If f was big and a was small, what did that do to m? How did the units match on each side?\n>\n> the truth was that to learn math and science well, I had to <mark>slowly, day by day, build solid neural “chunked” subroutines</mark>—such as surrounding the simple equation f = ma—that I could easily call to mind from long term memory\n\nSo, focus on building well-ingrained chunks of expertise through practice and repetition.\n\n> <mark>Understanding doesn’t build fluency; instead, fluency builds understanding</mark>. In fact, I believe that true understanding of a complex subject comes only from fluency.\n>\n> gaining fluency through **practice, repetition, and rote learning** — but rote learning that emphasized the ability to think flexibly and quickly.\n>\n> Fluency allows understanding to become embedded, emerging when needed.\n\nTakeaways by Claude 3 Sonnet:\n\n- Practice > understanding for building true mastery\n- Classroom \"understanding\" can create an illusion of competence\n- Repetitive practice builds neural \"chunks\" that allow rapid, intuitive expertise\n- Experts draw on vast memories of chunked patterns/subroutines\n- Fluency is key - understanding follows fluency, not vice versa\n",

You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, \"Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.\"\n2. You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).\n3. You should mention anything you have learned from your target.\n4. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.\n\nVia [Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18378002-intuition-pumps-and-other-tools-for-thinking), by Daniel C. Dennett.\n\nSome other quotes from the book:\n\n> No matter how smart you are, you’re smarter if you take the easy ways when they are available.\n\n> Philosophy—in every field of inquiry—is what you have to do until you figure out what questions you should have been asking in the first place.\n\n> Carpenters don’t make their saws and hammers, tailors don’t make their scissors and needles, and plumbers don’t make their wrenches, but blacksmiths can make their hammers, tongs, anvils, and chisels\n",

It could be verbal like \"Wow, look at that sunset!\" or non-verbal like letting out a sign.\n\nWhether these bids are met with warmth or indifference by the other person is going to significantly influence the sense of safety and belonging that we feel in that relationship and that's going to shape the strength of the relationship overtime.\n\nThere are three ways to we can respond to a bid for connection.\n\n1. [Towards](https://www.gottman.com/blog/a-deeper-look-into-turning-towards-your-partner/): engaging with and acknowledging the bid\n2. [Away](https://www.gottman.com/blog/a-deeper-look-into-turning-away-from-your-partner/): missing the bid or not commenting\n3. Against: rejecting the bid\n\nA few examples:\n\nBID: This article is so interesting!\n\n- Towards: Oh yeah? What's it about?\n- Away: Mhmmm, cool.\n- Against: It must be nice to have so much time to read.\n\nBID: You wouldn’t believe how difficult my day’s been.\n\n- Towards: Oh no, what happened?\n- Away: You think you had a hard day? Well, I have a story for you!\n- Against: When do you not have a bad day?\n\nBID: That was such an intense rainfall last night!\n\n- Towards: Yeah, that was super weird, right?\n- Away: I guess.\n- Against: You’re always so dramatic, it wasn’t that bad.\n\nBID: This isn’t working, could you come help me out for a second?\n\n- Towards: Sure thing, I’m just in the middle of something right now, but I can come in 10 minutes.\n- Away: (ignores the request)\n- Against: Figure it out yourself!\n\n### responsiveness\n\nWhat the humans like is [responsiveness](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-the-humans-like-is-responsiveness).\n\nRelationship thrives on responsiveness and die with dismissiveness.\n\nTurning towards build trust and connection.\n\nAnd turning away can actually be more harmful than turning against.\n\nIt feeds into the idea of social isolation, and it can be the silent killer of relationships.\n\nIt sends a subtle, but harmful message of indifference. It makes the person feel unseen and undervalued.\n\n> The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.\n> – Elie wiesel\n\nIt's not because we don't care about the person, it's just we get preoccupied or distracted, and we don't pick on the signals of bids for connections.\n\nA few tips provided by her:\n\n- Label it: voice out your bid / when the other person is turning away or against\n- Go deeper: Turn towards and ask deeper questions, not just superficial reactions\n- Acknowledge + defer: if you can't drop what you're doing now, ask for time later, the important part is acknowledging the bid first\n\n<mark>The strongest relationships are the one where the effort is at least consistently made.</mark>\n\nTry to master the art of those tiny moments.\n\n> \"The secret to strong, healthy relationships isn't in grand gestures, but in these small, often overlooked ways we can turn towards the people we most care about.\"\n",

Nuclear power provides stable baseload power and is one of the safest forms of electrical power generation\n- It produces a tiny amount of nuclear waste, which can be managed despite opposition\n- Once built and paid off, nuclear plants can last 100 years and provide inexpensive, stable power\n- The [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France?useskin=vector) have perfected building nuclear plants cost-effectively, achieving economies of scale and low carbon intensity\n  - as of Dec 2023, they generate 2/3 of electricity from nuclear.\n  - they have one of the lowest CO2 emissions per unit of [electricity](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) in the world at 85g of CO2/kWh, compared to global average of 438.\n\n### on Fusion\n\n- Dave spent 5 years working on fusion energy at Google, mostly exploring ideas that didn't pan out\n- [Commonwealth Fusion Sciences](https://cfs.energy/), an MIT startup, has a promising approach combining high-temperature superconductivity with toroidal [Tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) fusion\n- Their approach is based on well-understood models, making it more predictable and engineerable\n- However, fusion is still at an early stage, similar to solar energy in the 1950s before silicon cells became practical\n- Fusion may be viable for future generations, but serious decarbonization efforts can't rely on it in the near-term\n\n### what he wished people knew more about energy\n\n- energy in food\n  - You can put food into a calorimeter and figure out its energy content in joules.\n  - For a potato, if you burn it in a calorimeter, you'll find out how many joules of energy it contains.\n  - You can then trace back how many joules of fossil energy it took to produce that potato.\n  - Divide the fossil energy input by the food energy output, and you get a dimensionless ratio in joules per joule.\n  - For a potato, it's something like one quarter of a joule of fossil energy per joule of food energy, so a 4 to 1 ratio.\n  - That's not great that fossil energy is still burned to make a potato, but at least it's 4 joules out for every 1 in.\n  - If you look at the American diet on average, it's about 8 joules of fossil energy per joule of food energy.\n  - So the American diet is about 30 times worse than just eating potatoes in terms of embedded fossil energy.\n- energy in air travel\n  - He's happy Google Flights shows you the tons of CO2 emitted for flight routes.\n  - People should especially avoid short flights, as a lot of emissions come from the energy expended in the climb to cruising altitude.\n  - For short flights, planes may never reach that cruising altitude before descending.\n  - Long distance isn't good either, as it burns more fuel over a longer distance.\n  - If people were more aware, we'd have electrified high-speed rail networks which are much easier to decarbonize than air travel.\n  - Airplanes running on batteries are either too heavy or too short range currently.\n\n### imparting words\n\n- get to know your neighbors and the people around you\n- volunteer for a nonprofit / start your own like Dave\n- Dave started his own nonprofit that he volunteers for\n- <mark>find joy and happiness close to home</mark> and in their own communities, this can make communities stronger and happier\n- The implication is that being engaged locally and finding fulfillment in one's community can lead to lower climate impacts from factors like reduced consumption, travel, etc.\n",

    "content": "\n![The Matrix color grading](/images/matrixcolor.jpeg)\n\nToday is one of those days where time anxiously melted away as I struggled to get anything that I planned to get done before April ends. I have it all in my head, but I just lack the energy and will to even move. Headaches are the worst.\n\nIt feels time is ticking as May now come crashing on me, and the day I fly back to the US creeps up to me closer and closer. I still have so much to accomplish.\n\nBut then I remember time is relative, and we're all going to die one day, so I'm glad I just did what I enjoyed doing. I rewatched The Matrix and watch a few videos on color grading today. I have approx. 531 video shots from my HK SZ trip, and I plan to edit them into a film-like cinematic vlog.\n\nAfter falling into the rabbit hole of color grading, all I've learned so far is how complicated it is, and how they have their own language that you have to learn. It's both exciting and overwhelming. For now, the biggest questions in my head are whether I have to color grade each individual scene, how I will blend all of them together nicely, whether shooting in iPhone 13 mini with HDR still requires color space transform, and how to make my vlog film-like without paying.\n\nI took some notes for their terminologies from this video: [Color Grading 101 - Everything You Need to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAh83khT1no)\n\n- color correction\n  - the step before color grading where you tweak the white balance, exposure, highlights, mid tones, and noise reduction, etc.\n- color grading\n  - add character and atmosphere to scenes by adding curves, masks, color wheels, grain, glow, chromatic aberrations\n- color spaces\n  - most common profile REC. 709 (est. 1990)\n  - this ensures all devices display the same image (of the same color)\n  - Rec. 2020 is the new richer color space with HDR, which allows for more brightness, very vivid colors and deep blacks\n  - there are acquisition color spaces which are specific color spaces optimized for camera manufacturers with specific sensors\n- RAW\n  - saves as much information received by the sensor as possible.\n  - it's much larger in storage, but you can a ton of useful data.\n  - it's recorded in 12/14 bits, which are number of colors can be obtained. 12 bits = 4096 (R) x 4096 (G) x 4096 (b) = 68 billion colors.\n- LOG\n  - alternative to RAW which uses an optimized gamma curve to record as much information in an image as possible in highlights and shadows\n  - uses a log curve rather than linear to record highlights and shadows\n- LUT: Look-up Table\n  - technical LUTs are used in video production to see something close to the final result while shooting in raw, most monitors/cameras have this\n  - creative LUTs are color filters that you can apply to switch from one style to another, you can download packs from specific movies to copy their look.\n- nodes\n  - like layers in photoshop, it's a great visual workflow to add adjustments and effects in an organized and non-destructive way, making it easy to rework upstream and downstream of each step\n  - an oscilloscope that displays brightness levels of different areas of an image in real time.\n  - for evaluating exposure and balancing an image's luminance\n- Scopes\n  - tools that ensure our edits are not degrading the image and is balanced overall.\n  - the three main ones are waveforms, RGB parade and vectorscope\n- Waveforms\n  - a graph that shows highlights and low lights\n  - it's a vertical graph that goes from 0 - 100, if your waveform is crashing against the top and bottom, it's over/under exposed, respectively\n- RGB parade\n  - a waveform monitor broken into three graphs: RGB channels\n  - useful for controlling exposure and white balance, i.e. if the image has a blue cast, you can see the blue graphic shift up compared to the other two, so you can bring it down to make it balanced\n- Vectorscope\n  - like a compass for colors, showing you where colors in your video lie and how intense they are\n  - plots color intensity and hue of an image on a circular graph\n  - used primarily for adjusting skin tones and color balance\n    - it should be around the center for color, the more away it is from the center, the more saturation\n    - for skin tone, it should fall along the 11 o'clock position, a diagonal line between the red and yellow lines.\n\n### Inspirations\n\n- [CHINA TOWN (FX30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gwtz5Yzk2M)\n- [New York City Film Emulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty6XXvvA8nk)\n- [Japan – Gawx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd8ap3GcAyA)\n- [Three Days in Vienna | Fuji xH2s | Sigma 18-35mm 1.8 | Graded with Dehancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEjtTx-1ZfU)\n- [Solo in Porto | Cinematic Video 4K | #Fujifilm XT30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3lEGYoOoTY)\n\n### More tutorials\n\nColor grading from 0\n\n- [How to Color Grade From 0 with Davinci Resolve (for Beginners) ✧ Asian, Japanese, Chinese Film Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt9sv_HfTw)\n- [From Start to Finish: Mastering Color Grading in DaVinci Resolve for a Full Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joJ5_o278PU)\n\nFilm effect for free\n\n- [Emulating 16mm or 35mm Film // Color Grading Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45z60vnPOBw&t=440s)\n- [Davinci Resolve Film Look + Free PowerGrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI8jj9pE6gU)\n- [How to Get a RETRO FILM LOOK in DaVinci Resolve 18 Color Grading Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zai08FOZ0fU)\n\nnode trees\n\n- [The BEST Node Tree for ANY Camera!

We manipulate the function in a way that when it is minimized, the network is doing what we want it to do.\n- Then we backward the loss, use backpropagation to get the gradients, which tells us how to tune the parameters to decrease the loss locally\n- This process is iterated many times in gradient descent. Where we follow the gradient information to minimize the loss, until it is close to / at zero.\n- fundamentally, this neural network setup and training is identical and pervasive in all kinds of AI tasks, where it differs is in how we're updating the weights (simple MLP uses stochastic GD), and in computing the loss function (MSE is the simplest, cross-entropy loss is used for predicting next word)\n\nDerivative\n\n- a way to nudge a function to see how sensitive it is and whether it goes in the positive or negative direction.\n- why? so that when minimizing the loss function in ML, we know which direction and by how much to adjust during gradient descent\n- the math: $f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$, derivative of function at point x is the limit of the slope as h approaches zero.\n\nforward pass\n\n- traversing through the neural network with the input data, where each neuron in each layer processes the data based on its weight and bias, until it reaches the output layer which is the prediction.\n- path: input data -> neural network: layer by layer calculate output sequentially by applying weighted sum of inputs and a bias -> non-linear activation function -> output\n- math: the output of a layer is defined as $y = \\sigma(Wx + b)$ where $\\sigma$ is the activation function, $W$ is the weight matrix, $x$ is the input vector, and $b$ is the bias matrix.\n\nbackprop\n\n- going backwards through the network to adjust the weights to reduce the error between the predictions and actual data\n- how? it computes the gradient of the loss function w.r.t each weight in the network using chain rule, which allows gradient descent to find the direction and magnitude of the weight that will minimize the loss.\n- analogy: we have knobs in a machine, where each knob directly affects each other to minimize the loss function, instead of randomly turning each of them, backprop tells you which knob to turn and by how much,\n\nMore resources\n\n- [Yes you should understand backprop](https://karpathy.medium.com/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b)\n- 3blue1brown’s [What is backpropagation really doing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U) & [Backpropagation calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8)\n- [The Most Important Machine Learning Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZmBKc7Lrs)\n- [CS231n lecture on backprop](https://cs231n.github.io/optimization-2/)\n",

From one ink, variously diluted and masterfully applied, springs an evocative mountain scene: a wine tavern by a lake, complete with two boaters at the bottom right](/images/sesshu.jpg)\n\n### Red\n\n> in the glossy reds of blood we saw reflected our own lives and bodies;\n\n![L'Atelier Rouge , 1911, Henri Matisse](/images/redstudio.jpeg)\n\n![The Dessert: Harmony in Red, 1908, Henri Matisse](/images/redroom.jpeg)\n\n![Le verre de porto (A Dinner Table at Night), 1884, John Singer Sargent](/images/dinnertable.jpeg)\n\n### Yellow\n\n> in the blinding yellow sun we glimpsed, through squinted eyes, our most powerful gods;\n\n![In this Annunciation, by Fra Angelico in the 1420s, God is a golden sun, and his divine message a beam of light](/images/annunciation.jpg)\n\n![Turner’s Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus is dominated by a vast and heroic sunset. The faint outlines of stallions carrying the sun over the horizon can just be made out](/images/polyphemus.jpg)\n\n![In Regulus, Turner used chrome yellow and lead white to re-create the intense experience of staring directly into the sun. Contemporary critics advised viewers to keep a safe distance](/images/regulus.jpeg)\n\n![The evanescent sunrise behind Norham Castle depends on a phenomenon called isoluminance. In black and white, we can see the sun’s yellow haze is exactly the same brightness as the blue sky around it](/images/norham.jpg)\n\n### Blue\n\n> and in cerulean skies and and seas we imagined worlds beyond our horizons.\n\n![Wassily Kandinsky’s Improvisation 19 (also known as Blue Sound) is dominated by an exuberant blue haze that seems to transfigure the figures who pass through it](/images/bluesound.jpeg)\n\n![Bacchus and Ariadne (1522–1523), Titian](/images/bacchus.jpg)\n\n### White\n\n> We championed clean white surfaces as paragons of visual, moral, and social purity\n\n![Suprematist Composition: White on White (1918), Kazimir Malevich](/images/whiteonwhite.png)\n\n![White Painting, 1951, Robert Rauschenberg](/images/whitepainting.jpeg)\n\n### Purple\n\n> celebrated the synthetic purples of the nineteenth century as beacons of technological progress\n\n![Monet’s The Houses of Parliament, Seagulls is a pageant of purples](/images/parliament.jpeg)\n\n![view of Waterloo Bridge, city’s industrial skyline smothered with synthetic purple emissions](/images/monetwaterloo.jpeg)\n\n### Green\n\n> and embraced the myriad greens of nature as emblems of paradise and renewal.\n\n![The Green Interior (Figure Seated by a Curtained Window), 1891, Édouard Vuillard](/images/greeninterior.jpeg)\n\n![Camille, 1866, Claude Monet](/images/greendress.jpeg)\n\n![Still Life: Vase with Pink Roses, 1890, Vincent van Gogh](/images/stilllife.jpeg)\n\n> We have projected these hopes, anxieties, and obsessions onto color for thousands of years. The history of color, therefore, is also a history of humanity.\n",

    "content": "\n![Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish](/images/somethingwonderful.png)\n\nI read [Make Something Wonderful](https://stevejobsarchive.com/book) in the plane ride back to Malaysia from Hong Kong and the whole time I was immersed and when the plane landed I felt more alive and agentic than ever.\n\nIt's a curated collection of his speeches, interviews, and correspondence. His whole story was inspiring and I loved a lot of the things he said in his speeches and emails.\n\nThis blog is my curated collection of that collection.\n\n---\n\n### On his childhood\n\n- his father was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and was kind of a genius with his hands.\n- when he was 5, his father spent a lot of time teaching him how to build things, take things apart, put things back together\n- He later met Larry Lang, a man who built [Heathkits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathkit?useskin=vector). These kits gave him an understand of what was inside a finished product and how it worked, and the sense that **one could build the things that one saw around oneself in the universe**.\n- it gave a tremendous degree of self-confidence that, through **exploration and learning**, one could understand seemingly very complex things in one's environment.\n\n### On California\n\n- California had a sense of experimentation, and a sense of openness about it – openness and new possibility – that I didn't appreciate till I went to other places.\n\n### On aesthetics and taste\n\n- a bunch of little things influenced him: wine labels, paintings in galleries. Simple things. Nothing real profound, just lots and lots of little things.\n- I don't think my taste in aesthetics is that much different than a lot of other people's. The difference is I just get to **be really stubborn about making things as good as we all know they can be**\n- Things get more refined as you make mistakes. Your aesthetics get better as you make mistakes.\n- It doesn't take any more energy – and rarely does it take more money – to make it really great. All it takes is a little more time. [...] And a willingness to do so, a willingness to persevere until it's really great.\n- good aesthetics results from just your eye. And instinct of what you see, not so much what you do.\n\n### On character\n\n- people's spark of self-consciousness turns on at about 15 or 16.\n- Humanities lecture in Reed college, i.e. Shakespeare with professor Svitavsky felt meaningless and even cruel endeavors to be put through, but looking back, it helped him in everything he's ever done.\n- he learned about situational ethics from people at the Hare Krishna temple\n- \"Character is built not in good times, but in bad times; not in a time of plenty, but in a time of adversity\"\n\n### On liberal arts\n\n- Apple's major contribution was bringing a liberal arts point of view to the use of computers\n- the driving motivation behind the ease of use of the Macintosh was not just to get more people to use computers, it was to bring beautiful fonts and typography and graphics to people, to see beautiful photographs or pictures, or artwork, etc. to help them communicate what they were doing.\n- Computer science and science is a liberal art. It's something that everyone should know how to use, at least, and harness in their life. It's not something that should be relegated to 5 percent of the population over in the corner. It's something that everybody should be exposed to, everyone should have a master of, to some extent, and that's how we viewed computation, or these computation devices.\n\n### On apple's culture\n\n- there wasn't a hierarchy of ideas that mapped onto the hierarchy of the organization. Great ideas could come from anywhere.\n- we hired truly great people and gave them the room to do great work.\n- A lot of companies hire people to tell them what to do, we hired people to tell them us to do.\n\n### On intuitive feelings (dreams)\n\n- Be aware of the world's magical, mystical, and artistic sides. The most important things in life are not the goal-oriented, materialistic things that everyone and everything tries to convince you to strive for.\n- Whatever it may be, I bet many of you have had some of these intuitive feelings about what you could do with your lives. These feelings are very real, and if nurtured can blossom into something wonderful and magical. A good way to remember these kinds of intuitive feelings is to <mark>walk alone near sunset – and spend a lot of time looking at the sky</mark> in general. We are never taught to listen to our intuitions, to develop and nurture our intuitions. But if you do <mark>pay attention to these subtle insights, you can make them come true.</mark>\n- People will come at you with reasons why you shouldn't do these things (writing songs won't help you make a living). You could be doing so much more in your life. (Einstein working at a low-level job in the Swiss patent office)\n- If you don't have any of these feelings, called dreams, then you're in trouble.\n\n### On creativity\n\n- Be a creative person. <mark>Creativity equals connecting previously unrelated experiences and insights that others don't see.</mark>\n- You have to have them to connect them. Creative people feel guilty that they are simply relaying what they \"see\". How do you get a more diverse set of experiences? Not by traveling the same path as everyone else.\n- to be creative, feed or invest in yourself by exploring uncharted paths that are outside the realm of your past experience. Seek out new dimensions of yourself – especially those that carry a romantic scent\n- The only thing one can do is to believe that some of what you follow with your heart will indeed come back to make your life much richer. And it will. And you will gain an ever firmer trust in your instincts and intuition.\n\n### On career and loving your work\n\n- The enemy of most dreams and intuition, and one of the most dangerous and stifling concepts ever invented by humans, is the \"Career\"\n- If you are passionate about your life and your work, they become more or less one. This is a much better way to live one's life.\n- <mark>Make your avocation your vocation. Make what you love your work</mark>\n- The journey is the reward. The reward is in crossing the rainbow.\n- <mark>Think of your life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon of this world. You appear, have a chance to blaze in teh sky, then you disappear</mark>\n  - The two endpoints of everyone's rainbow are birth and death. We all experience both completely alone\n  - To know my arc will fall makes me want to blaze while I am in the sky.\n- You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.\n\n### On mistakes\n\n- regrets are different from mistakes\n- mistakes = things you did and wish you could do over again.\n  - Some mistakes are deep, and others not. But if your intent was pure, they're almost always enriching in some way.\n- regrets = things you didn't do, and wish you did.\n\n### On hiring young A players\n\n- You'd better have great people, or you won't get your product to market as fast as possible.\n- There are no shortcuts around quality, and quality starts with people\n- for young people, you must evaluate potential. The primary attributes are 1) intelligence and the ability to learn quickly and 2) drive and passion – hard work makes up for a lot\n- I will purposely upset someone by criticizing their prior work. The worst thing someone can do in an interview is agree with me. <mark>What I look for is someone to come right back and say \"You're dead wrong and here's why\"</mark>. I want to see what people are like under pressure. I want to see if they just fold or if they have firm conviction, belief, and pride in what they did.\n- If your company is a meritocracy of ideas, with passionate people, you have a company with a lot of arguments. If people can't stand up and argue well under pressure, they may not do well in such an environment.\n\n### On his weakness\n\n- I'm too idealistic. [I need to] realize that sometimes best is the enemy of better.\n- Sometimes I go for \"best\" when I should go for \"better\", and end up going nowhere or backwards.\n- I'm blinded by \"what could be\" versus \"what is possible\", doing things incrementally versus doing them in one fell swoop.\n- <mark>Balancing the ideal and the practical</mark> is something that I still must pay attention to.\n\n### On a CEO's job\n\n- Cajole and bed and plead and threaten at times – to do what is necessary to get people to see things in a bigger and more profound way than they have, and to do better work than they thought they could do.\n- When they do their best and you don't think it isn't enough, you tell them straight \"This isn't good enough. I know you can do better. You need to do better. Now go do better.\"\n- 1\\) recruit, 2\\) set an overall direction, 3\\) inspire and cajole and persuade.\n\n### Apple's hierarchy of Skepticism\n\n- survival > stable business > product strategy > growth\n\n### His favorite quote\n\n> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then is not an act, but a habit – Aristotle\n\n### On culture and connection\n\n- There's tradition in SV. There's role models, and there's legends, and there's all sorts of folklore – the kind of thing that makes a culture. Many people don't spend time to learn about it. But some people find themselves in it, and slowly start to absorb it and get curious as to what came before them.\n- There's human drama to most everything. You look at it sometimes, and it seems as dry as history. But if you peel the onion, there's humanity underneath.\n- Just to understand what's going on now – you can't really do that unless you understand how it got here.\n\n> He who loves to see two or three generations is like a man who sits some time in the conjurer's booth at a fair and witnesses the performance twice or thrice in succession. The tricks were meant ot be seen only once; and when they are no longer a novelty and cease to deceive, their effect is gone.\n>\n> – Schopenhauer's On the Suffering of the World\n\n### On tech 🤝 creativity\n\n- tech and content companies have no understanding of each other\n- the creative process is as disciplined as any engineering process. And they're as passionate about it as any technical person.\n- tech companies have a wide, dynamic range of capability and elegance. there's creativity in the process.\n\n### on management\n\n- when he was younger: management by objective. \"You accomplished none of your objectives, you're fired\"\n- now: management by values: find people that want the same things you want, and then just get the hell out of their way.\n  - have a good enough place to go, that's got a long enough focal length that it will survive over time, that everybody agrees on, and don't codify how you're going to get there. So that each generation can argue anew about the best way to get to San Diego.\n\n### On death\n\n- <mark>\"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. </mark>\n- Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because a most everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.\n- Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n- Death is likely the single best invention of life. It is life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.\n- <mark>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.</mark> Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, <mark>have the courage to follow your heart and intuition</mark>. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\n\n### his famous email to himself\n\n> I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.  \n> I do not make any of my own clothing.  \n> I speak a language I did not invent or refine.  \n> I did not discover the mathematics I use.  \n> I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.  \n> I am moved by music I did not create myself.\n> When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.  \n> I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.  \n> I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.\n>\n> September 2, 2010, 11:08 p.m.\n\n### my favorite quote of his\n\n> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact—and that is： everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.\n> And you can change it.  \n> You can influence it.  \n> You can build your own things that other people can use.  \n> And the minute you can understand that you can poke life, and if you push in, then something will pop out the other side; that you can change it, you can mold it—that's maybe the most important thing: to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there, and you're just going to live in it versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.  \n> I think that's very important, and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better. Because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways.  \n> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.  \n> — Steve, 1994\n",

In contrast, just one poor choice by one side leads to war” – Yuval\n- Complex to make, Simple to break – humans (making one is complex, death is simple)\n- A lot of progress and good news concerns things that didn’t happen, making hard to contextualize and measure\n- HK has no sales tax so apple is cheaper here than china\n\nThe ferry ride\n\n- The ferry is so slow, but makes sense since it's a short distance, only 8 minutes, the foggy view reminded me of SF\n- It's cheap, only 2 dollars for 4 people.\n- I liked hearing the sounds of ocean waves crash ing on the boat, the smell of the sea in the breeze, and the conversations of other tourists.\n\n\"The World According to color\" notes in eslite spectrum near Tsim Sha Tsui port\n\n- “Color is the touch of the eye, music to the deaf, a word out of the darkness” – Orhan Pamuk\n- Velázuez recognized the power of black, Édouard Manet revered him and also saw the potential of black\n- Turner’s color charts\n- Turner’s Ulysses deriding Polyphemus\n- Wassily Kadinsky’s improvisation 19 (Blue Sound)\n- Tutuan’s Bacchus made with the most exotic and expensive pigments in 16th ct Venice. Features some of the purest ultramarine ever identified in the history of art\n- Monet’s house of parliament, Seagulls is a pageant of purples\n- Howard Hodgkins’s Leaf – one of the most endearing color association – green and vegetation\n\nLast paragraph of the book\n\n> The ancient Egyptian term for 'colour' was iwn - a word that also meant 'skin', 'nature', 'character' and 'being', and was represented in part by a hieroglyph of human hair. The members of that formidable civilization had noticed a striking resemblance between colours and humans. To them colours were just like people - full of life, energy, power and personality. We now understand, as the Egyptians could only sense, how thoroughly the two are entangled. Colour, after all, is ultimately made by its perceivers. Every hue we see around us is actually manufactured within us - in the same grey matter that forms language, stores memories, stokes emotions, shapes thoughts and gives rise to consciousness. <mark>Colour is a pigment of our imaginations that we paint all over the world. Larger than any city, more intricate than any machine, more beautiful than any painting, it might in fact be the greatest human creation of them all.</mark>\n\nI love discounted small cute stuff at bookstores, bought a tiger pin, a mini sketchbook and Perpetua pencil, an 80% graphite pencil made in Italy\n\nairport -> home\n\n- MOS burger stands for mountain, ocean and Sun\n- I'm so tired today, what happened, did I not sleep well. family says it's like I never slept at all\n- Sleeping on the buses and trains is the best feeling\n\nI love reading in planes\n\n- Read \"Make Something Wonderful\" by Steve Jobs and it's so inspiring. I couldn't stop reading it. Especially his speeches and emails. He was a true visionary, reading about the things he predicted back in the 80s and seeing it all come true now is surreal.\n- I felt more alive, it was the jumpstart I need being back from the trip. It's time to start building again. May is the month where I achieve all my goals.\n",

    "content": "\n![Central Pier, HK](/images/hkpier.jpg)\n\nWent to Tsutaya bookstore in Future City and the art section is amazing.\n\nSome artists to look into\n\n- Egon Schiele\n- Alfons Mucha\n- JMW Turner\n- Hilma Klint\n- Modigliani\n- Robert Coutelas\n- Marc Chagall\n- David Hockney\n- Jasper Johns\n- Gerhard Richter\n- Jean Philippe Delhomme – A paris journal\n- Sean Scully – the shape of ideas\n- Judd\n- Anselm Kirger\n- Yamada Masaaki\n\nthoughts on spending + art\n\n- I went to get to the point of wealth where I can buy things without feeling guilty, yet still maintain gratitude for being able to obtain it. I feel like when you have a lot of money and you can afford everything, it no longer feels rewarding because it was so easy to get it, whereas now, since I can’t just but anything I want, and I have to actively and carefully filter out only a few, it has more meaning\n- Bought postcards of Hokusai and flowers for 217¥ , decided not to buy Hokusai’s sketchbooks Vol 2. whole earth because it was 180¥\n- Mom is asking a good question, why am I so interested in art, why was I not before? Was it because no one introduced me to it? I think it all started when I got the great wave tapestry. But what is my goal here with learning about art and being so obsessed with it, is it all just to feel nice? To study what makes it nice and try to recreate it? I think it’s a good way to be absorbing and exposing myself to all these styles so that I can develop my own maybe. Isn’t that what artists do? They gather inspiration and form their own by injecting their own personality, life experiences, and emotions\n- buying local snacks when traveling for coworkers and friends as a necessary practice and culture? Is it mostly a girls thing? Maybe it's cause I don’t have much friends in Malaysia and I don’t see a point, whereas my sister has work friends\n\nback to HK\n\n- customs is even slower entering HK, had to wait in line twice, I like seeing different kinds of faces and accents in the foreigner line.\n- it's hard to get a taxi in HK, they have an app for it but the app is terrible\n- Bishop Lei International House has a great view, we got upgraded to deluxe twin bed rooms for free 1100 HKD for two rooms.\n- Got scolded by the bus driver, shouted at us and asked us to pay 9.5 HKD per person\n- Tried Kwan Kee Claypot rice (best claypot in Central based on reviews) and it was just ok, their sausage is weird it feels like I bit into a piece of coal, more bitter than savory. Was pricey too 100 HKD per pot\n- Got to experience the HK tram, only 3 HKD for any stop\n- Go to IFC mall with tram (north bound), and walk to the pier after claypot\n\nSome building names I can see from pier no. 9 near the HK observation wheel in Star Ferry Pier.\n\n- AIA\n- FWD\n- 1664\n- CITIC\n- CONRAD\n- LIPPO\n- 中国人寿\n- Mandarin Oriental\n- UBS\n- Prudential\n- YMCA\n- 招商局\n\nthoughts at the pier\n\n- Lots of people jogging here at night\n- and of course lots of couples too, I saw two couples kissing like animals, I applaud the courage they have to do that in public\n- I feel like Howl in his green slimy state a lot of times, especially when I look bad in pictures, feel worthless a lot of times which is such a waste of time and energy, when I can just be happy and laugh about it\n- Feeling very melancholy when looking at the pier at night, La La Land and yellow was playing in my head. But the laughs and jokes with my family makes me appreciate that I have them in my life, and travelling with family, albeit comes with its own complications and frustrations, is something that is underappreciated and very temporary, soon parents will be too old to travel like this.\n- Taxi driver asked us why we never boarded his car (which was the first one in line), apparently it’s an implicit rule to do that here, in Malaysia we just get on any one of them\n- I waste so much of my time having the same thoughts over and over again and I can’t tell if they’re productive or not, it's something that I have to do it to know, and I keep imagining the outcome, playing that movie in my head whenever I have space to think. I wish I had better thoughts that were more useful and related to creating solutions for important problems.\n\nthoughts while looking out the window from the hotel room\n\n- HK is like san francisco but you can build apartments, so it's hilly in central HK and you can find skyscrapers all cramped together, creating a cool effect.\n- house prices are definitely expensive, I saw a lot of foreigners while going out for claypot tonight, I wonder if they enjoy their life in HK, and why they chose to be here if it wasn't just for business\n- hard to buy anything here, my sister kept wishing to be back in shenzhen to buy more things, I'm still amazed by the \\$35 fake nike that I think costs >\\$1000 in StockX for the real one.\n- I checked my email after being blocked in China for a few days and I really didn't miss anything. It was a helpful detox from the things that filled up my time and helped me reflect on whether they added value to my life.\n",

They’re only 35$ too which is insane\n- I find it stressful to shop for clothes and interacting with people, maybe its the insecurity again, I don’t like checking myself in the mirror\n- Store owners here are so good at selling, they’ll recommend me clothes, then ask me to get shoes and pants as well, and praise the quality of the shoes, but I wonder how much of it I can trust\n- We were here from 7 pm till 12am wow\n- Taxis are 2.7¥ per kilometer\n",

A few thoughts:\n\n- I had so many dreams today, in the morning, and later in taxis and trains.\n- Lightroom ios is good enough for editing film like photos\n- I didn't know beef shiu mai existed\n- why is forcing people to buy tea a thing\n- HK people being rude is definitely a thing, it's like all of them they woke up on the wrong side of the bed\n- HK -> China customs is painstakingly slow\n- the bullet train was so fast it felt like 5 minutes.\n- Why can't I take pictures in customs is it a security law, I got called out lol\n- A young taxi driver did not help us with b ags but the old one did thought it would be reversed\n- It's so hard to find a hotel here, there are three hotels named T hotel, and ended up staying in the wrong one in the end\n  - lesson: check properly the next time I book hotels, note the location and the possibility of different branches\n- subway here is super cheap\n- I had spicy and sour fish and I loved it, I think my body is beginning to accept it.\n- came to a more suburb part of shenzhen and it felt like Taiwan it was peaceful, I saw this nice street with a lot of trees, and old people with small kids holding hands\n- Motorcycles here are electric, very quiet and dangerous as they go on the sidewalks\n- Diaphragm crams are so scary I felt like I was gonna die, I had one that lasted 20 minutes at this lanzhou noodles restaurant after eating some sour and spicy food and am now afraid\n- Saw a corgi poop on the subway tunnels\n- Shopping malls are mostly catered for females where are the clothing stores for men\n- It would be cool if I could read greek\n- Xiaomi is apple in China?\n- Xiaomi 14 ultra has 140x zoom that's crazy\n- Getting a fold phone would actually be useful I can read blogs on a bigger screen, but too heavy though ill yet 5 more years\n- My respect for a mall goes up 100% if it has a bookstore, and a cat store\n- Chinese book covers are nicer for some reason\n- wish I can read a chinese book without feeling like I'm doing a test\n- I wanna sit in a bookstore all day\n- Wow they made Ghibli into books\n- How do people internet in China i don't know how to use the internet at all without a vpn\n- china TV (Xiaomi) is very interesting, it's like tiktok their interface is very addictive\n",

    "content": "\n![Bohemian Garden, Level 5F, K11 KREA mall](/images/hk2.jpeg)\n\nanother thoughts dump for today\n\n- mom was watching a church service on tv which woke me up and I went back to bed, I felt so confused I forgot where I was\n- helped dad navigate to shenzhen, sent him everything on his phone with details and he had to write the same things down on paper again, it's smart because you can always trust hard copies\n- Dad took my sd card and adaptor in his luggage by accident so sadly no camera for the day\n- My entire plan for central HK gone because of the rain. I was pretty upset. Still hard to regulate my emotions completely when things don’t go my way, as if the world revolves around me. I still have a lot more growing up to do in managing expectations and having backup plans.\n- Left hotel at 11am instead of 8, when travelling with family, it's almost impossible to leave on time.\n- in K11 art mall\n  - Was so hungry I couldn't breathe, taiwanese and HK food was pricey, so went to Bugis Junction (Singaporean) instead for RM60 hainanese chicken rice that was pretty good.\n  - Found myself constantly observing and studying how people dress, and questioning makes them look good (maybe it's a combination of physical looks + what they wear).\n    - it makes me self-conscious about the way I'm dressing, and makes me want to buy clothing to emulate them, your environment really shapes you\n- I have this bias that good looking people only care a lot about their looks and are egoistic, arrogant, and shallow people, logically this could makes sense because it takes time, energy, and money, to maintain or have better looks (features and apparel), all of which can be poured into other more productive and selfless efforts that helps society. Or maybe I'm just projecting and making myself feel better for not being as good looking as them.\n- My insecurities are stronger here, I care more about how I look than the things I know or can do. I wonder what it takes for self-acceptance (acceptance therapy and self love?) how much of the things I do or say is seeking love and acceptance? Am I mostly acting out of this insecurity and fear? Why is it that sometimes I don’t want to be myself when I look in the mirror. I think these are high school insecurities I have to face and get rid of in therapy.\n- Not really enjoying this trip anymore with the rain, kind of regretting coming\n- K11 MUSEA\n  - Being in mall makes me want to buy things I don't even need and makes me realize how materialistic human beings are, and how silly it is to be buying expensive stuff either for status or for personal enjoyment when it can be contributed towards a good cause\n    - But at the same time these expensive items and clothing portray how well humans are at making beautiful and tasteful things, and how much we're willing to pay for nice things\n  - MoMA Design Store + the bohemian garden with the central HK view was the only ones worth going\n  - Art house is a cinema lol I was fooled\n  - there are art installations in the entire mall which is cool\n  - visited a sony store and was amazed by how fast new sony cameras are compared to my fujifilm and how heavy the lenses\n- central\n  - eventually came here when the rain died at 5pm and first thing we see upon coming out of central station was a lot of filipinos, we teleported to the philippines for a moment\n  - there was this Chinese restaurants here that requires you to pay for tea (18 HKD per person), we ordered water and the server was so confused lol\n- people watching\n  - Standing across SASA in Queens road central while my mom and sister shops at a clothing store called Bless, people watching for 30 minutes, I saw a guy walking his dog, lots of couples holding hands (some are laugh, some are more serious, some are both men which I still find it out of the ordinary), women limping while talking on the phone, kids jumping on puddles, teslas and HK taxis zooming past, tourist families, filipino people, some alone some are loud in big groups, two girl/guy best friend walking together, mother and son/daughter dynamics,\n  - thought about what my life would be like and what kind of person I would be if I was in HK. Would I be the lone wolf types who walk alone with headphones on, steady and focused, the couple type where I'm laughing and happy with someone while walking side by side, or with a best friend, or the one with a cute dog. I realize how lonely it would be if I was just dropped in HK without knowing anyone and how scary it will feel to just start over knowing nobody in a new place. Yet also exciting, I felt this in SF where I could be anyone, form my own identity, create my own meaning.\n  - Then realizing it's a Sunday night and I'm standing in Hong Kong people watching\n  - people-watched so much that I lost a sense of being and forgot that I existed for a few minutes, I went into a state of confusion where I forgot I could act in this world. maybe I was just exhausted.\n- Realized how scary it is for the train to go underground under the ocean, what if theres an earthquake and everyone drowns inside\n- They have litter containers where on top of you can dispose of your cigarette bud\n- Not sure how people call taxis here, i went on to the road while the taxi was at a red light and waved at the driver, he rejected at first and then was like, where do you wanna go. also they ask for street road name and number\n- learning that just noting down spots to go and restaurants to try is enough, also just noticing where the crowd is and will bring you to the famous spots.\n- also I can't seem to just enjoy a trip when traveling without obsessive planning and researching, I'm pressured to be in the best spots with nice views and the best (affordable) restaurants, I'm gonna just relax the next few days and appreciate my family, realizing that everything is temporary and every moment with them is precious.\n- once nice thing i'm not stressing out about articles or other work I told myself I had to finish before going to the US, but at the same time it feels like I don't have an identity without those work. what am I without all of that? I am what I do, and if I do them 90% of my day, what am I without them?\n- I think I have social anxiety being in crowded places. can't stop feeling like I'm being judged. maybe it's the past 3 months of being home too much.\n",

Also our tiny hotel room with an even tinier bathroom is 472 per night. I'm not sure if it's HK that's expensive (inflation) or the MYR is weak, maybe it's both.\n- the buildings are old and have striking colors which make good photography shots, I noticed\n- it's really tiring to travel by train because of all the going up and down the stairs and escalators required, and finding the right exits.\n  - sidenote: I like that there can be a dozen exits for a station, this makes it possible to travel underground when it's raining, and makes the station very accessibly in and out.\n- ladies market and sneaker street wasn't that exciting too, I can get shoes cheaper at StockX I think.\n- I found a bookstore but it was all chinese books, I have yet to find an English bookstore\n- Shanghai street is pretty interesting, I went in this building with a lot of cool shops and restaurants. I liked Bunkaya Zakkaten in particular. They had cute and fun items.\n- I think my view of HK was romanticized by [Cherrien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ki1V1VzQNA), as of now I don't really find it nice, maybe I need to get to Central HK and that's where it's more entertaining.\n- I also like the fast pace of HK more, but I have to remember to slow down for my parents who are in their 60s.\n- the rain here gets pretty heavy, I cannot trust weather forecasts anymore I was promised no rain, I didn't get to visit the temple street night market :(\n\nnotes from family:\n\n- my sister: she noticed a lot of girls have branded bags like Chanel (more than KL) and that you can tell HK people from the people from China.\n- my dad: people are rude (pushing others around in subway) whereas in Japan, everyone was courteous\n- my mom: the buildings are old, like a third world country (we were in Apliu street)\n",

    "content": "\nA few notes on [how AI is improving climate forecasts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00780-8).\n\nConventional climate models are built manually from scratch by scientists using mathematical equations to describe the physical processes by which land, oceans, and air interact and affect the climate.\n\nThey're important and are expected to work well enough to make climate projections because they help guide global policy.\n\nThe problem? They take weeks to run and are energy intensive. A typical model consumes up to 10 MW hours of energy to simulate a century of climate. (this is, on average, the amount of electricity used annually by a US household)\n\nThese models also struggle to simulate small-scale processes, like how raindrops form, which have an important role in large-scale weather and climate outcomes.\n\nThe solution? Using ML to spot patterns in the data.\n\nThree ways AI is used for climate modelling\n\n1. Emulators (Copycats)\n   - take baseball, a conventional climate model is a program that calculates where a ball will land based on physical factors, such as how hard a ball is thrown, where it is thrown from, and how fast it is spinning.\n     - What emulators do is equivalent to a sports player who learns the patterns from these modelled outputs, and can make predictions of where the ball will land, without crunching all the math.\n   - two examples\n     - [QuickClim](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01011-0): forecast temperature 1M times faster than a conventional model\n     - [ACE: A fast, skillful learned global atmospheric model for climate prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02074)): accurately predicted 90% of atmospheric variables, 100 times faster and 100 times more energy-efficient\n2. Foundational models\n   - what: picking up hidden patterns, fundamental, possibly unknown, patterns in the data that are predictive of futruefuture climate\n   - [ClimaX: A foundation model for weather and climate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343)\n     - **general training**: Microsoft trained on the output from five physics-based climate models that simulated the global weather and climate from 1850 to 2015, including factors such as air temperature, air pressure and humidity, simulated on timescales from hours to years\n     - **fine-tuning** on wide-range of tasks: one of it (from a [benchmark](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002954) for comparing AI climate models) was predicted the average surface temperature, daily temperature range and rainfall worldwide from input variables of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, black carbon and methane levels\n     - ClimaX predicted state of temperature-related variables better than 3 emulators, but less well in predicting rainfall\n   - limitations:\n     - true state of future climate is unknown: \"Testing climate models against past climate behaviour is useful, but not a perfect measure of how well they can predict a future that’s likely to be vastly different from what humanity has seen before.\"\n     - AI is a black box: “With climate projections, you absolutely need to trust the model to extrapolate,”\n3. Hybrids (best of both)\n   - what: embed ML components inside physics-based models to produce hybrid models\n   - why: ML replaces the parts of conventional models that works less well – typically modelling of small-scale, complex and important processes such as cloud formation, [snow cover](https://clima.caltech.edu/files/2023/04/Snow_Prediction_Paper.pdf), and river flows\n   - example\n     - [A machine learning approach to rapidly project climate responses under a multitude of net-zero emission pathways | Communications Earth & Environment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01011-0)\n\nWhat is the ultimate goal?\n\n> create digital models of Earth's systems, partly powered by AI, that can simulate all aspects of the weather and climate down to kilometre scales, with great accuracy and at lightning speed.\n\n### more\n\nby nature\n\n- [Science and the new age of AI](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-03017-2/index.html)\n- [Think big and model small](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01399-1)\n- [How machine learning could help to improve climate forecasts](https://www.nature.com/articles/548379a)\n- [Harnessing AI and computing to advance climate modelling and prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01769-3)\n\ninteresting projects\n\n- [CliMA – Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.caltech.edu/)\n- [Earth System Digital Twins - NASA Earth Science and Technology Office](https://esto.nasa.gov/earth-system-digital-twin/)\n- [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/): Building a highly accurate digital twin of the Earth\n\nDeepMind\n\n- [GraphCast: AI model for faster and more accurate global weather forecasting](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/)\n- [Nowcasting the next hour of rain](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/nowcasting-the-next-hour-of-rain/)\n- [What is the Deepmind Nowcasting paper all about? | Real-world Machine Learning](https://dramsch.net/articles/deepmind-nowcasting/)\n- [Google DeepMind’s AI Weather Forecaster Handily Beats a Global Standard](https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-ai-weather-forecast/)\n",

    "content": "\nThis video popped up in my feed recently: _[I didn't listen to music for 3 months (a science experiment)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3gwLK5ZVgE)._\n\nAnd I never realized I had a music addiction until now.\n\nIt convinced me to delete spotify from my Macbook and iPhone yesterday.\n\nThroughout the day, I play music endlessly, leaving no room for silence.\n\nI play songs first thing in the morning, while I'm doing work, while I drive, while I'm in the bathroom, and even outside in shopping malls.\n\nMy spotify activity is probably around 6-8 hours a day.\n\nI notice myself being anxious and bored when it's silent and there's no music. My mind would be replaying songs in my head throughout the day and when I got to sleep. I have no pause button for my brain.\n\nNow back to the video.\n\nShe references a study done in 2010 on music addiction, and I feel the same way. I had to have music playing for me to start doing my work. I remember times when I forget my airpods and I would feel like I won't be able to get anything done at all. It was like I was crippled and music was my support system.\n\n> In today's world, music consumption is ubiquitous and it appears that some individuals, especially among younger people, are unable to function effectively in daily life without continued access to their music of choice – [Cockrill et al. 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969698910001207?via%3Dihub)\n\nShe also defines addiction based on three traits\n\n1. craving or compulsion\n2. loss of control\n3. persistence of behaviour despite accruing of negative consequences\n\nsource: [Shaffer et al. 2000](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/h0087741)\n\nShe mentions two benefits of not listening to music all the time from her experiment: heightened presence and emotional clarity\n\nThe first one involved being closer to nature and your environment, and little things like hearing conversations from the people around can make you feel more connected to people instead of blocking out the outside world and live in your own world.\n\nThe second one is the opposite of emotional confusion. She talked about emotional confusion which helped describe what I've been experiencing the past 3 months.\n\nI'm either **numbing** my emotions or I'm just **exaggerating** them with music.\n\nIt made me create problems that aren't real, conjuring sadness out of nothing, and just overall made me not live in the moment.\n\n> \"Listening to sad music induces ambivalent emotion.\"\n>\n> – [Kawakami et al. 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00311/full)\n\nHowever, she's not advocating that we stop listening to music completely, music has [a](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/music-and-health-what-you-need-to-know) [lot](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music) [of](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8566759/) [benefits](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01246/full).\n\n> \"When I hear music, I fear no danger. I am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to the earliest times, and to the latest\" – Henry David Thoreau\n>\n> \"Music is the universal language of mankind.\" – Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\n\nHer advice is to try not listening to music for an hour, a day, or a week if you can and notice how you're feeling. And to be more intentional in listening to music, since we have an unlimited source of music with Spotify, it's easy to overconsume it endlessly.\n\nToday I had this video of [Calcifer in the fireplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGphuanCRDk) playing in the background which I think don't count as music, at least not the music I usually listen to all day long.\n\nAlso, I did work outside of my room without any music, and I finished writing 3 articles today. I was almost too productive today. I got a slight headache afterwards.\n\nSo maybe it's working? I'll need a longer time horizon to tell for sure. Maybe it was a change of my environment. I'll be reporting back in a week.\n",

Even when offered help, I reject it and I want to be alone. I'm not sure how healthy this is. But I think it's because I want to be strong enough to handle it on my own because I won't always have people around me all the time. If I'm dependent on others I fear I won't be able to support myself in difficult moments like this. Perhaps this self-sufficiency is a lie that I'm telling myself, and it's okay to ask for help and receive it.\n\nI just kept letting the pain absolutely paralyze me. I was gasping for air at first. It was really hard to breathe. And I kept regurgitating stomach acid. It was not pleasant. I could barely ingest any water. It felt like I had a ball of glass shards in my throat that was scorching hot, and my body was actively trying to puke out. I could feel the pain in my teeth.\n\nThe whole time I kept asking why this was happening. I wasn’t sure why at the time and it was very disorientating. It’s terrifying to have pain show up and you have no idea why it’s happening or what you can do about it.\n\nI felt anger, then cynical. I was filled with bitterness. Things only started to turn out well, I was eating good food again, and now this had to happen. I felt so demotivated. Like I took two steps forward and three steps back.\n\nThen came fear. What if this happens in the US and I don’t have my family around? What if I’m not able to cope? What if? I was catastrophizing yet again.\n\nI was coping with music, soft and harmonious music. I watched a tv show I liked. I was gripping on things and on myself. I thought about the good moments I had with my friends. They helped distract myself from the pain.\n\nI was thinking about what I should be doing the next time I experience acute pain, so I can cope with it better and learn to control it.\n\nHere are some advice I found:\n\n- focus on pain-free areas: focus on what you can still do\n  - if pain is in your feet, use your hands to draw, write, take pictures\n- think positively: think about what you have – people, good food, roof over our heads\n- distract yourself: walk, pray, talk to friends, go to the movies\n- breathe deeply: concentrate on how you breathe\n- visualize the good: go to your happy place, think about things, places, or people that make you happy\n- understand pain: learning about pain can lower pain volume\n  - pain, your body's warning system, is not an accurate indicator of tissue damage, it is your brain's best guesstimate about how much danger your body is in and how much pain is required to protect it\n\nReferences\n\n- [5 Ways to Take Your Mind off the Pain - Neuropathic Therapy Center | Loma Linda University Health](https://lluh.org/services/neuropathic-therapy-center/blog/5-ways-take-your-mind-pain#:~:text=Think%20about%20the%20things%2C%20places,consumed%20by%20pain%2024%2F7.)\n- [Ten Evidence-Based Strategies for Pain Relief | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pain-explained/202002/ten-evidence-based-strategies-pain-relief)\n",

The Cliffs at Pourville, 1882](/images/seacliff.jpg)\n\nExactly [a year ago](/posts/day-one) I started blogging everyday.\n\nThese blogs are mostly good ideas that I discover online that I want to compartmentalize and steal for myself, and collect them here in my own corner of the internet so I can revisit them from time to time.\n\nAs for my reflective and introspective writings, they're an attempt to document my life and for making sense of my thoughts.\n\n> “Write hard and clear about what hurts. ― Ernest Hemingway\n\nReading back my journal entries in this blog is almost like time travelling.

    "content": "\nI had a chat with [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ichin-han/) who I found on [ADPlist](https://adplist.org).\n\nThe most practical advice I got from him (+ Claude 3 Sonnet) is the following:\n\nWhen assigned a task or analysis, like \"research the relationship between A, B, and C\", ask for additional context upfront:\n\n- Why are we looking at A, B, and C specifically? What is the broader product/business goal?\n- What are the initial assumptions or beliefs on how they relate?\n- Are there other related variables X, Y, and Z that should be considered?\n- Who will be consuming this analysis? What are their perspectives and priorities?\n\nWorking backwards from the end objective helps you obtain enough context so you understand where your specific analysis fits into the bigger picture.\n\nThe rest of the notes are about how to understand data and stuff about quant.\n\n---\n\n## How to understand data\n\n### 1. Gather Structural/Systems Context\n\n> The first critical step is to understand why the data is showing up in a certain way due to the underlying systems, processes and pipelines generating it. This provides the foundational context.\n\n- Ask questions to verify assumptions rather than solely relying on documentation\n- For datasets pulled from production systems you don't own, find out the relationships and expectations between data columns/tables\n- Identify when certain data is expected/not expected to show up based on the systems\n- Understand effects caused by system properties vs. inherent to the phenomenon being studied\n\nThe biggest, most obvious deviations initially uncovered are typically structural issues resulting from mismatched expectations about the systems. Resolving these systematics upfront prevents wasted effort analyzing artifacts.\n\n### 2. Understand Industry/Domain Context\n\n> The next crucial step is to deeply understand the problem domain, entity or industry vertical that the data represents. Every industry has established tenures, benchmarks and behavioral norms.\n\n- Learn the industry standards, rules of thumb or common sayings that reflect accepted domain knowledge (e.g. 95% revenue from 1% whales in gaming)\n- Compare the data against these benchmarks to identify gaps or deviations from expected norms\n- Use findings that contradict popular beliefs as low-hanging fruit to impress stakeholders early on\n\n### 3. Explore Broadly Before Narrowing\n\n> With the structural and domain contexts established, the process moves to open-ended exploratory analysis.\n\n- Writing down a list of hypotheses to test based on the gathered context\n- Time-boxing each hypothesis with a quick 10-15 minute investigation\n- Not lingering too long on any single hypothesis if no interesting leads emerge quickly\n- The goal is to rapidly narrow down to the most promising areas for deeper analysis\n\n### 4. Analyze Promising Areas Deeply\n\n> For the most interesting hypotheses identified during broad exploration, go through through rigorous statistical study to:\n\n- Quantify the size of any effects or opportunities precisely\n- Formulate multiple potential solutions or proposals\n- Estimate the business impact of executing each proposal\n\nThis provides the ammunition to effectively \"sell\" the analytic insights by demonstrating and quantifying the potential upside.\n\n### 5. Validate Findings\n\nEven after penetrating analysis, validate results through additional processes like:\n\n- Holding meetings with subject matter experts to scrutinize assumptions\n- Performing simulations or live experiments if possible\n- Continuously monitoring and measuring impact after implementation\n\nThe combination of upfront context-building, broad gaping analysis, focused deep dives, sizing potential impact, and ongoing validation allows analysts to truly wring comprehensive insights from datasets.\n\n---\n\nTwo main categories of quant back then\n\n1. High-Frequency Trading\n   - Focused on leveraging coding skills to execute trades at ultra-high speeds\n   - Targeted micro price differentials and market microstructure inefficiencies\n   - Highly technical, prioritizing low-latency systems and fast code execution\n2. Statistical Arbitrage/Pricing\n   - Employed robust statistical methods and mathematics\n   - Aimed to identify and profit from longer-term pricing inefficiencies\n   - Could involve forecasting over days, months or even years\n   - More research-oriented analysis\n\nThe divide is narrowing in recent years and ML is being applied more widely across all quant strategies.\n\nEntry level roles\n\n- research analyst working on specific strategies or forecasting algorithms in a niche area.\n- ex: working on modeling weather derivatives. (i.e. a theme park who insures against rainy weekends during peak summer seasons)\n\nCareer paths\n\n- Front office trading roles: Focused on trade execution, higher pressure\n- Portfolio management: Creating and overseeing investment strategies, providing direction to analysts\n\nResources\n\n- [QuantStart](https://www.quantstart.com/)\n- [Self-Study Plan for Becoming a Quantitative Trader](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Self-Study-Plan-for-Becoming-a-Quantitative-Trader-Part-I/)\n- [International Quant Championship 2024 - WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com/iqc/)\n- [WorldQuant University](https://www.wqu.edu/)\n",

And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You appreciate it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.\n>\n> The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying “You’re too this, or I’m too this.” That judging mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.\n>\n> – [Ram Dass on Self Judgment](https://www.ramdass.org/ram-dass-on-self-judgement/)\n\nI notice I'm incredibly judgy when I'm noticing people in shopping malls and on the streets. Maybe I'm just projecting my own insecurities and biases. I don't like doing it but it feels automatic.\n\nThis reminds me of David Brooke's advice on seeing people with generous eyes. The idea of turning people into trees is pretty effective. The person you see in front of you had their own unique mix of genetics, family upbringing and culture, life experiences, pain and suffering, trauma, achievements, and influence from their surroundings that bent them into the shape they are, inside and out. Just observe them and appreciate it. Resist the urge to judge.\n\nWhat's worse is I judge myself too. I notice physical features that I dislike and wish \"I looked more like that\" or \"I'm too that\". It's a bad habit of mine and I think it's a sign of immaturity to not be able to accept the one's flaws. Hopefully, one day, I'll be able to fully accept all parts of myself, and in the process, my insecurities will be cured.\n",

Focus on\n  foundational skills.\n- Follow curiosity and passion - find what feels like work to others that is play to you.\n- Earn with your mind, not your time.\n- 3 types of leverage: labor, money，and permissionless leverage （code, media. Having all 3 -> billion dollar company\n- Spend more making the big 3 decisions:\n  - 1\\) where you live, 2) who you’re with, and 3) what you do\n- Get out of competition trap\n  - Doing the thing you know you’re to do better than anybody. If you love to do it, be authentic, and then figure out how to map that to something society wants.\n  - Apply some leverage and put your name on it. You take the risk but you gain the rewards, have ownership and equity in what you’re doing, and just crank it up\n- Creating business and making money is nor more of an art.\n  - Art is creativity, anything done for is own sake. Creating business is play\n- Build your character in a certain way and it becomes your destiny\n  - Your character and reputation are things you can build, which will let you take advantage of opportunities other people characterize as lucky, but up know it isn’t luck\n- Make interesting things that people want. Shoe your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you\n- On success\n  - Great people have great outcomes. You just have to be patient. Success never happens on the time scale you want, but it does happen\n  - You have to put in the time, put in the hours, put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set you have, to be the best in the world at what you do\n  - You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing it. Don’t keep track, and don’t keep count because if you do, you will run out of time\n- You real resume is the catalog of all your suffering, all the sacrifices you made and the hard things you did.\n- What is wisdom?\n  - Wisdom is knowing the long term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgement\n- Eliminate as many \"should\"s in your life as possible\n- [“Peace is happiness at rest](https://nav.al/peace-motion); happiness is peace in motion.”\n",

Japanese businesspeople are comfortable with 8-second pauses (2x Americans generally tolerate)\n6. do the looping\n   - looping = repeat what someone said to make sure you accurately received what they're trying to project\n   - forces you to listen more carefully\n   - keeps people focused on their core point, rather than drifting away on some tangent.\n   - often times we are interpreting people incorrectly.\n   - ex: if somebody says \"My mother can be a real piece of work\", say \"So you're really pissed at your Mom?\", and pause to see if they agree.\n7. the midwife model\n   - many good conversations are reciprocal (50/50 talk time), but some good conversations are by necessity lopsided.\n   - ex: person A going through a hard time or facing a big life decision, and person B is there to accompany them in the process of deliberation\n   - these conversations are an opportunity to listen to ourselves \"sometimes we can't understand personal truths until we hear ourselves say them\"\n8. keep the gem statement at the center\n   - gem statement = truth underneath the disagreement, something you both agree on\n   - during conflicts, return to the gem statement to keep relationships between people strong.\n9. find the disagreement under the disagreement\n   - instead of trying to make other people see issues the way we do, ask why there's a disagreement in the first place,\n     - what is the **values disagreement** underneath the practical disagreement?\n   - look for moral, philosophical roots for why you each believe what you do -> mutual exploration -> pull stories out of each other\n   - \"Being curious about your friend's experience is more important than being right\" – Lisa Feldman Barrett\n10. don't be a topper\n    - don't try to relate with your own experience, you're just shifting attention back to yourself\n    - to build shared connection, sit with their experience\n\n> The experience of being listened to all the way on something—until your meaning is completely clear to another human being—is extremely rare in life.\n>\n> – Mónica Guzmán\n\n---\n\nSome notes on C7: The Right questions.\n\n- three questions for big picture\n  - ultimate goals (What do you want to offer the world?)\n  - your skills (What are you doing when you feel most alive?)\n  - your schedule (How exactly do you fill your days?)\n- an average child asks 40,000 questions between ages 2-5\n- some point during late childhood or adolescence, we begin to withdraw from intimacy. society sends teh message we shouldn't show emotions, shouldn't get personal\n- simple questions are best. David, as a journalist just asks the same question over and over again: \"And then what happened?\"\n- broad, dumb questions > smart questions (meant to display how well-informed you are)\n- questioning as a **moral practice**\n  - asking a good question requires adopting a posture of humility\n  - you're confessing you don't know and want to learn\n  - you're also honoring a person, you admit you don't know what's going on in their mind\n- the worst questions\n  - questions that don't surrender power (which college, what neighborhood, what do you do?) -> implies \"I'm about to judge you\"\n  - closed questions (instead of \"were you close?\" which limits to close/distant frame, ask \"How is your mother?\" so they can go as deep or as shallow when answering)\n  - vague questions (\"How's it going?\", \"What's up?\") they're another way of saying \"I'm greeting you, but I don't actually want you to answer.\"\n- humble questions are open-ended\n  - they encourage the other person to take control and take the conversation where they want it to go\n  - they begin with \"How did you...,\" \"What's it like...\" \"Tell me about...\" and \"In what ways...\"\n- Good questions\n  - \"Where did you grow up?\"\n  - \"That's a lovely name. How did your parents choose it?\"\n  - \"What's the best way to grow old?\"\n\nFavorite questions to help people see life from a distance\n\n- \"What crossroads are you at?\" At any moment, most of us are in\n  the middle of some transition. The question helps people focus\n  on theirs.\n- \"What would you do if you weren’t afraid?\" Most people know\n  that fear plays some role in their life, but they haven’t clearly\n  defined how fear is holding them back.\n- \"If you died tonight, what would you regret not doing?\"\n- \"If we meet a year from now, what will we be celebrating?\"\n- \"If the next five years is a chapter in your life, what is that\n  chapter about?\"\n- \"Can you be yourself where you are and still fit in?\"\n\nQuestions about the positive sides of life\n\n- \"Tell me about a time you adapted to change.\"\n- \"What's working really well in your life?\"\n- \"What are you most self-confident about?\"\n- \"Which of your five senses is strongest?\"\n- \"Have you ever been solitary without feeling lonely?\"\n- \"What has become clearer to you as you have aged?\"\n\n> Each person is a mystery. And when you are surrounded by mysteries, as the saying goes, it’s best to live life in the form of a question.\n",

When we break out of the rituals and routines that surround our gatherings, embrace the generous authority of being a host, set some rules and encourage people to be their authentic selves, it’s simple to hold gatherings that are meaningful and memorable.\n\nand 8 key ideas + 1 actionable advice\n\n1. give more thought to gatherings\n   - focus less on the mechanics, more on how guests will connect with each other and get something meaningful\n2. commit to a clear purpose\n   - too many gatherings follow ritualized formats, rather than being built around purpose (tradition of baby showers only for women)\n   - think less about the what and more about the why\n   - setting a clear purpose -> decisions about how to organize events + who to invite\n3. be willing to exclude people\n   - we often focus on inclusion (\"the more the merrier\"), but exclusion is just as important, although uncomfortable\n   - exclusion may feel impolite, but **inclusion of the wrong people is a form of impoliteness to other people involved**\n   - narrowing a group brings together an interesting mix of attendees\n4. act with generous authority\n   - rather than being hands-off, run events with authority, but selflessly, in the interests of your guests\n   - act on the behalf of the guests' real interest, rather than their desire for comfort.\n5. rules are liberating\n   - rules take us out of our everyday way of doing things, and injects serendipity and new experiences\n   - in a world of almost indefinite choices, enforcing focus on just one thing is an act of liberation\n6. prime your guests well\n   - people form impressions about what to expect from your event before it starts, prime them with the right expectations\n   - make your guests feel welcome and honored to be there as they arrive\n7. design for authenticity\n   - have guests dwell on their vulnerabilities instead of their achievements and success\n   - two ways to bring authenticity\n     - #1 ask for stories: an interesting story is about vulnerability, risk and emotion. You can't tell an interesting story about how successful you are.\n     - #2 reveal yourself: expose yourself, share something personal, take the lead and others will follow\n8. end with a bang\n   - avoid letting things fizzle out, ensure your gathering is remembered for the right reasons\n   - implement last calls, thank everyone for a wonderful evening and make clear that guests are free to leave, this nudges people towards a clear ending\n\nAdvice: **think carefully about location**\n\n- the best locations are the ones that inspire and embody the true purpose of gatherings\n- break out of your normal spaces, think creatively, for example\n  - college reunions in a cemetery (memento mori)\n  - sales training by spending a day with a subway busker\n",

    "content": "\nI'm on Chapter 3 of Bill Gates' book on climate.\n\nHe talks about how when he started learning about climate change, he kept encountering facts that were hard to wrap his heard around.\n\nThe data he saw often was devoid of context.\n\nIf a program reduces carbon footprint by 17 million tons per year, what does that mean? How much is that? Is that a lot?\n\nSo he built a framework for the things he learned. It helped him figure out how much was a lot and how much was a little, and how expensive something might be.\n\nThis framework consists of five questions.\n\n1. How much of the 52 Billion Tons?\n   - connect everything to the main goal of eliminating 52 billion tons a year\n   - divide X amount of GHG by 52 billion\n   - convert it into a percentage\n   - now you know the big picture goal of how many % of annual global emissions.\n2. What's your plan for cement?\n   - electricity and cars get a lot of attention, but you have to consider everything humans do to cause GHG.\n   - 5 activities\n     - 29%: making things (cement, steel, plastic)\n     - 26%: plugging in (electricity)\n     - 22%: growing things (animal, plants)\n     - 16%: getting around (planes, trucks, cargo ships)\n     - 7%: keeping warm and cool (heating, cooling, refrigeration)\n3. How much power are we talking about?\n   - 1 watt = a big of energy per second\n   - think of it like measuring the flow of water out of a faucet, counting cups that came out per second, measuring power is similar, only you're measuring the flow of energy. Watts is similar to \"cups per second\"\n   - A small incandescent bulb uses 40 watts. A hair dryer uses 1,500. The largest power station in the world: Three Gorges Dam in china produces 22 billion watts\n   - hack\n     - kilowatt: house\n     - gigawatt: city\n     - \\> 100 gigawatt: big country\n4. How much space?\n   - for a given energy source (wind, solar, nuclear) find out how much space will be required to produce that energy\n   - power density: how much power you can get from different sources for a given amount of land (or water) measured in Watts per square meter\n   - examples\n     - fossil fuels (500 - 10,000)\n     - nuclear (500 - 1,000)\n     - solar (5-20)\n     - hydropower(5-50)\n     - wind (1-2)\n     - wood and other biomass (<1)\n5. How much is this going to cost?\n   - moving to cleaner energy sources will cost something, this cost is what he calls **Green Premiums** (GP)\n   - ex: jet fuel\n     - average retail price of jet fuel in USA is $2.22/gallon\n     - advanced biofuel cost $5.35/gallon\n     - green premium for zero carbon fuel `(5.35 - 2.22)/2.22 * 100 = 140%`\n   - Helps answer two questions:\n     - which zero-carbon option to deploy?(the ones with low GP or no premium at all)\n     - where to focus research and development spending, early investors, and best inventors? (wherever the GPs are too high so it makes it more affordable for poorer countries)\n   - it's a measurement system that shows u the progress we're making toward stopping climate change\n",

In 1908, it was [featured](https://www.munchmuseet.no/en/our-collection/5-things-you-should-know-about-the-scream/) as a cover illustration for a book on psychological disorder an art.\n\nDr. Noelle Paulson describes the painting in an essay on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/munch-the-scream)\n\n> Its androgynous, skull-shaped head, elongated hands, wide eyes, flaring nostrils and ovoid mouth have been engrained in our collective cultural consciousness; the swirling blue landscape and especially the fiery orange and yellow sky.\n\nWhat inspired this painting?\n\nA year before he painted this scene, Munch writes this this [entry](https://diariesofnote.com/2023/01/22/a-vast-endless-scream/) in his [journal](https://emunch.no/TRANS_HYBRIDMM_T2760.xhtml)\n\n> Nice 22/1/92\n>\n> I was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting – I felt a wave of sadness – The sky suddenly turned blood-red\n>\n> I stopped, leaned against the fence tired to death – gazed out over the flaming clouds like blood and swords – the blue-black fjord and city – My friends walked on – I stood there quaking with angst – and I felt as though a vast, endless scream passed through nature\n\nHis work had a formative influence on the [Symbolist](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_(arts)?useskin=vector>) and [Expressionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism?useskin=vector) movement. As opposed to [naturalism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(literature)>) and [realism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)>), symbolists and expressionists artists shift the emphasis from the direction representation of nature to the world of the imagination.

    "content": "\nI remember reading Joan Didion's essay [Self-respect: Its Source, Its Power](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961) and being really absorbed by her writing and wanting to write like her.\n\nIn an [excerpt](https://lithub.com/joan-didion-why-i-write/) from her book [Let Me Tell You What I Mean](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53308149), she talks about what a writer is, why she writes, how she develops stories in her books, and about shimmering pictures.\n\nA writer is\n\n> a person whose most absorbed and passionate hours are spent arranging words on pieces of paper.\n\nWhy does she write?\n\n> I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.\n\nShe talks about how she couldn't live in the abstract, and her attention was always veered to the specific, to the tangible, the peripheral. On what she could see, taste, and touch. She has pictures in her mind.\n\n\"Why have the night lights in the Bevatron burned in my mind for twenty years?\" \"Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956?\"\n\nFor her, these images shimmer around the edges.\n\n> Look hard enough, and you can’t miss the shimmer. It’s there. You can’t think too much about these pictures that shimmer. You just lie low and let them develop. You stay quiet. You don’t talk to many people and you keep your nervous system from shorting out and you try to locate the cat in the shimmer, the grammar in the picture.\n\nShe means \"shimmer\" literally, just like how she means \"grammar\" literally\n\n> Grammar is a piano I play by ear, since I seem to have been out of school the year the rules were mentioned. All I know about grammar is its infinite power. To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed.\n\nThese pictures dictate the arrangement and shape of the sentences (active or passive, long or short, ends hard or a dying-fall)\n\n> The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what’s going on in the picture.\n> Nota bene:\n>\n> It tells you.\n>\n> You don't tell it.\n\nWhen starting her book _Play It as It Lays_, she had no notion of characters or plot, but only two pictures. The first was just white space; empty space. The second was a young woman who walks through the casino at the Riviera in Las vegas at one in the morning.\n\nAnd for _A Book of Common Prayer_, she had several pictures, one of them was the Bevatron. Another was a newspaper photograph of a hijacked 707 burning on the desert in the Middle East. Another was the night view from a room where she spent a week with paratyphoid, a hotel room on the Columbian coast. And so on.\n\nI love the idea of writing from pictures in your head, images that shimmer around the edges. Snapshots from your life that you can't get out of your head, the ones that imprints and sears like a tattoo and lifelong scar. And how all these images can coalesce into a story.\n",

[it] starts empty, first thing in the morning, and which you then gradually fill with whatever you accomplish through the day. Each entry is a cheering reminder that you could, after all, have spent the day doing nothing constructive – yet look what you did instead!\n\nAnd it's not just for feeling better about yourself. It helps align you towards the right things to focus on.\n\n> start thinking of each day as an opportunity to move a small-but-meaningful set of items over to your done list, you'll find yourself making better choices about what to focus on. And you’ll make more progress on them, too, because you’ll waste less time and energy being distracted by stress about all the other stuff you're (unavoidably) neglecting.\n\nThe keyword here is small-but-meaningful set of items.\n\nI expect myself to finish big tasks in a day, my three things a day tend to be ambitions and highly unspecific: \"finish app\", \"finish article\", \"start kaggle competition\".\n\nI'm still learning how to break things done, and see these smaller tasks as achievements as well.\n\nAn important factor to building this habit is by making it easy.\n\nI discovered a [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) [extension](https://www.raycast.com/KevinBatdorf/obsidian) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/about) for Raycast that has a command for [appending to daily note](https://github.com/KevinBatdorf/obsidian-raycast#daily-note).\n\nThis makes capturing my completed tasks, TILs, and thoughts super convenient.\n\nAnd also gives me an opportunity to finally start using Obsidian.\n",

    "content": "\nI'm starting April strong with career advice by Marc Andreessen, cofounder of a16z, VC firm in SV.\n\nHe wrote a four part series on career planning below:\n\n- [P0: Introduction](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part0.html)\n- [P1: Opportunity](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part1.html)\n- [P2: Skills and education](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html)\n- [P3: Where to go and why](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part3.html)\n\nbelow are the ideas that struck me.\n\n---\n\n### p1: opportunity\n\n- don't plan your career, career planning = career limiting\n- focus on developing skills and pursuing opportunities\n- opportunities fall into two buckets: 1) those that present themselves to you and 2) those that you go out and create\n  - for 1), they come and go quickly, be alert to them and ready to jump on them\n- look at your career as a portfolio of jobs/roles/opportunities. Each of them has a potential return. When evaluating risk of a new opportunity, look at your entire career and decide whether it fits strategically. If you're young, it's not the time to play it safe. Join startups that optimize for skill development and valuable experiences.\n- working at FAANG = only gaining skills relevant for that particular FAANG / other big companies\n\n> The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.\n\n> What I listen for is someone who really wanted something that could be obtained only through taking the risk, whether that risk was big or small.\n> – Aaron Brown\n\n> Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think...\n> – Nassim Taleb\n\n### p2: skills\n\n- the best way to maximize your impact on the world is to continuously develop and broaden your base of skills\n- <mark>become very good (top 25%) at [two or more things](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html)</mark>\n- make yourself rare by combining two or more \"pretty goods\" until no one else has your mix\n- All successful CEOs are top 25% in a set of the following skills: product vision, sales, marketing, finance, manager, technical, etc.\n- five skills to focus on\n  - 1\\) **communication**: become good public speakers. you'll have a hard time changing the world if you can't communicate well.\n  - 2\\) **management**: learn how to manage people. best way is to learn from a great manager\n  - 3\\) **selling**: getting people to do/want things by offering them something they should want or don't realize they want.\n    - this can help you recruit, raise money, talk to investors, create business partnerships, and even help in your relationships\n  - 4\\) **finance**: financial theory, financial statements, budgeting and planning, corporate structure, equity and debt markets\n  - 5\\) **international**: spend time in other countries and other cultures\n- <mark>get into the real world and really challenge yourself, expose yourself to risk, put yourself in situations where you'll succeed or fail by your own decisions and actions, and where that success or failure will be highly visible.</mark>\n\n> If you're going to be a high achiever, you're going to be in lots of situations where you're going to be quickly making decisions in the presence of incomplete or incorrect information, under intense time pressure, and often under intense political pressure. You're going to screw up -- frequently -- and the screwups will have serious consequences, and you'll feel incredibly stupid every time. It can't faze you -- you have to be able to just get right back up and keep on going.\n>\n> That may be the most valuable skill you can ever learn. Make sure you start learning it early\n\n### p3: where and why\n\n- pick an industry where founders of the industry are still alive and actively involved\n- be in an industry where there is a lot of growth and change and flux and opportunity.\n- Never worry about being a small fish in a big pond. Being in the opposite means you'll hit the ceiling on what you can achieve quickly and nobody will care.\n- <mark>optimize at all times for being in the most dynamic and exciting pond you can find.</mark>\n- which company? go to the one where all the action is happening.\n- starting a company? aim at the largest and most interesting market\n- which startup? look for one where you understand teh product, see how it might fit into a very large market, and really like and respect the people who are already there\n- <mark>Every job, every role, every company you go to is an opportunity to learn how a business works and how an industry works.</mark>\n\n> Think strategically: how would I start a firm like this today? Or, if I were starting a company in this industry today, how would it be different than this firm? Why is this firm and other firms in this industry doing what they do? What are the assumptions underneath their behavior? Should those assumptions be changing? How might this industry work differently? Which customers are being underserved? What new technologies might change things completely? How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now? And, my favorite: if the creators of this industry were starting out today, what would they be doing now?\n",

    "content": "\n![Coucher de soleil, ciel orange, Felix Vallotton, 1900](/images/sunset1900.jpg)\n\nThe past 3 months have been a been a lot of change.\n\nI harbored messy, intertwined strings of emotions coming [back home](/posts/backhome), and upon shining a light on them, they started to take shape [a month later](/posts/malaysia).\n\nIt was a time of anxiety, [fear](/posts/022424), and uncertainty about my future, mainly two questions lingered in my brain \"was coming back the right choice and would this surgery cure me?\" and \"will I be back in the US again?\"\n\nI came back to deal with my health issues, so it was week after week of doctors appointments. I would visit 3 doctors across 3 hospitals in the same week. There was pain and [suffering](/posts/worthy), medications and dietary changes, frustration and resentment, gratitude for the treatments, guilt about the cost of self-pay treatments.\n\nIn between the doctor's appointments and operations, I got to see old faces from high school, spend more quality time with my family, dive into rabbit-holes the entire day on blogs and YouTube, obsessively learning about photography and art, reading books I like.\n\nHowever, as a person who expects a lot from himself, the main theme that revolves around my time so far is expectations, low output, and the dizziness of freedom.\n\n### tiredness and guilt\n\nMost of the past 92 days I was lethargic. If you read my journal entries you will find the word \"tired\" in probably 90% of them. It could be the result of all these changes I went through.\n\nIt's a deep sense of tiredness where your heart feels so heavy that you're paralyzed, rendered immobile. It takes insurmountable amounts of effort to channel the slightest bit of will and energy to do anything, like you're trying to push a wall. It's also the headaches and migraines where it feels like you're brain is on fire and you're staring at the sun. I loathe those days.\n\nMost days I will barely get anything done. I would find myself anxiously switching between tasks, and flinch away from the hard things, and pick the easier, unimportant tasks to finish first, which ends up taking more time that I expected.\n\nI suspect it's also about being home all the time. I generally am more productive when I'm out of the house. So on one hand while I do enjoy being home, because there's not much out there, a switch in my environment helps a lot. Interestingly, this doesn't apply at night. Most nights I get into flow. Flow is incredibly rare from the moment I wake up until 9 p.m. It only happens when I find an interesting project to work on.\n\nThis low output the past few months translated into guilt. I felt guilty about not doing **enough**. I had no school or work responsibilities that would steal away my limited time and energy for passion projects and interests.\n\nIt should be the dream. The entire day, week, and month, free to work on whatever I want. I don't have to worry about food or expenses. I just had to focus on learning and building. Arielle's [syllabus](https://ariellelok.com/sidepages/2023syllabus/fall2023syllabus.html) was what I had in mind. But this freedom is dangerous without setting the right expectations, proper planning, and convictions in your ideas.\n\nI found myself constantly asking the questions \"Is this _really_ the right thing to work on?\", out of the 10 other ideas I want to execute on, which one will increase my [surface area of luck](/posts/lucksurfacearea).\n\nI've been feeling pressured to achieve success (whatever this means). Especially after the fact that I only have the masters as the option, which in total, costs ~$75k USD for a year. I feel like I'm getting this my way too easily, and I'm planning my life too much. There could be other paths for me that are at least as, or possible even more fulfilling. I hope I'm choosing the right path.\n\n### solutions?\n\nPerhaps it's the redefinition of what productivity means for me personally. I recently learned that I should only expect [4 hours](/posts/4hours) of focused, productive work. And I should do everything I can to protect those hours. Being home the entire day, I expect myself to achieve a lot more, since I have no other obligations. This leads to burnout and frustration.\n\nI also need to do better at sticking to the right systems and habits and not rely on motivation and energy levels. That means tasks that I perform automatically, like writing this blog. I have to write this before I sleep. Unless I'm sick (like yesterday) or I'm travelling, I will not got to bed without updating this blog. I need systems in place like that for learning AI, building and coding, and studying other difficult things that increase my cognitive load.\n\nIt's also my inability to schedule time effectively and commit to my time blocks. I created a schedule and time blocked down to the hour at the beginning of January, and I did not even make it past the first few days. It's really hard to plan my time when I work on things impulsively, like I can come up with a project idea and just decide to work on that for the entire day. And put aside the articles and other learnings I have to do. I guess it's hard because the things I work on usually can't be packed into a time block, they always take longer than I expect, and it ties to my inability to stop working on something that consumes me. I'm going to try implementing the system of month, week, day scheduling, which can help me decide just 3 things to work on for a given day, and scheduling that into my day. Then document what I achieved.\n\nI also had a lot of uncertainty about what to focus on and to spend most of my time on. I believe I have a clearer picture of what to achieve now, and maybe it's less about thinking or planning my way out of this, and just being biased towards building and creating, and saying no to more things.\n\n---\n\nSince I'm at a midpoint of my time here in Malaysia before I go back for grad school in July, I thought it would be a good time to review the highlights and reorient myself towards where I want to go next.\n\n### January: 🌊 🦷\n\n- chatted with hudzah & kelly about [Luminary](https://lu.ma/luminarykl)\n- started a [tweet thread](https://x.com/benxneo/status/1743458106032488839?s=20) for 100 days of Swift\n- decorated my [room](https://x.com/benxneo/status/1752312760359350575?s=20)\n- in my \"adopting a cat\" and plants phase\n- did my [third endoscope](/posts/endoscope)\n- extracted [8 teeth](/posts/8teeth)\n\n### February: 👨‍💻 😬\n\n- built [jiji](https://benneo.notion.site/jiji-AI-quizzes-69ac68c5b6a8414b9a49c6610209d960?pvs=4) with SwiftUI\n- went Port Dickson for CNY\n- wrote an AI roadmap that went [viral](https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/a-roadmap-to-learn-ai-in-2024-cc30c6aa6e16)\n- got [braces](/posts/braces)\n\n### March: 🏥 📸\n\n- did [surgery](/posts/surgeryday)\n- got offered to USF (rejected everywhere else so far)\n- 📸 📹: [Fujifilm x100s](/posts/fujifilm), Panasonic sd100, Sony Cybershot DSC TX1\n- reached 1k on Twitter\n- worked on [embedcurius](/posts/1700articles)\n- went to Penang, Johor, and Malacca\n- made a [vlog](https://youtu.be/UspZDzSWfjI) using DaVinci Resolve\n- started coffee chats on [lunchclub](https://lunchclub.com) met a few interesting humans\n\n### lessons + thoughts\n\n- I'm surprised by how fast time passes, the days felt long but these few months really flew by, and I don't feel like I achieved much. Committing to a TIL and done list is crucial to solving this. I should keep a document on my computer at all times for dumping this.\n- I need to do better at committing to hard things, I get overwhelmed by difficult topics and expect them to be easy and can be quickly done in a day, and find myself avoiding them instead of doing a little day by day. I should reimplement the practice of working on the hardest thing in the morning, and set 4 hours for learning and coding AI.\n- I also need to balance productivity and spending quality time with family. My time with them is limited, especially the shopping malls and lunches with my mom, I should always see with the lens of \"this is not forever, you don't know when is the last time, appreciate it while you can\". It's hard to train this, it requires constant reminders.\n- I've undergone all the big changes I had to go through, so now it's all about recovering, adjusting, and focusing on becoming better. I'm not limited like I was before anymore. I can't complain or sulk anymore.\n- I had certain people on my mind a lot the past few months, and it's pretty distracting. I need to spend more time reflecting and analyzing why. And not be afraid of facing these emotions. It could also be me clinging on to the past and my fear of letting go, or whether I should even let go. There's a lot of internal conflict and duality going on. This feeling of incompleteness and longing can get pretty debilitating. I suppose with time, this gets better.\n\n### failures\n\n- wrote a few low-quality articles on Medium, optimizing on output = lower quality\n- stopped Swift learning habit\n- didn't start learning AI until today, I wrote that roadmap but didn't act on it myself, pretty hypocritical\n- didn't get Rundown AI writing gig, someone else with a lot of followers on Twitter got it, I need to start posting good content on Twitter more\n- couldn't rest properly after surgery, wasn't sure when was the right time to start doing work again, and felt like a failure not doing work, which in itself is a failure for not recognizing I still need rest.\n- never interviewed with Pantas, because I want to work on my own things and also focus on learning.\n- didn't put any effort into expanding Luminary\n\n### The next 3 months\n\nhabits to build\n\n- 3 things a day + done list + TIL everyday on Obsidian\n- exercise and eating (60kg before going to US)\n- start to cook and make meals (so I don't starve in SF)\n- 4 hours for learning + coding (by noon)\n- few hours at night for building\n- reading before bed (just 15 min will do)\n\nthings i'm looking forward to\n\n- shenzhen + hong kong trip (maybe Taiwan hopefully)\n- getting HP hardware and gaming + using GPUs (but not looking forward to Windows)\n- eating more good food as I slowly recover\n- taking more photos + making vlogs\n- learning Lightroom\n\nluminary\n\n- reach out to more people\n- collaborate with existing communities\n- set targets and find person to handover before leaving.\n- 100 days of Swift (build Umi and Hikasa)\n\ncoding\n\n- Code the youtube2article app with Wei\n- Google AI Hackathon\n- Cuepal project mentorship\n- lablab.ai hackathons\n\nAI\n\n- minitorch\n- Kaparthy lectures\n- fast.ai\n- finetuning LLMs\n- LLM evals and AI agents\n- kaggle competitions\n",

White](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/10/24/e-b-white-on-the-future-of-reading-1951/)\n\n> I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? [...] We need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. <mark>A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.</mark>\n>\n> – [Franz Kafka](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/06/kafka-on-books-and-reading/)\n\n> By the time I was thirteen I had read myself out of Harlem [...] What I had to do then was bring the two things together: the possibilities the books suggested and the impossibilities of the life around me. Dickens meant a lot to me, for example, because there was a rage in Dickens which was also in me [...] Something I recognized without knowing what I recognized.\n>\n> – [James Baldwin](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/10/a-rap-on-race-james-baldwin-reading/)\n\n> What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. <mark>A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.</mark>\n>\n> Books are like seeds; they can lie dormant for centuries, but they may also produce flowers in the most unpromising soil. These books are the repositories of the knowledge of our species, and of our long evolutionary journey. These books are capable of propelling you to unimaginable heights of success.\n>\n> If I were to read a book a week for my entire adult lifetime, and I lived an ordinary lifetime, when I was all done, I would have read maybe a few thousand books, no more. In this library, that's from about here, roughly, to about here. That's only a tenth of a percent or so of the total number of books in the library. The trick is to know which books to read.\n>\n> – Carl sagan from the [11th episode of Cosmos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8khZZNGjafc), \"The Persistence of Memory\"\n\n## reading lists I've collected over time\n\nfrom people\n\n- [mine](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/103179068)\n- [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/books?curius=2790)\n- [Carl Sagan](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/07/11/carl-sagan-reading-list/)\n- [Sharif Shameem](https://sharif.io/bookshelf?curius=2790)\n- [Derek Sivers](https://bookshelf.so/sivers)\n- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/library?curius=2790)\n- [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/reading/?curius=2790)\n- [Michael](https://akilian.com/books?curius=2790)\n- [Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/books/?curius=2790)\n- [James Somers](https://jsomers.net/?curius=2790#books)\n- [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/now-reading/?curius=2790)\n- [Susan Rigetti](https://www.susanrigetti.com/reading-list?curius=2790)\n- [Stepan Parunashvili](https://www.zeneca.io/stopa?curius=2790)\n- [more!](https://nabeelqu.co/reading-lists)\n\nlists\n\n- [Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World?useskin=vector) ([image](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/4chanlit/images/4/48/StartWithHowToReadABookv24MB.png/revision/latest?cb=20200731150209))\n- [Design books for non-designers](https://www.stripe.press/recommended/design-books.html?curius=2790)\n- [Most Recommended Books | Good Books](https://www.goodbooks.io/top-100/all-books?curius=2790)\n- [1000 books to read before you die!](https://www.1000bookstoread.com/?curius=2790)\n- [bookpickings from The Marginalian](https://bookpickings.themarginalian.org/)\n",

After having lunch, a nap, and a walk, he would start another one-hour period.\n- Henri Poincaré: did his hardest thinking between 10 a.m. and noon, and again between five and seven in the afternoon.\n- G. H. Hardy: from nine to one would be immersed in mathematics, spending the rest of his time walking and playing tennis\n- And many others: Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, Ingmar Bergman, as explained in Alex Pang's book [_Rest_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29502354).\n\nThe lesson here is not to slack off once your four hours are up, and spend time watching the latest TV Show or scrolling Twitter.\n\nIt's about using whatever freedom you have over your day not to \"maximize your time\", but specifically to <mark>protect four hours of undisturbed focus, ideally when your energy levels are highest.</mark>\n\nIt's also to internalize the lesson that it's not possible to demand yourself more than four hours of high-quality mental work.\n\nWe're all living in a burnout society that demands too much of us, leaving no time for rest.\n\nAnd we're becoming people who do not want to rest – who gets antsy when we don't feel like we're productive enough – pushing us beyond our limits, when doing less would've been more productive in the long run.\n\nThe valuable skill here to master isn't to push yourself harder, but <mark>knowing when to stop</mark>.\n\nTo resist the temptation of squeezing in a bit more work, and log off instead, go for a walk, read a good book, chat with your friends and family, pursue your hobbies, and actually live life.\n\nAnd to know that you'll never achieve the feeling of \"in control\" or \"on top of everything\". And that's the reality of life.\n",

    "content": "\n![The Night Watch, Rembrandt van Rijn, 1642](/images/nightwatch.jpg)\n\nLast year when I visited museums in Boston and Seattle, I was always in a time crunch since I was only in the city for a few days, so I never had the luxury to _really_ look at art. To contemplate and deeply study an artwork, sitting with whatever emotion that bubbled up from within me, whether good or bad.\n\nHopefully when I'm back in the U.S., I will have time to visit the museums there and take the time to appreciate art.\n\nBut how should we look at art?\n\n[Courtney Tenz](https://www.vox.com/authors/courtney-tenz) presents us with three ways in this Vox [article](https://www.vox.com/even-better/24071171/how-to-look-at-art).\n\n1. Look at art as an **interactive adventure**\n   - instead of asking \"what does this even mean?\", look past its physical, artistic qualities, and focus on your response to it (memories, emotions)\n   - Surrealist belief: meaning is derived from the triangulation of (1) the work itself, (2) the artist's intention, and the viewer's response to it.\n   - <mark>\"There are no right or wrong ways of reading a piece, only ideas that can be expanded.\"</mark>\n   - [Molly Ovenden](https://mollyovenden.com/): \"It's more about an openness to a conversation... or an invitation to an experience\"\n2. Be open to sitting with discomfort\n   - art can give rise to feelings we aren't in touch with everyday like awe, melancholy, and transcendence\n   - the role of an artist is to convey ideas with honesty, and truthful art can make people wildly uncomfortable\n   - [Susanne K. Langer](https://doi.org/10.2307/3331349) on art and emotions\n     > teaching art is an education in feeling; when art gives rise to emotions we do not always have access to, it can feel too tough to manage. Yet it is in grappling with those emotions that the connection to art – and, ultimately, understanding it – is forged.\n   - Ovenden: \"How do you teach a willingness to be uncomfortable?\"\n3. Notice glimmers of your own experience\n   - [Barry](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/12/01/lynda-barry-on-picture-this/) on art as proof of catharsis.\n     > That’s what the arts do. In the course of human life we have a million phantom-limb pains — losing a parent when you’re little, being in a war, even something as dumb as having a mean teacher — and seeing it somehow reflected, whether it’s in our own work or listening to a song, is a way to deal with it.\n   - think about arts as a way of transforming time or transforming your experience – move beyond the surface response of \"this is a nice picture\" or \"this is a picture that sucks\"\n   - art, like [Vermeer](https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer), can portray the beauty of everyday moments, inspiring you to look at your life anew.\n\n---\n\n10 [questions](https://the-how-to.tumblr.com/post/29266313362/how-to-spend-time-with-a-work-of-art) to ask and answer for yourself when standing in front of a work of art by Nicole Haroutunian, a Museum Educator.\n\n1. Form a couple of first impressions from a few feet away. Ask yourself, what is going on here? What do you see that makes you think that?\n2. Step closer. How does the work of art change as you move towards it? Are there details you didn’t notice before?\n3. Close your eyes and picture the work of art. What stands out in your memory? Open your eyes and compare—was it the colors you recalled? A specific form or shape? Are there any elements you didn’t recall? Why might that have been?\n4. What is the tone or mood of the work of art? Does it have a point of view?\n5. How would it feel if you could touch it—both the actual object and what is being portrayed? Name the textures. What sounds, smells or tastes could you associate with it?\n6. If the work is narrative, imagine it as the center panel in a comic strip or story board. What might have happened five minutes earlier? Five minutes later?\n7. Look to each side and notice the works of art installed beside the one you are studying. What do they have in common? Is there a thematic or stylistic resonance you can pick up on? How are they different?\n8. Does the artwork remind you of anything in another medium—a song, a movie, a book or a poem?\n9. If you were to describe the work of art to someone who could not see it, what would you say? If you only had one sentence to describe it, what would that be? What about only three words?\n10. Only after you’ve spent time exploring the work for yourself, read the label or wall text. Does the information you learn change the way you think about the artwork? If so, how? If not, why not?\n\n---\n\n### more resources\n\nblogs\n\n- [What Artists Notice](https://stopa.io/post/294): noticing small details in Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Portrait” and Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus”\n- [Spending an Hour with Vermeer’s Sleeping Maid — Marina Gross-Hoy](https://www.marinagrosshoy.com/blog/sleeping-maid)\n- [How to look at a painting | The Arts Society](https://theartssociety.org/arts-news-features/how-look-painting) get up close, spend time contemplating a painting to collect visual details, and lean into the canvas (look for gaps or thin areas of paint)\n- [How Long Do You Need to Look at a Work of Art to Get It? | Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-long-work-art-it): spoiler alert it's 20 minutes\n- [How to Look at Art](https://jumpmag.co.uk/look-at-art/): just look, make up stories, share your thoughts with other people\n\nA great book on how we view art\n\n- [Ways of Seeing by John Berger](https://www.ways-of-seeing.com/)\n",

    "content": "\n![Two Men Contemplating the Moon, Caspar David Friedrich, 1825](/images/twomen.jpg)\n\n> friends are the finest and most beautiful adornment of life.\n\nToday, I read this little book on friendship by Marcus Tullius Cicero titled _De Amicitia_ or _How to Be a Friend_.\n\nCicero dedicated this short essay to his best friend, Atticus. Cicero was devoted to Roman politics during the first century BC, a time of civil war, while Atticus watched from a safe distance in Athens. They exchanged letters over the years that displayed a friendship of rare devotion and warm affection.\n\nHe was influenced by Plato and Aristotle who wrote about friendship centuries before, and his work serves as a compelling guide to finding, keeping, and appreciating the people in our lives we value not what they can give us, but because we find in them a kindred soul.\n\nThe book contains 10 timeless advice on friendship:\n\n1. there are **different types of friends**: be they business associates, neighbors, or acquaintances, the rare friends we bind ourselves to on a much deeper level are the ones that deeply change our lives, just as we change theirs.\n2. only **good people** can be true friends: people of poor moral character can only have friends of utility. real friendship requires trust, wisdom, and basic goodness.\n3. **choose friends** with care: take our time, move slowly, discover what lies deep in a person's heart before we make the investment of self that true friendship requires.\n4. **friends make you better**: a true friend challenges you to become better because they appreciate the potential inside you\n5. **make new friends, keep the old**: always be open to new friendships, including younger people. no one is a sweeter friend than someone who's been with you from the stat, cherish and maintain them\n6. friends are **honest** with each other: friends always tell you want you need to hear, not what you want them to say. only a real friend will risk your anger by telling you the truth.\n7. reward of friendship is the friendship itself: there are practical advantages to friendship – advice, companionship, support in difficult times, but at its heart true friendship does not keep score or seek repayment\n8. a friend never asks another friend to do something wrong: a friend will risk much for another, but not honor. friendship is based on good ness, it cannot exist if evil is expected of it.\n9. friendships change over time: all of us change with time, but core values and qualities that formed the friendship survives the test of time. Like fine wine, the best of friendships improve with age.\n10. **without friends, life is not worth living**: \"Suppose a god carried you far away to a place where you were granted an abundance of every material good nature could wish for, but denied the possibility of ever seeing a human being. Wouldn't you have to be as hard as iron to endure that sort of life? Wouldn't you, utterly alone, lose every capacity for joy and pleasure?\"\n\n---\n\nbelow are a few quotes that I liked from the book.\n\n### on death of Atticus\n\n> We shared all our public and private cars, we lived together in the same home, soldiered together in the same campaigns, and enjoyed the very essence of friendship – a common set of beliefs, aspirations, and opinions.\n>\n> I am deeply moved by the death of a friend such as I will never have again, or I least such as I never had before.\n>\n> If the recollections and memories of such things had died with him, I wouldn't be able to bear the loss of a man so near and dear to me. But these experiences are not dead. To the contrary, as I reflect on and remember our time together, the memories are nourished and strengthened.\n>\n> If you let your sorrow overwhelm you, you're not showing how much you loved your friend, only how much you love yourself.\n\n### On divinity of the soul\n\n> Socrates [...] always maintained that human souls were divine. He believed that when the soul left the body, the road back to the heavens lay before it – with the easiest path awaiting souls that were most virtuous and just.\n\n### on friendship\n\n> friendship is nothing other than agreement with goodwill and affection between people about all things divine and human. With teh exception of wisdom, I'm inclined to believe that the immortal gods have given nothing better to humanity than friendship.\n>\n> How can live be worth living, as Ennius says, unless it relies on the mutual goodwill of a friend?\n>\n> What could be sweeter than to have someone you can dare to talk to about everything as if you were speaking to yourself? How could you enjoy the good times of life if you didn't have someone who was as happy about your good fortune as you are? And adversity would be a terrible thing to bear unless you had someone who felt its weight even more than you?\n>\n> All things in nature and indeed the whole universe, whether stationary or in motion, are held together by friendship and torn apart by discord.\n>\n> friendship arises from nature itself rather than from any need, along with an inclination of the soul joined with a sense of love rather than a calculation of how useful the relationship might be.\n>\n> real friendship cannot be the child of poverty and need\n>\n> friends are the finest and most beautiful adornment of life.\n\n### on loyalty\n\n> the foundation of stability and constancy that we seek in a friendship is loyalty, for nothing can be stable that is disloyal. We also need to choose a friend who is honest, sociable, and sympathetic – that is, someone who is motivated by the same things as we are. All these things contribute to loyalty between people.\n\n### on principles of friendship.\n\n> first, never to lie or deceive (for a geniuine man disagrees openly with a friend rather than hiding his real thoughts),\n>\n> second, always to reject slander brought by another and not even to be suspicious or believe that a friend has done something wrong.\n>\n> In addition, there should be a certain pleasantness of speech and actions between two people that gives a special flavor to friendship. [...] friendship ought to be more amiable, genial, and relaxed so it tends towards sociability and ease of every sort.\n\n### on helping your friends (and family)\n\n> if you have an advantage in virtue or talent or fortune, you should share it freely with your family and those you are close to.\n>\n> If your parents are of humble birth or your relatives are not as gifted as you are in brains, energy, or fortune, you should increase their resources and improve their honor and standing in life.\n>\n> For the fruit of talent, virtue, or any other excellence we might have is best enjoyed when shared it with those nearest an dearest to us.\n>\n> someone who is superior ought to bring himself down to the level of his friends and try to raise them up when he can.\n>\n> Only give them what they can handle. [...] even if you can do a great deal for your friends, you have to always consider how much help would do them any good.\n\n### on the most beautiful kind of friendship\n\n> the most beautiful and natural kind of friendship, the one sought in and for itself.\n>\n> Every person loves himself, not for any kind of profit he can make from this love but because he is dear to himself on his own account.\n>\n> Unless we can transfer this kind of feeling to friendship, we will never find true friendship.\n>\n> A friend is, quite simply, another self.\n\n### on choosing the right friends\n\n> you should love after you have judged, not judge after you have loved\n>\n> we pay the price for negligence in many things, but most of all our carelessness in selecting and making friends\n\n### on caring more about friendship\n\n> take great care in forming friendships in teh first place so that we don't begin to love someone we might someday hate\n>\n> our carelessness regarding something as important as friendship deserves the strongest condemnation, for it is the one thing in human life that everyone unanimously agrees is useful\n>\n> one way or another, friendship creeps into every life and allows no way of living without it\n\n### on not letting friends become enemies\n\n> nothing is more disgraceful than to wage war against someone you once loved\n>\n> first make a great effort to see that discord doesn't arise between you and your friends. But if it does, make it seem that the fire of your friendship burned out on its own rather than being stamped out.\n>\n> don't love too quickly and don't give your friendship to those unworthy of it.\n\n### on truth and criticism\n\n> listen to the advice and criticism of a friend when given in a spirit of goodwill.\n>\n> Truth can be troublesome if it brings about hatred, which is poison to friendship but much worse is the kind of indulgence and acquiescence that allows a friend to rush headlong into destructive behaviour.\n>\n> some people's most bitter enemies are more helpful to them than their sweet-seeming friends, since the former often tell the truth but the latter never do.\n>\n> to graciously give and receive criticism is the mark of true friendship. You must offer your corrections with kindness, not harshly, and take them patiently, not with reluctance.\n\n### on virtue\n\n> It is virtue that creates and preserves friendships. Virtue is the source of compatibility, stability, and permanence. When virtue has raised itself up and shown its light and has seen the same light in someone else, it is drawn to that person and receives what it gives another. From this sharing either love [amor] or friendship [amicitia] shines forth, for they both come from the same word [amare]. To love someone simply means that you care for another person without putting your own needs or advantage first. Yet this blossoms in friendship anyway, even though you weren't actively pursuing it.\n",

They live to create and they create to live.\n\nMatisse talks about vision. Creation begins with vision.\n\nSeeing, noticing, paying attention to the right things all requires effort.\n\nHe warns us of the endless influx of digital noise that can distort our ways of seeing, like how news and media generates biases for the mind, causing us to unconsciously focus on certain ideas more than others.\n\n> To see is itself a creative operation, requiring an effort. Everything we see in our daily life is more or less distorted by acquired habits.\n\nThis effort to see things without distortion requires courage. And this courage is essential to the artist.\n\nYou have to look at everything as though it was the first time: looking at life as you did when you were a child.\n\nIf you don't have this ability, you cannot express yourself in an original (personal) way.\n\n> Nothing, I think, is more difficult for a true painter than to paint a rose because, before he can do so, he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted.\n\nThe first step in creation is to see things for what they truly are, and this requires constant effort. To create is to express what is within ourselves.\n\n> Every creative effort comes from within\n\nTo cultivate this, the artist has to assimilate the external world within himself, projecting the inner on to the canvas, until his drawing becomes a part of him.\n\n> When I paint a portrait, I come back again and again to my sketch, and every time it is a new portrait that I am painting: not one that I am improving, but a quite different one that I am beginning over again; and every time I extract from the same person a different being.\n\nAn artist's work becomes really creative when he creates a habit of taking from his surroundings, everything that can feed his creative vision, either directly or by analogy.\n\nHe has to filter and select from all possible combinations and not accumulate details. He has to find \"the line that expresses most and gives life to the drawing\" and \"the equivalent terms by which the facts of nature are transposed into art\"\n\nHe thus concludes that a work of art is the \"climax of long work of preparation\".\n\nRecounting his experience painting [In my Still Life with Magnolia](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/oeuvre/Y5BlJZ2), where he states that the secret of creation lies in the play and balance of colors and lines.\n\nAnd his [chapel at Vence](https://www.theartpilgrim.org/pilgrimages-2/the-chapelle-du-rosaire-de-vence), where the color and light, every line and every detail, gives an impression of boundless space.\n\nThis is how art imitates nature.\n\n> That is the sense, so it seems to me, in which <mark>art may be said to imitate nature, namely, by the life that the creative worker infuses into the work of art</mark>. The work will then appear as fertile and as possessed of the same power to thrill, the same resplendent beauty as we find in works of nature.\n\nHe ends with the precondition of love for creation.\n\n> Great love is needed to achieve this effect, a love capable of inspiring and sustaining that patient striving towards truth, that glowing warmth and that analytic profundity that accompany the birth of any work of at. <mark>But is not love the origin of all creation?</mark>\n",

It sparked fires at telegraph offices and shocked operators. And auroras were visible in low-altitude places like Hawaii.\n\nA solar storm of that magnitude today would be a catastrophe. Satellites, communication networks, and the power grid could all be destroyed. And if this happens in winter, there wouldn't be any power at all.\n\nOne agency estimates the cost of disruptions and repairs after such a severe storm could reach [$2 trillion](https://doi.org/10.17226/12507).\n\nNow researchers are studying [ancient text](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/inside-the-quest-to-find-evidence-of-auroras-in-ancient-texts-180983844/), to build a more accurate understanding of the solar cycle.\n\nThey identified the earliest known aurora in the [Chinese Bamboo Annals](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2022.01.010), which dates to the tenth century B.C.E.\n\nThis is vital as we're approaching a period when the sun's magnetic field will be unstable and solar storms will be more frequent, which scientists call a [Solar maximum](https://www.space.com/solar-maximum-in-sight-but-scientists-will-have-to-wait-seven-months-after-it-occurs-to-officially-declare-it). It's predicted to happen sometime in 2025.\n\nUnearthing historical observations can help us figure out whether what we observe now is unusual, or just the sun doing it's thing.\n\n\"The past is the key to the present (and future)\"\n",

    "content": "\n![The Passion of Creation by Leonid Pasternak](/images/creation.jpeg)\n\n> Your job as a writer is making sentences.\n>\n> Your other jobs include fixing sentences, killing sentences, and arranging sentences.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book.\n\nI like how the author describes writing as making sentences.\n\nIt's a book I will come back to once in a while in my journey of writing, revising, and rewriting.\n\nIt changed my outlook on what writing is all about. I like the fresh ideas of composing and revision being the same thing, the importance of thinking, noticing, noticing what I notice, paying attention to my emotions, self-authorizing in writing, reading to examining the shape and rhythm of sentences and not to extract meaning, reading aloud to revise, not planning or outlining work, and many more.\n\nBelow are some practical questions for writing that are answered from the book, for my reference.\n\n### how to start?\n\nKnow what each sentence says.  \nWhat it doesn't say,  \nAnd what it implies.\n\n### how we know nearly everything?\n\nThe ways we know nearly everything about the world around us.\n\n1. what you've been taught\n2. what you assume is true because you've heart it repeated by others\n3. what you feel, no matter how subtle\n4. what you don't know\n5. what you learn from your own experience\n\nyou don't have to write short sentences forever. Only until you find a compelling reason for a long sentence that's as clear and direct as a short sentence\n\n### how to rewrite?\n\n- keep the space between the period and the subject as empty as possible\n  - this space gets filled with unnecessary words\n  - most sentences need no preamble - or postlude\n- remove every unnecessary word\n  - see which words the sentence can live without\n  - every word is optional until it proves to be essential\n  - remove words one by one and see what's lost or gained\n\nThe longer the sentence, the less it's able to imply\nwriting by implication should be one of your goals.\n\nOne of a writer's most important tools, the ability to:\n\n- suggest more than the words seem to allow\n- speak to the reader in silence\n\n### how to read to write?\n\nyou are two people, writer and reader\n\nYou can only become a better writer by becoming a better reader\n\nyou've read millions of words arranged by other writers\n\nDon't read just to extract or deposit meaning\n\nBe happy in the presence of every sentences as it passes by\n\nA sentence has many qualities: it has rhythm, velocity, it uses metaphor and simile, it stirs and gratifies the reader's expectations, it identifies the reader, it names the world, etc.\n\nYou're the curator of all these qualities in the sentences you make.\n\n### how to interrogate sentences?\n\nEvery work of literature is the result of thousands and\nthousands of decisions. It's the living tissue of a writer's choice.\n\nImagine the reason behind each sentence.\n\n- Why is it shaped this way and not some other way?\n- Why that choice of words?\n- Why that phrasing?\n- Why that rhythm?\n\n### how to practice noticing?\n\n- noticing means thinking with all your senses\n- it's also an exercise in not writing.\n- it requires a suspension in yearning\n- pause in the desire to be pouring something out of yourself\n- let yourself out into the world, rather than siphoning the world into you in order to transmute it into words\n\n### why notice?\n\nIf you notice something, it’s because it’s important.\n\nBut what you notice depends on what you allow yourself to\nnotice\n\nThe authority you feel has a great deal to do with how you\nwrite, and what you write, With your ability to pay attention to the shape and meaning of your own thoughts.\n\nAnd the value of your own perceptions.\n\nBeing a writer is an act of perpetual self-authorization.\n\nNo matter who you are.\n\nOnly you can authorize yourself.\n\nYou do that by writing well, by constant discovery.\n\n### What is the problems most writers face?\n\nThe problem most writers face isn’t writing.\n\nIt’s consciousness.\n\nAttention.\n\nNoticing.\n\nThat includes noticing language.\n\nThe fundamental act of revision is literally becoming\nconscious of the sentence,\n\nSeeing it for what it is, word for word, as a shape, and in\nrelation to all the other sentences in the piece.\n\n### how to read aloud?\n\nTry reading the words on the page as though they were\nmeant to be spoken plainly\n\nTo a listener who is both you and not you—\n\nAn imaginary listener seated not too far away.\n\nThat way your attention isn’t only on the words you’re\nreading.\n\nIt’s on the transmission of those words.\n\nAs you read aloud, catch the rhythm of the sentences without\noveremphasizing it.\n\nRead so the listener can hear the shape of the syntax.\n\nHow well you read aloud reveals how well you understand\nthe syntax of a sentence\n\nRemember how well some students read and others, how\nbadly?\n\nIt was a difference in comprehension,\n\nNot of the sentence’s meaning,\n\nBut of its texture, pace, structure, actuality\n\n### what questions to ask to revise?\n\n- How many sentences begin with the subject?\n- How many begin with an opening phrase before the subject?\n- How many begin with “There” or “It”?\n- What kinds of nouns do you see?\n- Abstractions? Generalizations?\n- Is the subject of the sentence an actor capable of performing\n  the action of the verb?\n- How close is the subject to its verb?\n- How many of the verbs are variants of “to be”—“is,” “are,”\n  “were,” “was,” and so on?\n- Are the verbs active, energetic?\n- Are the constructions passive?\n- How often does the word “as” appear, and in which of its\n  many senses?\n- Are you using “with” as a preposition or as a false\n  conjunction, a false relative pronoun?\n- Are there inadvertent repetitions—words repeated\n  unintentionally?\n- Is every phrase in its proper place, every word?\n- Is everything next to what it should be next to?\n- Anything outright ungrammatical?\n- Words used improperly?\n- Do verbs that require direct objects (transitive verbs) lack\n  them?\n- If there’s a modifying phrase at the start of the sentence, does\n  it modify the subject of the sentence? (It must.)\n- Can the sentence be broken in two or three?\n\n### what to know for grammar and syntax?\n\n- the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs.\n- The difference between active and passive constructions.\n- The relation between a pronoun and its antecedent.\n- All the parts of speech.\n- The different verb tenses.\n- The nature of participles and their role as modiGers.\n- The subtleties of prepositions—the hardest part of speech\n  even for native speakers of English.\n- You need a toolbox of rhetorical devices, like irony,\n  hyperbole,\n- And the various kinds of analogy.\n- You need an ever-growing vocabulary — and with it the\n  awareness that most words carry several meanings\n\n### what to circle?\n\n- Circle the direct objects.\n- The indirect objects.\n- The participles.\n- The relative pronouns.\n- The metaphors and similes and analogies.\n- Any word that seems to be used in a way that distorts its\n  meaning.\n- Any particularly rhythmic phrases or sentences.\n- Any spot where you sense a change in direction or time or\n  voice.\n- Any phrase that interests you.\n- Any word that stops you.\n- Anything you notice, whether you think it matters or not. It matters because you noticed it.\n\n### why learn grammar and syntax?\n\n(1) it's keeping the rules from obtruding themselves upon the\nreader because you've Ignored them\n\nIf a sentence offers an ambiguous path—two ways of being\nread—this reader will always take the wrong one.\n\n(2) it's the precondition for being sure.\n\nYour sentences say what you think they say.\n\n### why there's no writer's block?\n\nWriting is not natural.\n\nThere's no flow. There's only:\n\n- loss of confidence\n- And forgetting to think\n- And failing to prepare\n- And not reading enough\n- And giving up on patience\n- And hastening to write\n- And fearing your audience\n- And never really trying to understand how sentences work\n- Above all, there’s never learning to trust yourself\n- Or your capacity to learn or think or perceive\n\n### what are characteristics of good prose?\n\n- They’re fairly short.\n- They’re rhythmic, often with the rhythms of actual speech.\n- The diction is simple—very few multisyllabic words.\n- The construction — almost no suspended phrases or\n  dependent clauses.\n- An acute awareness of the listener’s attention\n  and understanding\n- A sense of contextual alertness, and a vivid sense of the\n  unspoken.\n\n### what is style?\n\nIt’s the fusion of your command of language and your\ncommitment to your own intent\n\nYou don’t need to think about style.\n\nPursue clarity instead.\n\nIn the pursuit of clarity, style reveals itself.\n\n### Are my ideas good enough?\n\nThe first person who needs to be persuaded of your authority\nis you.\n\nYou're afraid your ideas aren't good enough,\n\nBut what if your ideas are coherent and thoughtful?\n\nWhat if your perceptions are accurate and true?\n\nYour sentences clear and direct?\n\nWhat if allowing us to see what’s accurate and true is among\nthe best work writing can do?\n\nThe only sure test of your ideas is whether they interest you\n\nAnd arouse your own expectations\n\n### how to revise?\n\n- Work from the small-scale, start by fixing the sentences that need fixing\n- Explore the possibilities that open up.\n- Continue making small, incremental changes at the sentence level wherever you see problems, with no priority given to the beginning or end of the piece.\n- Listen for rhythm\n- Anything that strikes you — anything that causes a subtle, inward sensation of discomfort, an inner alarm, no matter how faint—stop there and figure out what’s going on.\n- there's often a better sentence hiding under a good sentence. don't just shift around with the same words, reimagine it, put effort into fixing it.\n- Curiosity, patience, and the ability to improvise are good tools for revising\n- So is the ability to remain open to the work and let it remain open to you.\n\n### how to know if a sentence is good?\n\n- you sense an inward difference, a subtle feeling telling you this sentence isn't the same as the others\n- learning this feeling is important. It's a guide and an incentive to making more good sentences.\n- it happens against the backdrop of your constant reading and unending exposure to superb sentences.\n\n### what is the foundation of writing?\n\nThere's nothing linear in your growth as a writer.\n\nThe moment you find yourself getting good at one thing, it's time to push on to unsafe terrain.\n\nTo do this work requires a balance between:\n\n(1) your commitment to the sentences you're making  \n(2) and the knowledge that each of them could be otherwise.\n\nmake that simple distinction again and again and you'll get good at making this distinction.\n\nThis is the foundation of writing.\n\nLiving somewhere between certainty and flux.\n\nLearning to remember that your sentences don't acquire their final inertia until you release them.\n\nThat your sentences, written down, are in the condition of waiting to be examined.\n\n### when to stop revising?\n\nrevise toward brevity – remove words instead of adding them.\n\n- Toward directness—language that isn’t evasive or\n  periphrastic.\n- Toward simplicity—in construction and word choice.\n- Toward clarity—a constant lookout for ambiguity.\n- Toward rhythm—where it’s lacking.\n- Toward literalness—as an antidote to obscurity.\n- Toward implication—the silent utterance of your sentences.\n- Toward variation—always.\n- Toward silence—leave some.\n- Toward the name of the world—yours to discover.\n- Toward presence—the quiet authority of your prose\n\n### what questions to ask while reading?\n\n- Whether you like a passage or not.\n- Whether you like the author or not.\n- Whether or not you think the author likes you.\n- Whether you like what a passage is saying.\n\n### how to keep going?\n\nNever stop reading  \nSay more than you thought you knew how to say  \nIn sentences better than you ever imagined  \nFor the reader who reads between the lines.\n",

Pull-based system\n   > work on 2-3 things at a time and only take on new tasks once they're completed\n   - keep track of your TODOs in a list\n   - actively work on the top part of this list (2-3 things), everything else is the bottom part\n   - any new work or ideas goes to the bottom\n   - only when you finish something, pull something new from the list below.\n2. Multiscale planning\n   > big picture planning that keeps you focused on what matters so you're not wandering through your day, dispersing energy on small, unimportant tasks.\n   - plan on 3 scales: daily, weekly, seasonally\n   - **seasonal -> weekly**\n     - the seasonal plans help you decide the big objectives you want to hit; serving as reminders to yourself about what matters.\n     - it helps you plan your week; adjusting the blocks in your calendar to make progress on your goals\n   - **weekly -> daily**\n     - the weekly plans help you decide what to work on each day\n     - use time blocking to plan your days down to the hour so you're not figuring out what to do next.\n3. Shutdown Ritual\n   > have a ritual that clearly separate the end of work and after work. A way to disengage from work and give your mind a break to focus on family and other work.\n   - **review and write**: look at your inbox, make sure there's nothing urgent that still needs to be dealt with, write down everything in your head that's important, ideas and potential solutions you're thinking about\n   - **plan the next day**: move over your unfinished tasks, decide the next action steps, schedule with time blocks.\n   - **end the routine**: Cal uses a phrase \"schedule, shutdown, complete\" that indicates the routine is done.\n",

But the more he studied, the more often he would find himself asking his most famous question.\n\n\"Que sais je?\" or \"What do I know?\"\n\nThe answer, \"Nothing\".\n\nMontaigne [constantly questioned](https://tim.blog/2010/10/19/michel-de-montaigne/) what he \"knew\" and deliberately doubted all his assumptions.\n\nInstead of holding on to your beliefs stubbornly and criticizing others for changing their minds, Montaigne would say that changing your mind is a good thing.\n\nIt means you've \"resisted the impulse to think you're infallible\", i.e. you think you already know it all and that you're right and everyone is wrong.\n\nIn his vocation of gaining and intimate knowledge of himself through self-experimentation and observations, he finds \"“boundless depths and variety that [his] apprenticeship bears no other fruit than to make me know much there remains to learn.\"\n\nThis should be our attitude when we learn something new, acknowledge that all it teaches us is how much more we need to learn.\n",

    "content": "\n![my curius links](/images/curius.png)\n\nI've been using [curius](https://curius.app/benedict-neo) since March 2023, my first link saved was Nat Friedman's [personal website](https://nat.org/).\n\nIt's been a year now, and I've saved a total of 1723 articles as of today.\n\nI came across this [tweet](https://x.com/gd3kr/status/1758198206599455224?s=20) by [aarya](https://twitter.com/gd3kr) where he embedded his twitter bookmarks and visualized it on the [Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/).\n\nThis inspired me to embed my curius links. Since I can the data easily with the API, and he provided the [code](https://gist.github.com/gd3kr/c4c0687a5f7e91b1a84bcacea6500011) to compute the embeddings. I thought it would be a fun half-day hack.\n\nUsing ChatGPT and Cursor, building this out was a lot of fun. It's one of those projects where I personally would use it and can see others using it as well. So I was building out of necessity.\n\nI've been procrastinating on a lot of ideas and writings because they never felt necessary. So I love it when I have moments where inspiration strikes, and that spark aligns well with my needs.\n\nOnce I was done I pushed the [code](https://github.com/benthecoder/embedcurius), deployed the [streamlit app](https://curius.streamlit.app) so others can get their embeddings as well.\n\nAt exactly 5:55 pm, I made [a tweet](https://twitter.com/benxneo/status/1769663962143158718) on it.\n\nIt's cool to see these links visualized on the vector space. The separation isn't perfect, some points (links) don't belong close to each other, but I can see my diving into rabbit holes sessions on the internet forming dozens of clusters, representing the intense curiosity I have of the world, of people, and of myself.\n\nIt's like thousands of hours of reading about friendships, climate startups, tutorials and blogs about AI, photography videos, artworks I saved for later, all in one 3-dimensional graph. A snapshot of my digital travels the past year.\n\nI had an idea of comparing my embeddings of all my articles with other curius readers, and that can be a fun extension to this project.\n\nBut for now, it works.\n\n---\n\nThe past few weeks I've been on a slump, maybe it's the surgery, or because I'm trying to fit too many things into one day. I felt like I wasn't doing anything most days. So focusing on just this idea today made it productive and fulfilling.\n\nThis was also the day I got to 1,000 followers on Twitter. Most of my following came from my medium days when I was posting my articles. The only post I'm proud of from 2023 was this [tweet](https://x.com/benxneo/status/1631893511220916225?s=20) I made sharing the ClassGPT app. That got me a few more followers. Lately, since I published [roadmap to learn AI](https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/a-roadmap-to-learn-ai-in-2024-cc30c6aa6e16) a lot of people have been following me, and I was consistently watching my follower count, hoping for it to reach 1k soon. Now that I reached it I realized how pointless and toxic it was to do that. Most of my followers are probably bots, and I'm not putting enough effort into creating my own original content. So I probably only have <200 actual followers.\n\nMy goal now is to just work on what I love and share it. And focus more on doing the work; work that feels like play. My taste-skill gap is enormous right now. It's time to put in the work to get the skills by doing.\n\nTwitter is a high-value and high-signal platform where you can create your own luck. And I have to start increasing my surface area of luck if I want to be in the US.\n",

So if you work with fashion or design or filmmaking, or even banking, you know, **it’s basically the same principles that have a different shape**, but if you’ve moved from one to another, then you start to see the pattern. Everything I do is some kind of experiment and I’ve been surprised many times that **if you have the will to try things, chances are that it works**.\n\n### on Swedish architecture\n\n> I’m actually impressed when some Swedish friends can do great work because they have been fed with this bad kind of boring grey socialistic approach where everything looks the same. Just look at the colours. Everything is brown or beige.\n\n### on loving your work\n\n> If you’re not happy working with a specific subject, experiment, do something else [...] I’m always pushing people to find a way to be happier going to work\n>\n> I’ve always questioned why people have hobbies, **why can’t life just be one entity**, why do you have to separate family from work? It’s very common that you go to work doing something you don’t like, that’s why you need to have hobbies as a substitute to make you happy.\n\n### on going slow\n\n> there is a certain cultural fascination with fast growth, IPOs and so on, but I want to go slow, really slow and think long-term. It takes time to do good things.\n>\n> You see, this cultural phenomenon of speed and growth at all costs is displayed in every startup, they all look the same, it’s like fast food: it looks good, its taste it’s consistent but then you feel horrible afterwards.\n\n### on design\n\n> <mark>I believe design is just good engineering. That’s why I tell my designers to always think like an engineer. So I set up really strict rules on how they are allowed to work</mark> . So for example, we’re only allowed to use six or eight colours in total, same with the typeface, we only write in lowercase with one font in a set of sizes that is in a system connected to a grid.\n\n### on creative work\n\n> With any kind of creative work you start disabling as much as possible and narrow it down only to the necessary tools you need, and from there start making the work. That’s what I believe makes you super creative.\n\n### on German and Italian design\n\n> Everything design-wise that I love is German or Italian, for me it’s the perfect combination. With the passion from Italy and the set of rules from Germany, that balance is perfect.\n\n### on culture and inspiration\n\n> I sum it up with a way of thinking that comes from culture and that’s something you can’t learn. I love to reference other cultures and I always tell my designers that <mark>you can’t control your output, you can only control the input</mark>.\n>\n> That’s why it’s so important to <mark>gather inspiration, read interesting books and explore subjects outside your profession, that’s what makes you able to create interesting things in your profession</mark>. Another reason why I feed myself with engineering stuff, like manuals, learning how things work and so on.\n\n### on Honda and Sony in the 70s/80s\n\n> ”Sony is the company where engineers’ dreams come true”. What both companies have done is split the offices in two sections, one with engineers working on products, the other with sales and finances, so that the two couldn’t interact.\n>\n> By doing so, there wouldn’t be decisions coming from marketing on what kind of products to push to market, the decisions came directly from the r&d departments.\n\n### on democracy\n\n> The democratic side is super interesting for me. You can build that in the design, **you can design to remove expectations and change the behaviour of the people who use your products**.\n>\n> I believe you can design a product like a point-and-shoot camera that opens up the industry to a whole group of people who is not necessarily familiar with the language and doesn’t know about framing but still give access to it so you can design in a way that makes products accessible to people.\n\n### on starting companies\n\n> I never set out to start companies, I see it more like putting together a band and that’s the thing we create and hopefully, we’ll be recognised for that thing that stands for good quality. It’s a metaphor that I find very close to me.\n\n### on creating products\n\n> What’s so beautiful about creating products is that saying it in a poetic way, <mark>if you have that passion it naturally starts waves and those waves connect people</mark>. Then you don’t know where it’s going to end up, anything can happen, but if you don’t do anything, if you don’t write that text, if you don’t draw that picture or design that object, you can’t expect anything to happen. You need to start that chain reaction in life.\n\n### on what comes next\n\n> Technology coming closer and closer to your body, removing that layer of disconnection that a phone or watch still possesses. Not just from a design perspective but also from the user interface one, **technology will gradually disappear and the next operating system will be a combination of your eyesight and sound**. When the pendulum moves back, the next step will be physical aberration where you want to touch everything again and that’s a bit of what I’m working on\n",

I notice everything around me with greater detail and depth. This makes my environment more interesting, conjuring childlike wonder that makes me look at people, objects, architecture, and moments that make me go “I should capture this”.\n\nWhat triggers that inner feeling that drives me to capture something is when there’s a story to tell.\n\nA good picture is worth many words. The stories tell themselves in the lives of those who look at them. Like art, you project your own feelings and thoughts onto what you see.\n\nMy hope is that they remind people of their memories, good and bad, their future goals and aspirations, their sadness and joy, their wonder for existence, and of the beauty in the ordinary and mundane of our daily lives.\n\nThis makes taking pictures akin to writing, in the sense that you have to take the time to compose to tell a good story. Often times you get it wrong, so you revise. You look from a different angle, you find a better framing, you stand at a new spot to capture your subject. Sometimes the timing is right, and you make the impulsive and unplanned shots that manages to bring down the bird of thought as it flashes by. You capture all of them ruthlessly, leaving nothing behind.\n\nI'm a goal oriented person, so photography feels like a game where the goal is to squeeze every possible shot I can out of a place. The downside of this is I'm completely occupied with photography like it's my vocation and barely have time to actually see and observe things for myself. For example, I was at an alleyway taking pictures, and the entire time and I never stopped to browse anything that was sold. So I have to find the right balance of shooting and \"being\"?\n\nOn a final note, with a camera, I feel gifted with the authority to capture things. It’s like I’ve been sanctioned to be walking around, taking pictures of people and things. You can’t do that with a phone camera, it feels unwarranted.\n\nPictures with a smartphone are cheap, it’s quick and trivial, it’s automatic, and it feels unlimited.\n\nPictures with a camera are meaningful, they’re slower and requires thought and skill, and it’s feels limited (sometimes they are).\n\nI captured a lot of moments in my trip to Penang, they're organized by location – a restaurant or a street. I posted 100 photos from a 2 day trip on my [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/bengotafujifilm/).\n\nI'm excited for my upcoming trips. Let's see what stories I can tell in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.\n",

That's the main question. And <mark>to know if you're an artist or not is like breathing. You don't question breathing. You have to breathe</mark>. Otherwise you just die. So you breathe.\n>\n> So if you wake up in the morning and you have some ideas and you have to make them, and this becomes like a kind obsession, and <mark>you have to create, and you have this urge to create, you're definitely an artist</mark>, but you're not a great artist. You're just an artist.\n>\n> To be a great artist, that's all different types of rules. And it's like you're obsessed. It's like it's nothing else in your mind.\n\nready to fail\n\n> I think the great artists have to be ready to fail, which not too many people are, because when you have success in a certain way, and the public accept you in a certain way, you start somehow involuntary, reproducing the same images, the same type of work, and you're not risking.\n>\n> And the real artists always change their territories and they go to the land they've never been; when there is unknown territory, then you can fail and you can risk.\n\nescape routine\n\n> If you are drawing with your right hand and you're getting better and better, and with closed eyes, you can draw anything you want, immediately change to the left hand. When you become routine, that is end of everything\n\n1-2 good ideas\n\n> <mark>In your lifetime, you probably will have one good idea. If you're a really good artist and if you're a genius, two good ideas, and that's it</mark>. But be careful with them.\n\n### [William Kentridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kentridge?useskin=vector)\n\n> So I think it has to do with the specific interaction of the person giving the advice and the person receiving it.\n>\n> Work hard, do your best, do what you like, and people will respect you for it. It doesn't matter what subject you take on. In the end, whatever you do is going to be a self portrait. It will reveal who you are. If it's arrogant, it's about you. If it's pretentious, that's about you. Don't think you can escape yourself by your choice of subject matter.\n>\n> There are many things like that that one can say, but unless someone is needing those words, they don't get heard.\n\n### [Patti Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith?useskin=vector)\n\nbuild a good name\n\n> When I was really young, William Burrows told me, and I was really struggling. We never had any money. The advice that William gave me was build a good name. Keep your name clean, don't make compromises.\n>\n> Don't worry about making a bunch of money or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work and make the right choices and protect your work. And if you build a good name, eventually that name will be its own currency.\n\nlife is suffering\n\n> To be an artist, actually to be a human being. In these times, it's all difficult.\n>\n> Sometimes you'll be sick, sometimes you'll have a really bad toothache, sometimes you'll be hungry. But on the other end, you'll have the most beautiful experiences. Sometimes just the sky, sometimes a piece of work that you do that feels so wonderful, or you find somebody to love, or your children, or there's beautiful things in life. So when you're suffering, just. It's part of the package.\n>\n> You look at it, we're born and we also have to die. We know that. So it make sense that we're going to be really happy and things are going to be really bad too.\n\n### [Dinos and Jake Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_and_Dinos_Chapman?useskin=vector)\n\n> We're so immersed in the bullsh\\*t of our own activities to know even how to give anyone advice\n>\n> Wrap up warm. Eat properly, sensibly, don't smoke. And <mark>phone your mum</mark>.\n\n### [David Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne?useskin=vector)\n\n> The only advice I have is probably things that a lot of young musicians and artists already know. That although some of them may have the ambition to be the next Jay Z or the next whatever it is, the number of those artists are very, very small.\n>\n> And often the artists who are very successful that way, they don't have much flexibility. <mark>In achieving success, they lose a lot of their creative freedom</mark>. They have to keep making the same thing more or less over and over and over again. And that if the musician or artist values their freedom and the ability to be creative, then they have to maybe realize that they won't be making hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n### [Wim Wenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Wenders?useskin=vector)\n\n> Don't do anything that somebody else, that you know deep in your heart, somebody else can do better, but <mark>do what nobody else can do except for you</mark>.\n\n### [Olafur Eliasson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olafur_Eliasson?useskin=vector)\n\nbe sensitive\n\n> My advice to younger artists would be something like to be very sensitive to where they are in what times, in what part of the world, and how that constitutes the artistic practice, the artistic inquiry.\n\nmaking art is making the world\n\n> I think working with art is working with something that is very fierce, very strong, very robust, and even though the whole world seems to say that art is fragile, should be marginalized. It's not important. It's counterproductive. It doesn't belong to the center of what reality is defined as.\n>\n> Artists should have confidence in the fact that, well, making a drawing on a piece of paper is changing the world. By definition, <mark>making art is making the world</mark>.\n>\n> So it is an unbelievably rewarding thing to be an artist and to be full behind that idea as a young artist. And to actually see that having chosen, in many perspectives, the strange choice to become an artist is also to have chosen to be a part of the world.\n",

Stray Dog, Misawa. 1971](/images/dog.jpg)\n\nI've been obsessed with photography lately, my YouTube feed is sprinkled with shooting tips for beginners and interviews with famous photographers.\n\nOne photographer I discovered recently is Daido Moriyama, a japanese photographer best known for his black-and-white street photography. His most well-known photo is the [stray dog](https://cdn.flipsnack.com/widget/v2/flipsnackwidget.html?hash=ft90b8a51&bgcolor=EEEEEE&t=1506628342).\n\nIn the video [Japanese Style Photography, the art of Moriyama Daido](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4qjkycmyyk), his photos are described as trips through faded memories and is infused with the [wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi?useskin=vector) philosophy.\n\nWestern-style photographers like [Ansel Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams) and [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson?useskin=vector); they look for perfection, composition, style. For Daido, he accept the images as they come into his camera.\n\nHis shooting [technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daid%C5%8D_Moriyama?useskin=vector#Technique) according to Wiki:\n\n> Moriyama tends to capture images without looking through the viewfinder, so as to separate himself from the detached, scientific, and deliberate cropping produced by the viewfinder lens. He often takes a large volume of photographs of the world as it passes by him, embracing the uncertainty and indeterminacy of encountering the scenes as they reveal themselves during the development process\n\nI also watched [Artist Daido Moriyama – In Pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foWAs3V_lkg&list=WL) by Tate.\n\nBelow are some of my favorite quotes from the video.\n\non childhood\n\n> I moved a lot as a child. I'm creating my own home by connecting pieces of images from my imagination and things I saw as a child. That's how I feel about my work.\n\non shooting\n\n> Cities are enormous bodies of people's desire, and as I search for my own desires within them, I slice into time, seeing the moment. That's the kind of camera work I like.\n\n> I walk very fast. I like taking snapshots in the movement of both myself and the outside world. When I walk around I probably look like a street dog because after walking around the main roads, I keep wandering around the back streets.\n\non black-and-white\n\n> monochrome has stronger elements of abstraction and symbolism. There is perhaps and element of taking you to another place. Black and white has that physical effect on me, thats just the way I respond to things. Color is something more vulgar, because color is making the decisions\n\non photography\n\n> the most important thing that a photographer can do is relate both the photographer and the viewer's memories\n\n> at first sight a photograph looks straightforward as it slices off a scene or a moment in time. But the images that photography captures are actually ambiguous. And it's because of this ambiguity that I like photography.\n\non age and desire\n\n> I often hear it said that people, even photographers, do their best work when they are in their 20s and 30s, I'm 73 now, but I could never see the city with an old man's eyes or as if I understood everything. Everyone has desires. The quality and volume of those desires changes with age, but that desire is alway serious and real. Photography is an expression of those desires. So that way of thinking or speaking is nonsense to me. Completely meaningless.\n\nIn an [interview](https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/daido-moriyama-essence-photography/?transcript=expand) with SF MOMA, he talks about the essence of photography.\n\nTo him, photography is about copying.\n\n> What is photography? How do I see the outside world? I think the essence of photography is the concept of copying or duplication. Andy Warhol copied photographs of various scenes and produced his works from them. And then he made copies of those works. I think he held that concept within him. And that concept is really close to what I think the essence of photography is.\n>\n> In other words, I don’t see the act of taking photographs as an artistic act of creating \"art pieces.\" I’ve always thought of it as making copies. So I totally related to what Warhol was doing. Photographing the city, cars, people, TV screens, posters, film screens... I consider them all the same. So I wasn’t really interested in shooting the TV screen; it was just one subject in my point of view\n>\n> Photography is taking pictures of common manners and customs. When I shoot, I’m driven by my interests, my physical reactions, my memories, and all kinds of other elements. It’s the people who observe my work that give it any kind of meaning. I just continue to offer them what I’ve captured with my mind and body.\n>\n> I want to look at everything and capture everything. Of course, in reality, that’s impossible, but that’s my intention. And I don’t walk around with a certain concept, choosing what to shoot and what not to. I don’t think.\n",

    "content": "\nThere a survey that says [Danish](https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/happiness) are the happiest people.\n\nA Danish once said the secret to happiness is low expectations.\n\nI've always wondered how you can combine ideally low expectations, so you're not constantly disappointed, while having ambition: striving and doing great things. These two concepts feel like polar opposites that cannot cohabitate.\n\nAlain de Botton tells us that having low expectations in some areas doesn't mean you lose ambition. You can have ambition and realism, you can be sober in some areas yet still be deeply excited to get out of bed in the morning. You can have these paradoxical positions on issues.\n\nHe explores the idea of a cheerful pessimist in a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KreaV59NkE) with Tim Ferris.\n\n> if you're a little pessimistic about how a lot of things go, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be gloomy all the time. You may encounter moments of pure ecstasy as you realize that there are some very fine things in a world which is otherwise very dark.\n>\n> I don't think. A backdrop of stark realism/pessimism about all sorts of things. That death and illness can visit us very suddenly without warning. That all our grandest plans can be undone by a blood clot in under a minute. That some of the finest ambitions fall prey to the meanest realities, et cetera. That many of us, perhaps all of us, are going to go to our deathbeds with some very important parts of us still unexplored.\n>\n> I think it's because things are so dark, because we are operating against a backdrop of darkness. That a glass of beautiful lemon juice or a sincere conversation with a friend or a moment when, yes, things do go right and everything does go right. Why these things matter so much and perhaps much more intensely. It's like the joy of the convalescent who's come out of the hospital and they are seeing the sunlight strike the leaves of a daffodil.\n>\n> And that daffodil seems more beautiful than it's ever done to the robust football player who hasn't ever paused to appreciate these things. So, as I say, I think it should be utterly compatible with ambition, appreciation, tenderness, et cetera. To keep the really grim things not far from the top of consciousness kind of pretty much every day.\n\nWhat I took away from this is in all the things we do, we can strive for greatness, but we have to be prepared for the worst outcome. An essential [tenet of the Stoics](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/why-stoicism-continues-to-matter/) is to expect the worst possible outcome, and then remind ourselves that the worst is survivable.\n\nThis encourages to appreciate the little joys of life more deeply. By realizing that life is merciless and we are faced with illness, calamities, or mortality at any given moment, we focus on doing what we love, with the people we love.\n",

Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”\n>\n> – Richard Feynman\n\nRichard Hamming had the [same idea](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) too.\n\n> Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say \"Well that bears on this problem.\" They drop all the other things and get after it.\n>\n> Now I can tell you a horror story that was told to me but I can't vouch for the truth of it. I was sitting in an airport talking to a friend of mine from Los Alamos about how it was lucky that the fission experiment occurred over in Europe when it did because that got us working on the atomic bomb here in the US. He said \"No; at Berkeley we had gathered a bunch of data; we didn't get around to reducing it because we were building some more equipment, but if we had reduced that data we would have found fission.\" They had it in their hands and they didn't pursue it. They came in second!\n>\n> The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things. They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it. Now of course lots of times it doesn't work out, but you don't have to hit many of them to do some great science. It's kind of easy. One of the chief tricks is to live a long time!\n>\n> – Richard Hamming, \"You and Your Research\"\n\nHere are my 12 favorite problems\n\n1. how to imbue curiosity and agency in others?\n2. how to write with authority and authenticity?\n3. how to figure out which big problems to devote your life to?

Love only makes sense in the context of impending oblivion.\"\n  - don't get into friendships / romantic relationships to fill the void, believing they'll fix everything\n  - French analyst Jacques Lacan: \"Desire has indestructible permanence. Desire is inextinguishable\"\n- self-differentiate\n  - In _A Passionate Marriage_ David Schnarch, it's defined as <mark>the ability to \"maintain who you are while you’re _close_ to the people important to you\"</mark>\n  - for with insecure attachment: they long for emotional fusion or avoidance to defend against engulfment.\n  - <mark>\"if you're sufficiently differentiated, you don't need to fuse to feel safe, and you don't need to hide to maintain your own individuality\"</mark>\n  - you succeed in a relationship by giving, but you have to know how to give without hurting yourself.\n  - a test: \"can you maintain boundaries when you're around people you love? Do you behave in a way you feel happy with, or do you betray yourself?\n- do not try to change people\n  - don't hope for people to change to keep the fantasy of a happy future alive\n  - people change only when they're ready, not because we hope they will\n- say the thing\n  - you can't fake it or pretend it, it'll show through and all it does is stop you from connecting to someone in a real way\n  - consistently saying what you want to say is a strength not a vulnerability\n  - be self-aware enough to disclose the ugly things about yourself (charismatic people often weaponize their vulnerability)\n",

I'm hurrrt!\"\n  - say \"I'll be up for talking another time about this if you want\", don't say \"when you are less angry\"\n- do not give advice\n  - the person already knows the answer or the best solution – or at least, has a preference\n  - all you have to do is repeat what they're saying back to them\n  - don't talk about your experience unless the person is specifically asking for it (see below)\n- do not relate\n  - empathy is not \"hey that happened to me too!\" or \"I also know what you're talking about – in fact I know more about it than you do!\" (this is one-upping)\n  - turn away from your ego and say \"that must've hurt a lot!\" and look at the person in the eyes\n- ask questions\n  - ask good straightforward questions you think the person might like to answer, even if it's unrelated to the issue (a therapist trick to get people going)\n  - ask \"what happened?\" \"What kind of place was that?\" When did you first...?\" and other non yes-or-no questions\n  - don't ask a lot of \"why\" questions (this can lead to defensiveness and quick justifications for behaviour)\n",

    "content": "\nA video on [Fuji X100VI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNb4hPvLWYQ) popped up on my YT feed one day and that started a week-long rabbit hole down digital film cameras.\n\nI started getting a ton of videos on digital film cameras on my homepage.\n\nEventually, starting with Fuji, then discovering Ricoh, Olympus, Leica, and Panasonic, I eventually landed back on the x100s, which is the 2nd gen of the X100 series.\n\nToday, I met up with a seller to buy a third-hand x100s at KLCC.\n\nI was at the food court going through every detail about the camera, making sure this is a good purchase. This is my first camera, ever, so I asked a lot of basic questions about photography as well. I paid RM1999 for it, which I believe is a good deal. Even though the silver paint has come off at the edges, and it looks old, but I like that it has history; It's been in the hands of two photographers who enjoyed the craft.\n\nWhen I walked home from the train station with my mom I took a lot of shots.\n\nI made an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bengotafujifilm/) page for the special ones, with more to come.\n\nI added a couple [X-Trans II recipes](https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-ii-recipes/) to fully utilize what fujifilm has to offer.\n\n- C1: [Provia/STD](https://fujixweekly.com/2020/08/02/fujifilm-xq1-x-trans-ii-film-simulation-recipe-kodachrome-without-classic-chrome/)\n- C2: [PRO Neg. Std](https://fujixweekly.com/2022/01/24/fujifilm-x-t1-x-trans-ii-film-simulation-recipe-scanned-negative/)\n- C3: [PRO Neg. Hi](https://fujixweekly.com/2023/08/08/pro-film-fujifilm-x70-x-trans-ii-film-simulation-recipe/)\n\nI tried setting a recipe for Basic but it just gets overwritten each time so I think it can only hold 3.\n\nI'm still confused about [what an ND filter does](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4142610).\n\nAnd just learned what shutter speed, ISO and aperture does. I found a good [eli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/aq1y0a/eli5_photography_shutter_speed_iso_and_aperture/).\n\nFor some notes\n\n- these three are knobs that control how much brightness you get\n- shutter speed\n  - shorter = little light\n  - longer = lots of light (produces the blur effect in photos)\n- sensitivity (ISO)\n  - lower = less sensitive (bright)\n  - higher = more sensitive (more grainy and noisy)\n- aperture (f-stop)\n  - lower (f/1.8) = wider opening, more brightness (shallow depth of field, portrait mode)\n  - higher (f/16) = narrow opening, less brightness (entire image in focus)\n\nYou want an image where the brightest points are not almost-but-not-quite 100% white, and the darkest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% black.\n\nA nice analogy for aperture\n\n> Make a pin hole with one hand, hold it up to your eye (like a teeny tiny telescope) and then stretch your other arm and hold up a finger. Notice the finger and background will both be in focus. Remove your pinhole hand and then you can manually focus on either the finger or background.\n\nOne practical tip is to use the exposure-meter which tells you how exposed the photo is going to be.\n\nI'm excited to see what moments I can capture from this camera.\n\nNext is to buy a camcorder and start vlogging.\n",

    "content": "\n![The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus, Joseph Wright of Derby, 1795](/images/phosphorus.jpeg)\n\nI read [Hunter S. Thompson's Letter](https://fs.blog/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/) on finding purpose and living a meaningful life.\n\nThe biggest takeaway was his idea of not letting our goals define us, and to not even look for goals at all.\n\nWe see other successful people with their \"perfect\" lives and we make that our goal. We put our faith in these tangible goals, striving to be doctors, lawyers, investment bankers, business owners.\n\nHe calls it a tragedy of life that we seek to understand the goal and not the man (ourselves).\n\nWe set these goals that demands us of certain things, but it is unwise.\n\nWe are always changing. In every reaction to every diverse experience, we learn something new about ourselves; they alter our perspective and we become a different person. Is it not foolish to mould our lives to fit the contours of these goals if we're constantly changing every day?\n\nThe answer is to not deal with (tangible) goals at all.\n\nWe do not strive to be bankers nor doctors, **we strive to be ourselves**.\n\nRather than making the individual conform to the goal, we make the goal conform to the individual.\n\nHe gives a formula:\n\n> a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES.\n\nIn doing so, he:\n\n- fulfills a need (creates identity)\n- avoids frustrating his potential (no ceiling on his growth)\n- avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (his goal conforms to his abilities and desires, rather than bending himself to meet the demands of what he seeks)\n\nRather than dedicating his life to a pre-defined goal, he has chose a way of life he _knows_ he will enjoy.\n\n<mark>The goal is secondary, it is the functioning toward the goal that is important.</mark>\n\nThis path must be your own.\n\n> a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life--- the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual\n\nHe warns us to not look for goals, but look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and see what you can do to make a living _within_ that way of life.\n\nAnd finally leaves us with a reminder that our lives can still change.\n\n> no one HAS to do something he doesn't want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that's what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You'll have lots of company\n",

Thinking about thinking. Sitting with my feelings. I've done everything I set out to do. Now it's time to live up to them.\n\nI decided to just read today. Nothing else. Oh and a lot of YouTube.\n\nI was reading [Several Short Sentences About Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13155290-several-short-sentences-about-writing) by Verlyn Klinkenborg.\n\nI like this quote\n\n> “Without extraneous words or phrases or clauses, there will be room for implication. The longer the sentence, the less it’s able to imply, And writing by implication should be one of your goals. Implication is almost nonexistent in the prose that surrounds you, The prose of law, science, business, journalism, and most academic fields. It was nonexistent in the way you were taught to write. That means you don’t know how to use one of a writer’s most important tools: <mark>The ability to suggest more than the words seem to allow, The ability to speak to the reader in silence. </mark>”\n\nI had walking tour videos playing on my monitor.\n\nI went to [Venice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kccv6YJZ0P4), [Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aZlTVnq2eQ) and hiked [Alta Via 2 in Dolomites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKcnvPDgifA).\n\nI also went to [Tübingen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVAVdk819TI), a picturesque town in the southwestern part of Germany. The entire town looked like bright, vibrant paint was spilled all over, everywhere.\n\nAnd this [japan cat island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjfuB8Xjhc4).\n\nI want to travel so bad.\n\nI stumbled on a couple cute videos like [how to wash a kitten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymxEmbALjIo) and this [Shiba Inu store clerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6CcUj2mDbI)\n\nI've been binging on photography videos, I found this really good series on [Visual Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTQtLjIqecdydlanOGh6iwoWOb9VxpDts). Going to dive deeper into this when I get my camera and start shooting.\n\nI also discovered [the funniest girl in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJF5XlNzDgY). I like her personality.\n\nI found a lot of calm, relaxing playlists\n\n- [낭만](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw4N_GoIA-k)\n- [Dreamy songs that take you back to simpler times | a relaxed playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJu15Qq3To&t=2085s)\n- [playlist for calm moments ~ sped up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjBVw3NWvYI&t=146s)\n- [last days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6yq-HfwnFc&t=189s)\n- [(playlist/jazz) a collection of jazz that is not loud and calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p22EqQBYRBM)\n- [rain, books and coffee (playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bI0AhSyU0&t=5s)\n- [Peace.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBgloVgJD7M&t=535s)\n\nAnd a nice [read with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfcnpktwuq0) video.\n\nI'm also obsessed with [camcorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1I0Z9uldlg) now.

Turner, 1812](/images/life_mountain.jpg)\n\nI was reading John Gardner's piece on [Personal Renewal](https://www.pbs.org/johngardner/sections/writings_speech_1.html), there's a lot of nuggets of wisdom in here.\n\nBut the part that I want to internalize the most is where he describes what life is.\n\nMy whole life I believed that there's this concrete goal that I have to put all my efforts into achieving, a checkpoint in my life where I can feel I have arrive, a scoring system that tells me I've accumulated enough points to reward me the title of success, signifying that I've made it.\n\nIt's like a mountain that we scramble to climb to reach what we thought was the goal.\n\nBut when we finally get to the top and look around, chances are we feel empty. You wonder if you climbed the wrong mountain.\n\nGardner describes what life really is.\n\n> But life isn't a mountain that has a summit, Nor is it -- as some suppose -- a riddle that has an answer. Nor a game that has a final score.\n>\n> <mark>Life is an endless unfolding</mark>, and if we wish it to be, <mark>an endless process of self-discovery</mark>, an endless and unpredictable dialogue between our own potentialities and the life situations in which we find ourselves. By potentialities I mean not just intellectual gifts but the full range of one's capacities for learning, sensing, wondering, understanding, loving and aspiring.\n\nAnd these potentialities don't stop at any certain age. They only stop when you run out of challenges in life, which can never happen.\n\n> The thing you have to understand is that the capacities you actually develop to the full come out as the result of an interplay between you and life's challenges --and the challenges keep changing. <mark>Life pulls things out of you.</mark>\n\nThe beauty of our complex and inexplicable minds is that there's a depth to us that can never be fully explored, and we're constantly discovering new things about ourselves. Don't put a ceiling on your own growth.\n\n> You know about some of the gifts that you have left undeveloped. Would you believe that you have gifts and possibilities you don't even know about? It's true. We are just beginning to recognize how even those who have had every advantage and opportunity **unconsciously put a ceiling on their own growth, underestimate their potentialities or hide from the risk that growth involves**.\n",

Beautiful yet [cursed dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcLlpdE8siU). – Hayao Miyazaki”\n\nI watched [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyidOYwyrLI) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL34JpZGH9o) [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYJe31vCL-A) [analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0spWvl3wg) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewv2iNIqfsY) [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpc7gt_i638) The Wind Rises today.\n\nI get inspired whenever I watch movies a fervent protagonist obsess over a dream, go through the challenges and difficulties of achieving that dream, and finally make it in the end. I'm filled with the childlike wonder and belief that anything is possible, and our dreams are as real as we make of them.\n\nBut soon after, another feeling comes, I realize that most of us, we'll never achieve our dreams. We might not even know what our dream is. Some of us don't even have one. We just go through life, day by day, never realizing our true potential. And it's not because the person isn't doing what they can do achieve it, it's because their background and circumstances has defined their lives, they don't have the luxury of choice, to even taste the anxiety of unbounded possibilities ahead of them. The molten lava that once erupted, flared, and flowed in them has hardened, the fire that once burned passionately, sniffed out by the realities of life.\n\nMiyazaki's cursed dream was to make beautiful films. Jiro's cursed dream was to build beautiful airplanes.\n\nRight now it feels like I don't have one, at least, it's not clear. I have a fuzzy idea of what it might look like; I see bits and pieces of it that don't really make up anything yet. I might just be mimetic desire. I see young founders getting into YC and building companies that solve interesting problems and new-grads working on the cutting-edge like self-driving, robotics, aerospace in big tech companies that shape the world. I tell myself I want that too. Maybe it's the prestige I'm after. The millions, even billion dollar valuation that comes from this pursuit.\n\nEnvy arises when I see them everywhere, because deep down I think I'm capable of that too. I wasn't born in the US, nor did I go to a top-ranking university, but I believe it all comes down to hard work, curiosity, and luck. It's going to be extremely hard, it's a dark tunnel with no end in sight, but what's life if we're not throwing ourselves onto problems that grip us, that ones that will make us stay up all night, disregarding our health and sanity, because it feels like we're at the precipice of something big. Would you not choose that life over a life that is monotonous and plain.\n\nMaybe it goes back to the fear of having an ordinary life. I associate ordinary with failure, of not realizing my full potential. I feel like I have to accomplish _big_ things in my life. I want to leave it better than when I found it. I don't want fame. I don't need my name everywhere. But I want to see my creations making the world a better place.\n\nThis dream is a cursed dream. It's a dream that I cannot achieve by staying and being content with the country I was born in. The US is the place where people to make their dreams a reality. My cursed dream would mean that I won't be here as my parents grow older and weaker. But hopefully by then I'll be rich by then to have the luxury to visit them often, and even bring them over.\n\nI think it's hard to define my dream because it's another way of asking the big question of what I want out of my life. And these past few months where I was forced to slow down and sit with my thoughts. Reflecting on my life for the past two years: what I've been aiming at, what I've been running away from, what I've discovered about myself. I still have a lot of doubts about who I am. I'm malleable and porous. My identity is constantly being shaped and moulded by the things I consume and people around me.\n\nBut I know that as someone who grew up in a family operating on scarcity mindset, I'm really driven by money. I owe my dad a lot, I'm eternally grateful, but it's building up guilt. My health conditions + cosmetics stuff required almost ~RM30k so far. My excessively expensive undergrad education, and soon, grad school education that costs hundreds of thousands. His sacrifice has to be made worth by my success. Even if I don't have my own family, having enough money is so essential for a comfortable life. And how much is enough? Enough money means having the freedom to work on my own stuff in my own time, travelling, feeling unrushed, being able to spend more time with friends and family, reading lots of books and diving into rabbit holes without feeling guilty.\n\nAnyway, in an attempt to prompt my brain to define what my cursed dream is, here's what was generated.\n\nOn a small scale, my dream for myself is to make it in the US. And \"making it\" would mean building a life there in the next 5-10 years. It's what I've been fighting so hard to achieve. And now that it's becoming more possible, it's what I'll continue fighting for until it's real.\n\nOn a larger scale, my dream is to build something that I want to see in the world. One that solves a problem that is meaningful. One that reduces the suffering of others, and adds joy as well. It's not clear what that is yet. I don't believe I've exposed myself enough to life, the real problems, to the right people. I have so much of life to experience still, and there's no rush.\n",

    "content": "\nI woke up at 4 a.m. I tried to sleep more but it was too uncomfortable.\n\nI was on my phone a lot. It was the only thing in my reach that I could distract myself with.\n\nMy sister was still asleep.\n\nI started watching From up on Poppy Hill when she woke up.\n\n![From Up on Poppy Hill](/images/poppy.png)\n\nAside from the cute teen-love story and possible incest which was a dramatic turn, I loved the sense of community among the students, and their passion and spirit to retain the culture of the clubhouse (Latin Quarter) inspiring as it's rare these days. I felt like back in high school I never really cared for things, besides maybe table tennis. I never took risks. I was too insecure and just kept to myself because it was safe. Now I'm left with regrets. They serve as a good reminder for how I should live my life now.\n\nI was given a special apple juice drink only distributed in hospitals and was asked to record my water intake. I could only do 10 ml cups at first around 8 a.m. Drinking hurts. I knew pain would come in every swallow, so I braced myself for it. Hour by hour, my intake increased, first to 15, then 30, and finally 60 ml around 12 p.m.\n\nI watched a bit of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind after that. I wasn't very interested in the story at that time and stopped after a while.\n\nMy mom came around 9:30 a.m. and my sister left for work.\n\nI rewatched Spirited Away. My mom watched some of it with me. I had it playing in the background while I checked emails and tried to walk around my room. I was watching her reaction when no face was eating people. I'm surprised she wasn't showing any signs of horror, maybe it helps that it's animated.\n\nI still wasn't eating yet. I just felt nauseas. Up until 12 p.m. I've only been sipping diluted apple juice.\n\nI decided to watch \"The Wind Rises\". I wasn't really paying attention at the start, but when the earthquake scene started that's when I got hooked.\n\n![The Wind Rises (58:14)](/images/windrises.png)\n\nI loved this movie a lot. Howl's Moving Castle used to be my favorite but this one won me over. The main thing being his passion and obsession to realize his dream of making beautiful airplanes, and the repercussions of being consumed by the work you do. The realistic aspect of how your dreams have consequences, and that you have to make a lot of sacrifices and hard choices in life. The doomed love between Jiro and Naoko with pain and loss to match the joy and affection they had for each other, the marriage scene at the boss' house was gorgeous and her leaving at the end so that Jiro would be left with a good image of her was heart-wrenching.\n\nI only started eating at 2 p.m. My mom brought blended porridge. It was bright orange because of the pumpkins.\n\nI felt really impatient and frustrated. I wanted to do something with my time but I couldn't do anything.\n\nAfter waiting the entire day (12 hours for me), The doctor finally came around 4 p.m.\n\nHe told me to avoid anything with a stalk, and that I should eat lots of protein. That I should be on this diet for a month, and slowly get back to normal foods. And that it'll take 6 weeks to fully heal from the surgery. I'll be seeing him again in a week.\n\nI left the hospital around 5 p.m. into bustling area separating The Gardens and Midvalley. I walked past many restaurants and many faces. It was a saturday so everyone was out. I felt like I reentered society again. It was the same feeling I had after staying awake for 24 hours for a hackathon in SF, but this time I'm not the same anymore.\n\nYou know how in movies you see characters being stabbed, yet they can pull through and continue walking. Right now, I have two small incisions that are 2.5 cm and one 1/2 cm, and I can't even walk normally. Either I'm weak and too scared of pain, or this pain is real.\n\nMy mom was really concerned about me carrying my bag. I repeatedly told her I was fine. My dad came to pick us up and brought my mom to two grocery stores to make sure I had enough food for my recovery. She bought a lot of fish after hearing what the doctor said.\n\nI remember the bumps on the road really affected me. I felt like existence was pain. I can't feel an ounce of gratitude yet. It's all just difficult feelings swirling around in my brain. I just want this to be over.\n\nI was listening to Alain de Botton again. I feel that only his words can provide relief. It's a bit concerning I'm not reaching for God's words instead.\n\nI remember entering the house and realizing that I'm never the same. And that it's more weeks of being in the house. I dreaded it. These past two months have been quite hard, I'm undergoing so much change, but I have things to look forward to. It'll all be worth it for future me.\n\nThere are still things I want to achieve now, and I have to accept the fact that I can no longer operate at my best, and I need to rest and listen to my body. Healing will come.\n\nI spent the rest of the day writing and reading and went to bed around 11 p.m.\n",

There's nothing wrong with me. Humor is my coping mechanism.\n\nMy dad gave us a ride to Midvalley, a mall that I frequent with my mom to do some work. My sister works in the office buildings beside it, and the hospital just so happens to be beside it too. My dad took a picture of us, my sister had a small luggage with her. It felt like we were at the airport being sent off.\n\nWe went up the 7th floor and were welcomed by the words \"iHEAL Medical Center\", in dark purple, pasted neatly on the ceramic wall. I reached the main entrance of the hospital 8:19 a.m.\n\nAfter registering, and paying a hefty deposit of 20k, I was directed to my room.\n\nI was admitted to Room 3, they named it Sunflower. I'm reminded of Van Gogh's painting.\n\nI changed into the hospital gown and went outside to do an ultrasound to check if there's any complications for safety measures. While I was outside waiting, I noticed people were looking at me. Or maybe I was just being self-conscious, projecting my own ideas of insecurity about being young and sick. I wondered what goes through their mind when they see me. Could it be \"What disease does he have at such a young age that poor thing\". I took some measurements on this fancy machine. My weight increased a little to 52.9 kg. I'm going to lose more after this surgery. My target weight, according to the machine is 61 kg. Let's see if I can reach that by summer.\n\nThe lady doing my ultrasound asked what was wrong with me, and whether I was getting acid reflux frequently. She talked about how how no one can really comprehend the pain I feel, it's like being stabbed right at your lower left rib, I felt understood.\n\nA nurse took some blood for some tests. Four needles went into my arms in total, one for blood. One failed, one came off because I was sleeping on my arm and the needle bent, And the last one on my right hand for the IV drips and pain medicine.\n\nI started sketching and asked my mom to tell me about her younger days. She talked about how her family was really poor in the forest, and she ate 8 different kinds of animals/reptiles. She almost died twice when she was young. Her brother drowned in an ocean. Her father treated her the best in the family since she was the youngest, his dream was for one his children to graduate from overseas, and my mother was the one. He always made sure she had enough money, giving everything he had to his youngest daughter.\n\nAfter waiting for hours, I started reading The Bridge of San Luis Rey, after a chapter, I fell asleep. I was half-awake, resting my eyes, mentally preparing myself for what's to come. Every footstep outside my room felt like it was for me, but it was a false alarm.\n\nMy surgeon came in at one point telling me what the process will be like. I asked him for more details about the surgery. I'm in good hands.\n\nTwo nurses came in at 1 p.m. to brief me about more details. They reassured me there won't be any pain, only bloating. _I'm writing this post-op, and I'm very much in pain. Either they lied or I'm just weak._\n\nIt wasn't until 3 p.m. when the time came.\n\nI was wheeled from room to room, and finally arrived at the operation theatre, bright and cold. I was really curious, observing avery part of the room, noticing every instrument and screen in my vicinity. The nurse asked if it was like in the movies, and I said it's brighter than I thought.\n\nI moved to the operation bed, and they put a heated blanket. It felt nice. One of the nurses started conversing with me. I told her about my studies in the US, she shared about her son who has been in London the past 6 years, about his 700 pound/week rent, and his application for a masters in USC. We shared the same concerns towards the cost of US education, and how she cannot retire yet. I say my dad is in the same situation too. The anaesthesia went in my bloodstream. _I later found out this was Bridion (sugammadex sodium), and it costs RM600_.\n\nI woke up confused and in excruciating pain around 5 p.m., I couldn't breathe without my shoulders screaming and burning. I thought it was heartburn but the surgeon later told me it's because my diaphragm is swollen, and that pain travels up to the shoulders. They injected painkillers and I slept, half-awake until 6 p.m.\n\nBreathing was difficult the whole night. That made talking hard. My stomach felt like a balloon ready to burst. I've never been more uncomfortable in my life. My stomach was disapproving of everything I was trying to swallow. In every swallow, something was trying to bubble up and escape. I remember standing up to walk, and not after a few steps around the room I promptly sat back down, and started to sweat profusely.\n\nI was sulking a lot. I didn't want to go through this. I felt no gratitude. All I could think about was how long I have to suffer with this before I actually reap the benefits of this expensive and inconvenient surgery. I'm giving up an entire month. I was stressed about the interview assignment I have due soon.\n\nThe surgeon came in and told me everything went very well. He assured me that what I was feeling was normal, and that he'll see me the next morning.\n\nMy sister came around 8 p.m. from work. She looked exhausted. She's keeping me company for the night. My mom is turning 60 this year, and I'm here in a hospital bed requiring her care. She's been caring for me since I've been back. My sister said it's better to have kids early. I feel like a burden, a mixed bag of emotions involving guilt, shame, vulnerability, frustration, and gratitude with sadness. My mom left at 9 p.m.\n\nI could only take sips of soy milk that night, and I didn't eat anything else. I finished Arrietty on the TV and an episode of Friends. I could not stay awake any longer.\n\nI managed to sleep at 10 p.m. with relaxing sleep music playing on the tv.\n",

    "content": "\n![The Voyage of Life: Childhood, 1842, Thomas Cole](/images/childhood.jpeg)\n\nI don't know where to start. I sat in front of my computer for 30 minutes thinking about my life so far, reading my [past writings]([/posts/22) about how GERD has affected my life. It's really defined my entire life for the past 3 years. My entire life in the US was controlled by this disease, all of my actions and decisions had to go through it. So it's scary, yet exciting to think about how it will change from here. I see my past life ending tonight, and a new life beginning tomorrow.\n\nI got curious and started reading the wikipedia pages on [GERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease?useskin=vector) and [hiatal hernia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatal_hernia?useskin=vector). I used to read a lot of reddit posts in the beginning, but I'm not going to do that anymore because of the [90-9-1 rule](posts/90-9-1). It only adds fuel to the fire. I wasn't feeling any negative emotions as of yet but reading it conjured some amounts of anxiety.\n\n> Quality of life is improved in the short term compared to medical therapy, but there is uncertainty in the benefits of surgery versus long-term medical management with proton pump inhibitors\n\nI was informed by my surgeon that this [surgery](https://www.mayoclinic.org/fundoplication/vid-20084708.) has an 80% effectiveness rate for a 5-10 years life span. but because I have some \"wiring\" issues as well, as he puts it crudely, that 80% might go down. So a lot of uncertainty does arise in light of this information. How much will this really cure me? What does <80% look like in my day-to-day? I know there's no going back to being normal again, no restart button or revive at the checkpoint; life just doesn't work that way, our cells are constantly dying and regenerating, but at a rate that progressively declines over time. But I do expect this surgery to free me in ways I used to be, if not why am I even doing it? Well, he did say that if I continue to take medication, and since I'm southeast asian, I'm more prone to stomach cancer. So, there's that.\n\nI feel like I've been living with this disease for so long now (3.1 years) that I've accumulated a lot of [learned helplessness](posts/helplessness). I've also gotten very used to the symptoms that I'm numb to them. I feel the pain, but I'm not bothered by it as much anymore. So there's a pessimist in me that believes life will not get better. But I recently learned about the power of the expectation effect, about how our beliefs have the power to heal; we can cure the body with the mind. So I have to actively reject cynicism and believe I will be cured. Tomorrow, I will be repeating that in my head.\n\nI am afraid of this surgery. I think part of the fear comes from this permanent change to my body, a change that I cannot see with my eyes. It feels like a violation of my body. It's also a matter of trust and vulnerability. I have to fully trust the people involved my operation to make zero mistakes, and perform at their best. I'm asleep and if anything happens, I'll never know. I can't imagine how it feels to go through more major surgeries.\n\nIt's also me seeking for control and certainty, I create unnecessary anxiety by thinking past the 5-10 years timeline, when I don't even know what will happen next month, next week, and even tomorrow. I spent so much of my life planning out my entire future, setting these goals and expectations for myself, and I think I have to learn how to live day by day.\n\nI have to talk about faith. Growing up in a church, my faith and belief significantly shaped the person I am today. My core values revolve around my faith. I never realized how shaky my faith was after getting GERD. I didn't know how to accept the fact that God would put this on me, even though he only puts as much suffering as we can bear in our lives, I had a lot of doubts, and I withdrew from God, I barely attended church in 2022. 2023 was the year my faith started to revive again. I'm eternally grateful for the people at the chinese church. Today, I still struggle with putting God in the center of my life, I don't read the bible and some nights I forget to pray, so I still have a lot of work to do.\n\nTo end this on a good note, I am incredibly grateful for my friends and family. My dad who's funding all the myriads of hospital visits and operations that summed up the past two months of my disorganized and blurry life. My mom who's been caring for me physically and mentally. My sisters who are always there to cheer me up and check up on me. And the friends who brings fun and laughter into my life, who's there to listen to my messy and chaotic thoughts, who reminds me of the good times in the past, and who helps me look forward to the future.\n\nBetter days are coming. The next chapter of my life starts tomorrow.\n",

    "content": "\nI'm writing this after finishing the 20-minute technical interview for the University of San Francisco's (USF) Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program. My hands are shaky. My body overdosed on adrenaline.\n\nI believe it went well. I got linear algebra and statistics down. I was asked about concepts that I was expecting and had answers memorized. I only failed at a very easy Python function that I would easily get if it wasn't 2 a.m. and under immense amount of anxiety and pressure.\n\nTo prepare, I put everything aside and committed the past two days studying with ChatGPT, generating questions and answers, understanding the answers, rinse and repeat. To capitalize on my efforts, and to extrinsically motivate myself, I also wrote 3 Medium articles for each topic Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Python.\n\n3blue1brown's [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) helped a lot. And these two articles by BetterExplained: [An Intuitive Guide to Linear Algebra](https://betterexplained.com/articles/linear-algebra-guide/), [Vector Calculus: Understanding the Dot Product](https://betterexplained.com/articles/vector-calculus-understanding-the-dot-product/).\n\nI was anxious about this interview, and as 2 a.m. got closer, the anxiety grew stronger. I think it's because there is a lot on the line for this interview. I was terrified that one stupid mistake would obliterate my dream to be in SF.\n\nI was actively working towards ameliorating this emotion. I looked out the window, watched the palm trees sway in the dark, felt the cool wind blowing on my skin, and observed the army camp right outside my window. I started thinking about the lives of other people, how some of them are living their best lives and others their worst, how some people are stuck in lives they don't want to live, but there's nothing they can do about it, yet they accept it.\n\nI thought about how my life still goes on if things go south. And this need for things to go my way all the time is a sign of immaturity. Life will never go the way I plan it, and the sooner I accept this fact, the better. And to live on God's timing, and not my own, is an act of radical acceptance that can offer a deep, sustaining peace.\n\n> 'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. ' — Jeremiah 29:11\n\nI need to find a way to deal with the anxiety. I thought about how if I had a Google interview, how much more would this anxiety grow? It's destructive and significantly impacts my ability to perform. Taking deep breaths didn't work. Prayer didn't work too. Perhaps it's about confidence, I was feeling immense doubt on my abilities, and I'm not sure why. Staring at the Python function during the interview, I was filled with fear, my speech and thoughts were scattered. Maybe it's the tiredness. Maybe I didn't trust myself enough. Maybe I just haven't had a technical interview in a while, and the past trauma of not performing well under pressure spilled over into this interview. I need more practice. I need to believe in myself more.\n",

At the same time, there are societies that are hierarchical with a sense that the winner should take all, that mediocrity is associated with being like everyone else.\n\nIf a young person in the US says \"I'm aiming for a life where I'm in many ways, just like everybody else\", that would be seen as depressing.\n\nWe think very well of drama. Drama and melodrama. That many great things are achievable, perhaps only with a certain level of heightened activity and stress and all the rest of it.\n\nHe argues against this need to be special:\n\n> the ability to tolerate one's own averageness in many fields is the beginning of a certain sort of wisdom. And the insistence always on specialness is a kind of malignant situation.\n\nI find the idea of embracing averageness conflicting and it contradicts with my beliefs for life.\n\nFrom my exposure to the tech world in the bay and the young ambitious people I see on Twitter, I tell myself I'm capable of those things too, and all I have to do is work hard towards it. I believe I have an obligation to do great things, given my background and the opportunities provided to me through the hard work and sacrifice of my father. Embracing averageness would mean I'm not doing my part as a son, that I'm not being grateful, and I'm enjoying a life that my father never got to have.\n\nThe past two months I've had a lot of doubts and anxiety about whether I was fully utilizing my time. Not everyone has the privilege to not be in school or work, and have the time to fully pursue their interests. In moments when I get tired, I tell myself it's not the time to rest. On days where I'm not as productive, I tell myself I'm failing to meet the necessary standards. It does make me question what really drives me, how much of it is intrinsic and personal, and what I'm chasing towards.\n\nPerhaps it's also a fear of not leaving a mark on this world. If there's nothing to testify my existence on this Earth when I'm gone, was I really here? I'm sure this fear of not making an impact is universal. You can't be average yet leave an impact right? You wouldn't call Einstein or Lincoln average.\n\nIt will help to define what averageness means for me. A different perspective; maybe any average person also has the ability to change the world. I'm an average person who loves writing and building things. And if I just continue doing what I love, working on ideas that solves real problems in society, I'll end up achieving great things too.\n",

    "content": "\nToday was the last day of CNY, I met up with more high school friends.\n\nI lived in a bubble for the past few weeks. And seeing the lives of my high school friends really broke me out of that bubble. I'm left questioning what I'm doing with my life. And why my life ended up this way. I was filled with doubt. I sought after structure, certainty. They had it. I could see theirs. I want to hold it in my hands and feel mine and see it with my own eyes. But it's messy and formless, it shows up sometimes, but it dissolves. It never stays. I wish I had things that could drag me back to shore, to remind myself of my conviction.\n\nI've never been more anxious in my life.\n\nIf I don't pass this interview next Tuesday, there's no SF. There's no american dream. No startup. No FAANG. No meaning. No identity. No future.\n\nIf this surgery doesn't fix me, my life is the same, forever ruined by this disease. I'm stuck. I'm sentenced to live with this for the rest of my life. How do I live wth myself? What life is this?\n\nThese thoughts went around in cycles in my head. I was watching this movie and I believed it.\n\nAll these future events that has not happened yet, they become a reality in my head. I suffer the physical feelings. Why is my brain like this? Why do I catastrophize? Why can't I just take things one step at a time. I read all these blogs, I write about them, yet what is it all for? Do I do it for show? Is it to ease my mind, knowing I've archived my consciousness and thoughts on the internet, so there's still a part of myself when I no longer do? Why is is to hard to live with myself? With these thoughts? Who am I? What am I?\n\nExpectations and assumptions really ruined me. Today, I had a panic attack again. I haven't had one since being in Ames. They would happen late at night in bed. I can't pinpoint a single cause. It starts small, just a seed of fear planted in my head. Then comes the crescendo, the fear exponentiates. It reaches the climax, the tsunami crashes down. The symphony of anxious thoughts all implode into one major attack on my nervous system. I have no barrier or defense. I receive the full blow. I'm rendered immobile. In moments like this I lack the words to describe how I feel. I recall advice for not trusting my thoughts and just let it flow past me, but it's easier said than done. It's like you're drowning. All you can think about is breathing. But I can't breathe. It's all water. It's a dead end. I'm at the bottom, a space of nothingness, starting into the void. It all feels terribly alone.\n\nWhen this happens, I wish I had someone to call instantly. Someone who would tell me it's okay. Someone who would just listen, and help me realize that it's all in my head. That I'm watching a movie. It's hard to lie to yourself. I believe my thoughts. I'm too trusting of myself and of others. I'm easily swayed. I realize loneliness is painful. In times like this is it really better to try to understand why I'm feeling this way alone? Or do I just spiral, and get stuck in loops. I can only resort to writing. It's out of necessity. I have no other channel to process these emotions. I try to label my emotions. I try to make sense of them. But it's all a blur. It's so hard. My thoughts are messy.\n",

I love the way his mind works. Everything he says is so profound.\n\nHe talks about what a healthy mind is.\n\nA healthy mind is able to bracket.\n\nHe defines bracket as the \"ability to sequence thoughts in order of their validity to you at a particular moment so that you don't get a thought which, while true, while legitimate, has no place at a particular point in time\"\n\nHe gives the example of making a speech. Do you need the voice that says \"you're terrible at public speaking, everyone's going to laugh at you, you're going to say the wrong things\". Do you need this voice then and there? Or do you need another kind of voice, which is \"I'm going to do this and it's fine\".\n\nSo the **ability to sequence thoughts and arrange them in the way we need them arranged and do what we need to do** is an important part of mental health.\n\nAn unhealthy mind is when you're unable to tell the voice, \"yes, thank you very much, but I don't need to hear that right now\". And to create a hierarchy of what is important to know.\n\nIt also relates to the ability to be kind to oneself. There's no one truth to who a human being is. Health depends on interpreting who we are and what we happen to be doing with some of the generosity of a friend.\n\nA good friend doesn't lie to you, they won't say you're fantastic when things have messed up, but they put the most generous interpretation on whatever it is that you've done. It could be good or bad; they're not deceiving you, but they put a helpful gloss, a kind gloss.\n\nWhy does a mind get unwell. The negativity that is in everyone derives from negative experiences that simply gets too overpowering. It happens when we've exhausted the all resources to combat the darkness, the shadow inside everyone. We simply haven't been shown enough positivity for long enough to remain on the side of hope.\n\nFor these people whose attachment to the light is a bit more fragile, they need to pay more attention than others to make sure they surround themselves with voices, internal and external arguments, in favor of keeping going, in favor of sustaining themselves in life.\n",

    "content": "\nToday is the day where the next ~2 years of my life will be forever changed.\n\nI'm getting braces.\n\nI dreaded it the entire morning. I heard about how you get ulcers and cuts and that it hurts, and I wanted to back out. It's more rules, more inconveniences, and more pain. I was filled with pessimism. But I got a lot of messages from my friends this morning, and it helped tip the balance. I'm reminded that there are people out there that care. I was filled with gratitude.\n\nI continued my [100 days of Swift lessons](https://twitter.com/benxneo/status/1743458106032488839). Before I could finish, my dad was coming home to give us a ride to the dentist.\n\nIn the car, I read [the agony of eros: dating](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/the-agony-of-eros-dating?curius=1615) by Ava.\n\n> - dating is hard because it brings out all your attachment issues, problems you've inherited from your parents, primal fear of rejection, so it's really hard to fake who you are. Your true self always slips out\n> - two emotional factors to dating being less awful: self-awareness and tactful honesty\n> - people know what they want but they rarely know what they need. we have this idea of the \"ideal partner\", an amalgamation of qualities they find sexually attractive, qualities their social group values, and qualities that would flatter their ego. but they don't know what great emotional connection feels like\n> - the real thing people should be actively looking for is **strong emotional connection**: to what degree can I share who I am with this person, do they _get_ it, how interested are they with who I am, my feelings and thoughts, can we accommodate each other's preferences, are we good at talking.\n> - we're not taught how to ask hard questions of ourselves and others. we believe that social reality is more important than individual reality, that being with someone who makes you look good is better than being with someone who makes you feel good.\n> - we live in a time where we have more optionality and less transparency than ever before\n\nUpon arriving, the doctor explains that it'll take an hour and ten minutes, and it'll be boring and painless. He asks if I brought my earphones to listen to some music.\n\nFirst, he cleans my teeth a tiny electric brush and a kind of red powdery cream, then he begins explaining the glue and the UV lights that holds the metal brackets to my teeth. While he placed the brackets one by one, on each of my imperfectly positioned teeth, he starts talking about the food restrictions. No nuts, apple-like-hardness fruits, no candy, no chewing gum, no soda. I was fine with all that, but the banning of nuts was pretty upsetting because that's my go-to snack.\n\nAs he was progressed patiently teeth by teeth, and methodically completed each sections of my teeth, I slowly realize this wasn't going to be easy. I could feel the metal brackets piercing on my mouth. I had less freedom. The way I ate, spoke, and smile, they're all different now.\n\nI was listening to the podcast [How to be sad, with Helen Russell](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-be-sad-with-helen-russell/id1521559806?i=1000539118275)\n\n> - experiencing temporary sadness can counterintuitively make us happier. Sadness happens. we need to sit with it for a while, and that's normal. It helps us connect with our fellow human beings. It's an important emotion that shouldn't be ignored.\n> - in western cultures, we deal in absolutes; we think of humans as binary: happy or sad, depressed or not depressed. in east asian culture, there's an idea that you can experience more than one emotion simultaneously. You can be happy and sad in a given moment.\n> - americans are outliers in their desire to minimize negative emotions and pursue happiness. the pioneer values: the idea that go getters are people who didn't sit still with negative states, they went out there and did stuff, and are seen to prosper\n> - the idea Ubuntu philosophy: I am because you are; I cannot be content and live a fulfilled life if the people around me are suffering, are struggling. it's very much a collective social ideology, a stark contrast with the wellness rooted in individualism today.\n> - sadness is a temporary emotion you feel on occasions where you've been hurt or something is wrong in our lives. it is a message that can tell is what is wrong depression is a perpetual state of sadness, it being the only emotion you feel.\n> - Russia has dozens of words for specific types of sadness. Tosca, for ex, means great spiritual anguish. In America, it's happy, sad, and nothing.\n> - They have much more acceptance of sadness. there's no pressure to have a happy ending. No \"don't cry\", \"just smile\". If you see a child fall, instead of \"don't cry, it's okay\", it might be more helpful to say \"that must've really hurt, I can see you're in pain\" acknowledging that emotion rather than dismissing it (which leads to shame), can help the child handle it and therefore help the adult handle it.\n\nWhen he put on the wires, the pressure that distressed me the entire day began. Despair was washing over me. I didn't want to deal with this. When I'm going through moments like these, I get quiet. I have conversations with the different selves in me. I try to make sense of what I'm feeling. I try to label this emotion. Is this regret? Why am I regretting this? I wanted this for so long? Is this anger? That I just had bad genes that resulted in crooked teeth? What am I really feeling?\n\nI booked a grab home, and in the car I was scrolling through Twitter, unfollowing accounts that provide no value to me because I found out that having a low following-follower ratio boosts your account.\n\nAt home, I sought solace, a comfort to distract me from the gnawing pain that rings in my head like a sharp bell.\n\nAs I ate my blended meal, the first of many to come, I watched [Cherrien](https://www.youtube.com/@cherrienjung)'s latest [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la5BpzgkU5I). Her videos are so soothing and calming, they make me want to move to Seoul and pursue art, go to book stores and cafes, and capture all the little joys in my life.\n\nShe talks about [Just Kids by Patti Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206318521-just-kids), applauding her eloquence, which she defines as the ability to say what you want to say in a hundred different ways. I like what she said about how giving love to someone or to anything in your life is a greater gift than receiving great love, because in order to feel that much it takes a lot of spirit and sacrifice. And you learn a lot by giving and feeling love for someone or something in your life.\n\nI began to miss book stores. Vincent van Gogh shares my sentiment\n\n> “So often, a visit to a bookshop has cheered me, and reminded me that there are good things in the world.”\n\n![The Yellow Books, 1887, Vincent van Gogh](/images/books.jpeg)\n\nAfter that I watched [The Dior Book Tote Club with Rosamund Pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hxIxskjW-M) @ Hatchards Piccadilly in London\n\nShe's so classy. She mentioned the book [_Slouching Towards Bethlehem_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424.Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem) by Joan Didion which is the next on my reading list. It contains her infamous essay \"[On Self-Respect](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961)\" She regards Joan Didion as one of the most concise, pertinent observers of people, and that it's always worth spending time with her words because she was curious, and curiosity is where freedom and interest lies. She also shares [A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822858-a-little-life) as a book that will make you cry, and it's one of those books that make you think \"How did this come out of you?\"\n\nI watched another one, [The Dior Book Tote Club with Nine d'Urso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaSyeq61SZA&list=PLzPXOOq1r2gH9yO4B0a6DAVXtnpR7tuFs&index=6) @ Librairie Galignani in Paris\n\nAn interesting book in this video was [The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18185.The_Pillow_Book)\n\nSei Shonagon was a lady-in-waiting to the Empress of Japan during the Heian period. She was given some extra paper lying around and she decided to make a pillow book where she jotted down stories, memories, lists, and whatever else came into her head.\n\nSome quotes I like:\n\n> “In life there are two things which are dependable. The pleasures of the flesh and the pleasures of literature.”\n>\n> “185. It Is Getting So Dark\n> I am the sort of person who approves of what others abhor and detests the things they like.”\n>\n> “ 134. Letters are Commonplace\n> Letters are commonplace enough, yet what splendid things they are! When someone is in a distant province and one is worried about him, and then a letter suddenly arrives, one feels as though one were seeing him face to face. Again, it is a great comfort to have expressed one's feelings in a letter even though one knows it cannot yet have arrived. If letters did not exist, what dark depressions would come over one! When one has been worrying about something and wants to tell a certain person about it, what a relief it is to put it all down in a letter! Still greater is one's joy when a reply arrives. At that moment a letter really seems like an elixir of life.”\n\nThe pressure and pain was travelling to my head so I started reading.\n\nThe current book I'm reading now is [Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency by Olivia Laing](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50755102)\n\nI liked this paragraph from the introduction.\n\n> We're so often told that art can't really change anything. But I think it can. It shapes our ethical landscapes; it opens us to the interior lives of others. It is a training ground for possibility. It makes plain inequalities, and it offers other ways of living.\n\nI also finished the chapter on [Jean Michel Basquiat](https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat/all-works#!/%23filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry%23filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry). It's interesting to read about his background, his rise to fame, the cultural and racism context behind his art, and his unfortunate end. I first discovered him from UNIQLO, I had a \"Pez Dispenser\" t-shirt that I really liked. The most surprising thing was how close he was with Andy Warhol. I didn't know they collaborated on over 140 paintings, and how Warhol's death accelerated the march to his own demise as well.\n\nI need to get my hands on his [notebooks](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691167893/the-notebooks) now. It's an intimate act to look at drawings and sketches of artists, [his notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UadHeI6-tUE) includes iconic drawings and pictograms of crowns, handwritten texts, including notes, observations, and poems on culture, race, class, and his life in NYC.\n\nIt started raining really heavily. I went for my derm appointment when the rain died down. My dad came back again to give us a ride. He's been taking time out of work to give us rides and I'm very appreciative and grateful for that. I got chemical peels that made my body incinerate like blue fire kissing my skin.\n\nI ordered a grab to a township near my house. I wanted to go to Dao Desserts to get Douhua, 豆花. My mom and I walked home. She got a vege bao on the way. We saw a bunch of stray cats. I took a lot of pictures. I wanted to appreciate the little joys.\n\n![Desa Setapak](/images/desa.jpg)\n\nI came back home, ate one bowl of the Douhua, and finished my iOS lessons.\n\nI wanted to get a workout in, so I did some lifting while I watched some videos from the \"In the Library\" series by Chanel.\n\n- [Phoebe Tonkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnYhA18TuYA)\n- [Charlotte Casiraghi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8idDP1aQjIA)\n- [with Alma Jodorowsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKoTOjSt0G4)\n\nI love listening to French people, I just love the language so much. It sounds so aesthetically pleasing. It made me want to start learning French again.\n\nCharlotte's books:\n\n- [Les Fleurs du Mal by Charles Baudelaire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203220.Les_Fleurs_du_Mal): introduced her to the real world\n- [In Praise of Risk by Anne Dufourmantelle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44140954-in-praise-of-risk): Anne invites us to dive into live, to risk life, passion, love, separation\n- [The Complete Essays by Michel de Montaigne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30735.The_Complete_Essays): his writing is pleasant to read, like taking a walk. Montaigne reassures her\n- [The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson by Emily Dickinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112204.The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Dickinson): \"there's something so pure\" about them\n\nAlma's books.\n\n- [The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9717.The_Unbearable_Lightness_of_Being): \"... art and literature can help us move forward in life and provide support at certain times. This book helped me to ask lots of questions... It's a book that involves the reader a lot, and which makes us face our life choices, the paths we want to take\"\n- [Martin Eden by Jack London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/929782.Martin_Eden): \"you can't really put it down\"\n\nI ate more blended food for dinner. My family came in my room to observe my teeth and my temperament. Why was I not happy they asked. I'm still in pain, and maybe shock, disbelief.\n\nI was filled with a sense of dread the entire day, and still am as I'm writing this. I'm going to have to live with this for the next 2 years. How would my friends think of me? How would strangers think of me? How can I develop relationships if I have these metal things on my teeth that make me look like I'm 15. I start judging myself, I start to predict the future. I'm beginning to trust that voice in my head that is untrustworthy and illogical. But these thoughts are not me.\n\nThis is what I consumed today, and I realize I'm coping with pain and suffering with art and books. I discovered new books today, and reaffirmed certain books that I already wanted to read. I just want bookstores and good books now, learn about the history and lives of artists. This is my life now. I spent the past 3 hours writing this. It's a privileged life, one that I'm glad I get to live. And one I have to appreciate while it lasts. It's not an easy life, it's not easy to have to go through all this, but I'm discovering myself, I'm meeting my shadows, and I'm finding the answers to the two most important questions in life: \"who am I\" and \"what do I want\".\n",

The past was penetrating my present, gripping me tightly, refusing to let go. I was missing friends and other little objects and experiences that, together, shaped the narrative of my life for the past 2 years in the US. I couldn't appreciate the [little joys](http://bneo.xyz/posts/littlejoys) around me, the love of my family, even the treatments that I am receiving that is actually making my life better. I kept telling myself that my life in the US was better, but I realized [I couldn't trust that voice](http://bneo.xyz/posts/feelgood). It was not rational or logical. I was watching a movie playing in my head that wasn't real. I am not my thoughts. Recently, after meeting up with friends and spending more quality time with my family, I'm more in the present. I feel more grounded. I was drifting and weightless, but now I can feel the ground on under my feet.\n\nVirginia Woolf writes about the [slippery fluidity of past and present](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/05/virginia-woolf-past-present-moments-of-being/) in one of her diary entries in [Moments of Being](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60885336-moments-of-being?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1JwjzGB1yZ&rank=1).\n\n> The past only comes back when the present runs so smoothly that it is like the sliding surface of a deep river. Then one sees through the surface to the depths. In those moments I find one of my greatest satisfactions, not that I am thinking of the past; but that it is then that I am living most fully in the present. For the present when backed by the past is a thousand times deeper than the present when it presses so close that you can feel nothing else, when the film on the camera reaches only the eye. But to feel the present sliding over the depths of the past, peace is necessary. The present must be smooth, habitual. For this reason — that it destroys the fullness of life — any break causes me extreme distress; it breaks; it shallows; it turns the depth into hard thin splinters… I write this partly in order to recover my sense of the present by getting the past to shadow this broken surface. Let me then, like a child advancing with bare feet into a cold river, descend again into the stream.\n\nThe awareness of past can add great depths and richness to the current present when we're at peace, when it flows smoothly like a river. If this smoothness is broken, when we're overwhelmed by immediate concerns and distractions, the river shallows. Our deep, meaningful engagement with life, enriched by layers and experiences of the past is lost. When this happens, we must approach the present with the openness and curiosity of a child stepping into a river, and immerse ourselves in the stream of life once again.\n",

We crumble into bed at night having completed the day's to-do list yet feeling like a thoroughly incomplete human being.\n\nHermann Hesse addresses how we can heal our aching spirit in the 1905 essay titled “On Little Joys,” found in [My Belief: Essays on Life and Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/739964.My_Belief).\n\nThe neurotic obsession to spend every minute of time productively is the thief of joy.\n\n> Great masses of people these days live out their lives in a dull and loveless stupor. **Sensitive persons find our inartistic manner of existence oppressive and painful**, and they withdraw from sight… I believe what we lack is joy. The ardor that a heightened awareness imparts to life, the conception of life as a happy thing, as a festival… But **the high value put upon every minute of time, the idea of hurry-hurry as the most important objective of living, is unquestionably the most dangerous enemy of joy**.\n\nHe laments about the modern life's \"aggresive haste\" has “done away with what meager leisure we had\"\n\n> Our ways of enjoying ourselves are hardly less irritating and nerve-racking than the pressure of our work. **“As much as possible, as fast as possible”** is the motto. And so there is more and more entertainment and less and less joy… This morbid pursuit of enjoyment [is] spurred on by constant dissatisfaction and yet perpetually satiated.\n\nHe offers us a solution:\n\n> I would simply like to reclaim an old and, alas, quite unfashionable private formula: Moderate enjoyment is double enjoyment. And: Do not overlook the **little joys**!\n\nThe most overlooked and omnipresent of those joys is our everyday contact with nature.\n\nInstead of keeping our misused and overstrained eyes on screens, on the pavement, or on faces of passers-by, take notice and contemplate the small delights around you: the sky, the trees and flowers, the buildings, the streets, the squirrels, etc.\n\n> Just try it once — a tree, or at least a considerable section of sky, is to be seen anywhere. It does not even have to be blue sky; in some way or another the light of the sun always makes itself felt. Accustom yourself every morning to look for a moment at the sky and suddenly you will be aware of the air around you, the scent of morning freshness that is bestowed on you between sleep and labor. You will find every day that the gable of every house has its own particular look, its own special lighting. Pay it some heed if you will have for the rest of the day a remnant of satisfaction and a touch of coexistence with nature. Gradually and without effort the eye trains itself to transmit many small delights, to contemplate nature and the city streets, to **appreciate the inexhaustible fun of daily life**. From there on to the fully trained artistic eye is the smaller half of the journey; **the principal thing is the beginning, the opening of the eyes**.\n\nThese small joys can take many forms:\n\n> [There are] many other small joys, perhaps the especially delightful one of smelling a flower or a piece of fruit, of listening to one’s own or others’ voices, of hearkening to the prattle of children. And a tune being hummed or whistled in the distance, and a thousand other tiny things from which one can weave a bright necklace of little pleasures for one’s life.\n\nSeek out small joys:\n\n> My advice to the person suffering from lack of time and from apathy is this: **Seek out each day as many as possible of the small joys**, and thriftily save up the larger, more demanding pleasures for holidays and appropriate hours. It is the **small joys** first of all that are granted us for **recreation, for daily relief and disburdenment**, not the great ones.\n",

My dad's sister has depression and she takes meds for it, so I naturally thought I had it too. The complex pool of my genetic makeup contains bad strands that causes this mental disease (I don't know how neuroscience or biology works). I had this voice in my head that told me a lot of negative things that I just accepted them without any scepticism. I get stuck in negative loops. I thought I was broken.\n\nBut reading [this](https://evanjconrad.com/posts/how-to-feel-good) completely changed my mindset towards what \"bad\" feelings like depression and anxiety are, and how to feel good.\n\n## it's not a chemical imbalance\n\n- depression and anxiety is a software problem, not a hardware problem.\n- along with happiness and serenity, it is not outside the normal range of a healthy person\n- if you broke a bone, you wouldn't say you were \"born\" with the broken bone; breaking bones is a normal experience for healthy individuals.\n\n## you're not the voice\n\n- the voice\n  - you have a voice in your head, it's the one reading these words right now! you can make it say anything you want.\n  - you're not this voice, you're the thing hearing the voice.\n  - it says bad things, like \"you're never going to make it\" or \"this person hates me\" or \"everything sucks\"\n- the movie that's always playing\n  - a movie in your head replays conversations you wish went differently, the perfect response to an argument, or something embarrassing that happened years ago.\n  - this movie is not you, you're the thing watching the movie\n- \"cognitions\"\n  - CBT calls this voice, the movie, and other mental objects cognitions, a.k.a. thoughts\n  - you're not your thoughts, you're not thinking them, you're the thing watching the thoughts.\n  - it's why CBT refers to these thoughts as \"automatic\", these thoughts just pop in your head\n\n## the thoughts think themselves\n\n- thought exercise\n  - close your eyes and try to not think about anything\n  - give 30 seconds and your mind will wander off onto things like \"why am i doing this\", \"this is a waste of time\", \"why is it so hot?\", \"what did I have to do today?\".\n  - you try to turn off these thoughts, but the thoughts think themselves\n- this is a natural part of the human condition, and it is totally normal.\n- you may think everything \"out there\" isn't you, and everything \"in here\" is you, but that's not true. these mental objects floating around in your head are no more you than the device you're reading this on right now.\n\n## thoughts -> mood\n\n- one bad thought can spiral out of control into more and more bad thoughts that does not reflect reality\n- this is called \"Catastrophizing\"\n- in your head, you constructed a reality where a \"bad thing\" happened, your body reacts as if it truly happened. but it is not happening right now. It's just a movie\n\n## \"it's all in your head\"\n\n- people who don't understand mental health easily dismisses the physical symptoms you might be feeling by saying \"it's all in your head\"\n  - this assumes you have control over your thoughts, that you're thinking them and all you have to do is stop thinking them. But you are not your thoughts.\n- you then latch on to the belief that the problems are purely physical to justify your distress\n  - this assumes you're broken and you cannot do anything about it. But you're not broken. you're just watching these thoughts.\n\n## the skill of optionality\n\n- you can let thoughts happen and not suffer the physical feelings\n- reading about this isn't enough to make you feel better, it's a skill that you can master.\n- you're learning the ability to chose when to stop watching the movie, and when to continue.\n- people who build this skill become happier because they choose what things effect them, and how much.\n- you're a film critic\n  - saying \"just don't let it bother you\" is like asking you yo change the plot of a movie you're not in charge of.\n  - the skill here not how to change the movie, but to recognize that it is a movie.\n  - you're sitting with a notebook in hand, ready to point out the plot holes and flaws in the movie.\n\n## examine thoughts from a distance\n\n- these thoughts are habits, little feedback loops\n- feed them, they grow stronger; avoid them, they also get stronger\n- **look at them, distance yourself from them, critically examine them**. this causes the trigger but not the reinforcement that comes from the emotional response.\n- if you get better at this skill, you have less negative thoughts to deal with.\n- REMEMBER! You are not broken. There's nothing wrong with you. The thoughts aren't you. You're just watching them\n\n## step 1. don't trust your thoughts\n\n- false positives\n  - negative thoughts and emotions like fear, anger and sadness are your body's emergency management tools\n  - from an evolutionary perspective, they don't need to be 100% accurate to keep you alive, or keeping you aligned with the tribe. false positives still gets your genes across.\n  - the experience of being a modern human is having these tools fire without reason even when there are no lions in sight.\n- \"cognitive distortions\": any untrue, negative thought\n  - **mind reading**: pretend you know what someone else is thinking\n  - **fortune telling**: pretend we know what will happen in the future\n  - **all or nothing thinking**: see things in binary categories. I failed this so I will fail everything.\n  - **filtering**: focus on bad things and minimize good things.\n  - **should statements**: we think we should or ought to be one way or another. says who?\n  - **emotional reasoning**: justifying our actions and beliefs based on emotions.\n  - [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion)\n- too often we believe we \"know\" something is going to happen without evidence evidence. this is a form of magical reasoning, and one we accept from the voice all the time.\n\n## exercise #1 : catch it, check it, change it\n\n- 3 column technique\n  - #1 catch it: when a negative thought arises, write it down\n    - if the thought is more like a movie, describe it. record the emotions that appear\n  - #2 check it: truly challenge the thought. note any cognitive distortions\n  - #3 change it: write a new thought/movie that shows a more rational view of the situation\n- goals\n  - slow down: instead of catastrophizing, take a moment and see if the thought is even valid. it forces you to stop and notice what's going on and detach yourself from the rollercoaster of emotions.\n  - be a scientist: question the hypothesis of your thoughts and challenge it like a scientist. TRhis is what therapists are good at, they help you see where your logic is wrong.\n\n## exercise #2: predictions\n\n- procedure:\n  1. When you assume something bad will happen in the future, write it down. Record how bad you assume the thing will be. Record what would happen if the prediction came true and how you would feel.\n  2. set a reminder for when you expect the prediction to come true\n  3. check back to see if it happened. was it actually as bad as you thought? Did it even come true?\n- this is useful for panic attacks. they're often a sense of terrible bad things that never happen.\n- the point is to be a scientist studying yourself. you're not the anxiety, you're not the depression, you're not the panic attacks; you're just the thing watching.\n\n## you misunderstand meditation\n\n- meditation is not meant to \"calm you down\" when your emotional state is \"worked up\"\n- it's not a concentration exercise to force the mind to focus on one thing.\n- the reason to meditate is to practice seeing reality.\n  - you're getting a feel of what things are really you and what things are not\n- flow state\n  - if you sit and breathe and the thoughts float more than 30 seconds, you may hit a point where the thoughts have mostly faded away.\n  - without the mental objects to occupy your focus, the focus departs as well, like it does when you're in flow.\n  - If you don't attach yourself to the voice and the movie that tries to distract you, flow state happens all the time.\n  - it's the default state, a very good feeling, where you're not being pulled away by some thought.\n  - if the thoughts aren't there, and your observation of thoughts aren't there, you will find a \"you\" in there that is smaller than you thought.\n\n## \"small you\" and \"large you\"\n\n- \"small you\" is the entire goal. it's the observer; one that can look at the situation with empathy and kind scepticism towards the outside world, and the inside, mental world.\n- \"large you\" thinks there's no way to escape from the random thoughts that feed on your mind, and that they are you.\n- this isn't an analogy. \"small you\" is the real you. Your brain's perception of you.\n- The way to feel the \"small you\", and start to feel better, is through mindfulness.\n- mindfulness = catching thoughts as they happen, disowning them, and skeptically questioning their validity.\n\n## how to meditate\n\n- set a timer for 15-20 minutes\n- watch your breath, no need to force it\n- notice the mind wandering, noticing is the meditation.\n- watch the thoughts think themselves.\n- if you notice that your mind is wandering, gently let the thought go adn bring your attention back\n- if the voice says \"this is boring\", notice the thought, notice the boring. Then let it go\n- listen to the voices, notice the thought, examine it, hold this judgement until the timer ends.\n\n## sleep and exercise let's you play on easy mode\n\n- mental illness is a negative feedback loop where negative thoughts -> negative moods -> negative behaviours like sleeping poorly and not exercising\n- this then causes more negative thoughts, and make the emotional responses from attaching to them stronger\n\n## more resources\n\n- [Free CBT Worksheets](https://thinkcbt.com/think-cbt-worksheets)\n- [FreeCBT app](https://freecbt.erosson.org/)\n- [ThoughtRecordSheetAnxiety.pdf](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/ThoughtRecordSheetAnxiety.pdf)\n- [\"Feeling Great\" by David Burns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54930681-feeling-great)\n",

Right now we're still experimenting, but I feel a certain urgency. There's untapped potential and infinite possibilities with what we can build with LLMs. We just need to find the right idea. An idea that is new, that no one else has capitalized on. But what separates a good and great idea? A secret that no one else knows about? A company that no one else is building?\n\nThis book helped answer some questions I had, and questions I didn't know I had in the first place.\n\nAs quoted from the book: \"This book is about the questions you must ask to succeed in the business of doing new things: what follows is not a manual ora record of knowledge but ane exercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: **question received ideas** and **rethink business from scratch**.\"\n\nQuotes from the book:\n\n### 0 to 1\n\n- Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.\n- \"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?\"\n  - good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future\n  - preliminary: \"what does everybody agree on?\n- Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is even shorter supply that genius\n- Horizontal progress is globalization – taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. Vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.\n  - globalization without technology is unsustainable\n- startups\n  - a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. New thinking is the most important strength of a new company, even more important than nimbleness.\n- the first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past\n\n### Lessons from the dot com crash\n\n1. make incremental advances: small incremental steps are the only safe path forward\n1. stay lean and flexible: try things out, \"iterate\", treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation\n1. improve on the competition: improve on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors\n1. focus on product, not sales: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution\n\n### Monopoly\n\n- \"What valuable company is nobody building?\"\n  - creating value is not enough – you also need to capture some of the value you create\n- monopolist lie to protect themselves: Google framing itself as just another tech company to escape unwanted attention\n- the biggest mistake a startup can make is the bias to **understate the scale of the competition**. The fatal temptation to describe your market extremely narrow so you can dominate it.\n- non-monopolies exaggerate their distinctions by defining their markets as the intersection of various smaller markets\n- monopolists disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets\n- in a static word, a monopolist is just a rent collector. But we live in a dynamic world, creative monopolists give us more choices, they're powerful engines for making society better.\n- monopolies drive progress because their profits enable them to make long-term plans to finance ambitious research projects\n- monopoly is the condition of every successful business\n\n### competition\n\n- competition is an ideology, it pervades our society and distorts our thinking. our education system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition\n- rivalry causes you to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past\n- competition makes people hallucinate opportunities where none exists\n- recognize competition as a destructive force rather than a sign of value.\n\n### last mover advantage\n\n- moving first is a tactic, not a goal\n- it's much better to be the last mover – to make the last great developments in a specific market and enjoy years, even decades of monopoly profits.\n- business is like chess: \"to succeed, you must study the endgame before anything else\"\n- a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flow in the future\n- the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.\n- comparing discounted cash flow shows the difference between low-growth business and high growth startups at its starkest\n- tech companies lose money for the first few years: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue\n- most of a tech company's value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future\n- growth is easy to measure but durability is not\n- most important question: \"will this business still be around a decade from now?\"\n\n### characteristics of a monopoly\n\n1. proprietary technology\n   - 10x better than its closest substitute\n   - invent something completely new\n   - or radically improve an existing solution\n2. network effects\n   - product must be valuable to tis very first users when the network is necessarily small\n   - network effect business must start with especially small markets (facebook), they're so small that they don't often appear to be business opportunities at all\n3. economies of scale\n   - software startups can enjoy dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost to producing another copy of the software is close to zero.\n   - service business are especially difficult to make monopolies\n   - potential for great scale has to be built into its first design (Twitter)\n4. branding\n   - a company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition\n   - Apple has a complex suite of (1) proprietary technology in hardware and software, it manufactures products at a (2) scale large enough to dominate pricing for materials it buys. And it enjoys a strong (3) network effect from this content ecosystem: developers creating apps for Apple devices.\n   - no technology can be built on branding alone\n\n### Building a monopoly\n\n1. start small and monopolize\n   - it's easier to dominate a small market than a large one\n   - if you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is\n   - the perfect target market is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors\n2. scaling up\n   - once you dominate a niche market, you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader (adjacent) markets.\n3. don't disrupt\n   - disruption has transmogrified into a self-congratulatory buzzword for anything posting as trendy and new\n   - if your company can be summed up by it opposition to already existing firms, it can't be completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly\n   - disruption attracts attention, disruptive companies pick fights they can't win\n   - avoid competition as much as possible\n\nmore to come...\n\n### Blogs about the book\n\n- [Peter Thiel and thinking for yourself | Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/peter-thiel-thinking-for-yourself/)\n- [Why Is Peter Thiel Pessimistic About Technological Innovation? | Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/why-is-peter-thiel-pessimistic-about-technological-innovation/)\n- [Notes, ‘Zero to One’](https://www.briantimar.com/notes/zero-to-one)\n- [Eight Things I Learned from Peter Thiel’s Zero To One](https://fs.blog/peter-thiel-zero-to-one/)\n- [Book Review: Zero To One | Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/31/book-review-zero-to-one/)\n",

I'm leaving artifacts of what I was feeling at different points in my life, preserving my past selves by turning my thoughts into words. It's also therapeutic to make sense of my emotions by writing them out. I'm also capturing specific ideas from blogs and books so I can revisit them in the future and remind myself to apply them in my life. It also helps me to compartmentalize the sheer amount of blogs I have yet to read that are collecting digital dusts in my bookmark folders.\n\nI also strive to make my writing aesthetic; I've been reading more books to emulate the styles of writers that can infuse words with color and sound, reaching into the depths of my soul. By writing about personal and introspective experiences I find valuable, I can [close the taste-skill gap](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish).\n\n> “Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. **All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste**. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And **your taste is why your work disappoints you**. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and **the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work**. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will **close that gap**, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta **fight your way through**.”\n>\n> – Ira Glass\n",

I needed an outlet for release. It's building up extreme amounts of pressure inside that I'm going to explode into a million pieces if I was denied to write it.\n\nSo here's what I would've liked to answer in a perfect world where my brain works fast enough to converse normally with people and I say get to say things I truly mean.\n\n_These thoughts are pretty messy and I might come back to edit this in a future time, but it does represent how I'm feeling right now (still confused, in doubt, and lost)_\n\nHate is a strong so I don't I hate Malaysia. It's not right to hate it. It's where I was born and raised, and where my family is. I have to honor my roots and be proud of where I'm from.\n\nI have this voice in my head that urges me to become this person I'm meant to be, that I have the ability to influence and change the world just by building things. That I can work on problems that I'm passionate about that helps society, and I'm rewarded for doing what I love. Given this opportunity, how could I say no to it? Why would I be content with a life of comfort and passivity here when I can work on hard problems with great people and achieve great things, even though it's 10x or 100x more difficult and painful.\n\nTo be this person, this voice tells me I have to be in the US, specifically the Bay Area. San Francisco. After two summers in the bay, I felt really at home, even though I moved between 5 different Airbnbs, I found my people. I met people who thought about the same things I did, who shared the same passion and drive for things, who I could relate to at a deeper level. I felt like I've known them forever and I wish I met them sooner. My days were filled with excitement and drive, my weekends were full of possibilities. I made plans every week. I talked to strangers at hackathons and talks. My most vivid memory was walking the streets of SF alone for an hour searching for a ramen after spending 24 hours without sleep for an AI hackathon, talking to startup founders and MIT students, eating bags of Fritos Corn Chips, and winning a category prize.\n\n<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1bYItjcPRtxZs6Ir71O5RB?utm_source=generator&theme=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\nThese were formative experiences that made me the person I am today. There was weight to the lightness of my existence. In these 2 years, I learned more about myself than in the last 20, I was truly living. I loved life.\n\n> “Loving life is easy when you are abroad. Where no one knows you and you hold your life in your hands all alone, you are more master of yourself than at any other time” ― Hannah Arendt\n\nI am a chaotic and beautiful mix of everyone I've ever known and interacted with closely. In the words I say, the way I say them, the thoughts I have, and the actions I make, there are bits of pieces of them scattered around. Coming back left me questioning who I really was without being around them anymore. I was too attached to my life there and the people there, and that attachment left me living in the past. The infestation of longing and sadness bred into melancholy.\n\nI cling on to the accents I developed unconsciously for English and Chinese as a way to hold on to who I was. It's a coping mechanism. I'm afraid if it slips away, I slip away too. I ask myself why aren't I more Malaysian and why am I so different. And why can't I enjoy the company of my family as much as I should. I fail to see beauty in anything anymore. It's too loud and hot. The traffic annoys me. Even the people annoy me.\n\n> “You will never be completely at home again, because part of your heart always will be elsewhere. That is the price you pay for the richness of loving and knowing people in more than one place.” ― Miriam Adeney\n\nMost days I feel like I'm drifting, merely existing. Someone who's stuck in a transitory state where I no longer was and I no longer will be. I'm staring hard at the fog. It's not clearing and I don't know if I'll ever break through. I see the blurry faces and figures at shopping malls, I imagine their lives, what they could be going through, and compare my suffering inside with their outsides. They all seem fine. I find their lives boring. Malls are such a bore. I observe the sickly humans sitting and waiting at hospitals, it's reminding me of the shortness of life. Diseases strike even the best of us. The universe is under no circumstance to make sense to us. All we can do is accept our fates. Make use of it.\n\nI miss the culture. The tech culture. The hacker culture of building things, and being around builders. I miss SF. I miss museums with floors upon floors of art. Old bookstores with books that smell like stuffy libraries. I miss the people. The people who made me feel alive. My heart is still longing to be somewhere else, even with all the love from my family, it's still tied to things far away.\n\nHowever, it's been a month, and time heals all things. And I'm feeling better.\n\nThings I appreciate about Malaysia now\n\n- I get to see doctors, do braces and surgery\n- I'm given this time and freedom to explore my interests, it's a blessing to have this.\n- My best friend is here, and I'm catching up with high school friends\n- My family is loving and caring, my mom cooks for me everyday, I'm spending time with them and developing a relationship again\n- I have a nice room that I like a lot\n- I still have books to keep me company and I have time to read\n- There's good food here\n- There's more opportunities for change, more low-hanging fruits, I have to pursue my interests, there's no visa restriction or time-limit.\n- There are stray cats below my apartment unit that I get to feed and watch them grow up\n\nSome flaws in my thinking that are worth writing out to break out of the illusion\n\n- romantic perspective of SF and the bay because I was there just for summertimes, and because time was limited, things felt more meaningful, just like how death brings meaning to our lives, the shortness of it made it sweeter\n- I can explore tech scene in malaysia too, I could even build a startup here.\n- I wasn't healthy so coming back was necessary, I might've been miserable if I stayed\n- I can continue to make friends here and stop living in the past, there are cool people here. I just need a way to find them. Luminary is my way of doing that.\n",

Because you’re utterly **habituated to steady progress—to completing things**, to producing, to solving. When progress is subtle or slow, when there’s no clear way to proceed, you flinch away. You redirect your attention to something safer, to something you can do. **You jump to implementation prematurely**; you feel a compulsion to do more background reading; you obsess over tractable but peripheral details. These are all **displacement behaviors**, ways of not sitting with the problem. Though each instance seems insignificant, the cumulative effect is that your stare rarely rests on the fog long enough to penetrate it. Weeks pass, with apparent motion, yet you’re just spinning in place. You return to the surface with each glance away. **You must learn to remain in the depths**.”\n\nI'm not at the stage of my life where I'm doing research that requires this level of depth, but I took away some ideas and tips that I want to implement in my life\n\n- flinching away\n  - you flinch away from slow progress because you set faulty expectations, reinforce a more realistic pace of progress by collecting vivid stories (i.e. memoirs of scientists)\n  - [Mentally note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_noting?useskin=vector) impulses as they arise, catch them as early as possible\n  - the best work is the product of perseverance and unchartable paths, not the result of an impulse to produce \"output\"\n- curiosity\n  - shift your stance of work as a landscape to explore rather than a destination to reach (a task to accomplish)\n    - do this by asking lots of questions, imagine potential implications\n    - improve the framing, find one which expresses what you're deeply excited about\n  - react to setbacks from curiosity; instead of frustration, it becomes: \"Oh, wait, wow! Fascinating! What is happening here? What can this teach me? How might this change what I try next?\"\n- morning block\n  - do deep work in one giant, unbroken block in the morning\n  - block displacement activities (email, Twitter) with extensions, apps or focus modes\n  - depth of concentration is cumulative, and precious. An extra hour or two of depth is enormously valuable. (6 hour morning blocks > 10 hour day)\n  - From memoirs of writers, artists, and scientists, 2-4 hours is the norm for primary creative working block.\n  - most people are laughably misled about how much time they truly work\n  - longer working intervals produce deeper focus in the morning, and shorter ones, towards the evening.\n- on breaks\n  - intermittent short breaks – 5 minutes, not 15 or 30 – helps depth of concentration enormously\n  - long hours of focus -> more and more willpower to maintain concentration until the pressure builds up, and you give in to distraction to release it\n  - don't do anything cognitive during break (no reading, or thinking about another topic, and NO PHONES). It imposes higher switching cost. Do simple house chores. Talk to friends and family.\n  - 15-second meditations and body scans can help shift from a break into a new working interval.\n- music\n  - play energetic music if you're feeling sleepy (you're expecting more stimulation than you're getting, compensate with music)\n  - play something subdued, repetitive, and non vocal for difficult work\n- let the mind wander\n  - regularly listening to podcasts when walking can contribute to an **internal expectation for constant stimulation**, let the mind wander. Listen when exercising or cooking instead.\n",

You can adopt practices that increase your intelligence.\n\nWhy don’t more people to it?\n\nBecause thinking hard takes effort.\n\nIts much easier to stop at an answer that makes sense. Or stop when you think you already understand something, when you actually don’t.\n\nThink of college students who race through difficult concepts week after week in class pressured to learn the rules and operations so they’re not left behind in the current. They’re not offered time to think deeply and test their own understanding by attacking it from multiple angles. They’re not incentivized to stop and think why this equation looks the way it does. They’re not rewarded for going down into an endless series of rabbit holes to pursue everything that they don’t fully understand.\n\nIt also requires intrinsic motivation. And motivation is hard to come by. Energy is a scarce resource.\n\nYou have to motivate yourself to expend large amounts of energy on a problem, which on some level means not understanding something should bother you a lot. You have the drive, the will to know.\n\n## 2. Honesty\n\nThe second quality is **honesty, or integrity**, an inability to lie to yourself.\n\nFeynman said the first rule of science is that you do not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\n\nIt's easy to lie to yourself, no one else is holding you accountable for your own understanding, only you can recursively ask yourself \"Do I really understand this?\"\n\nThis is why writing is important. Writing is thinking, you can't lie to yourself because the thoughts will come out all messy and disorganized if you lack understanding. Writing forces clarity.\n\n## 3. Experimentation\n\nThey third is they understand through **experiments**.\n\nPhysicist Michael Faraday always had to repeat, and perhaps, extend the experiments of others to assess their work. Hearing or reading was never enough for him. This lifelong habit is what led to his discovery of electromagnetism.\n\nNothing beats direct experience. If you start with somebody's lossy compression of a messy, evolving phenomenon, you're just resurfacing cached thoughts and narratives. But if you're hands-on, starting from scratch, you develop basis in reality, and reason up from there. You're closer to generating truth.\n\nUnderstanding something deeply is connected to physical intuition. A simple text-based understanding can only go so far. You need to be able to visualize, in three dimensions, so your brain can grasp onto something to use as a model.\n\nGenerating concrete examples, even if you're not physically doing experiments is crucial. If you're learning things in the usual dry mathematical way, force yourself to come up with visualizations, you'd be much further than others in true understanding.\n\n## 4. \"I don't understand\"\n\nLastly, they're **unafraid to look stupid**.\n\nLooking stupid takes courage, it's always easier to just let things slide.\n\nAsk the most obvious question. Don't care if it sounds foolish. Don't feel guilty for slowing the group down. It's likely nobody else understands what is going on, but they're too afraid to ask.\n\nSaying \"I don't understand\" and asking sincerely is a habit you can pick up, and it can make you smarter.\n\n## Go slow\n\nFor people trying to understand something, **go slow**.\n\nRead slowly, think slowly, really take time contemplating the thing.\n\nThink about the questions yourself before reading a bunch of stuff about it. Spending time continuously pondering about a question can get you surprisingly far.\n\nFor example, Bill Gates structures his \"reading weeks\" around an outline of important questions broken down into pieces. \"water scarcity\" can be broken down into -> \"How much water is there in the world?\", \"where does existing drinking water come from?\", \"how do you turn ocean water into drinking water\", etc. and then he picks reading to address those questions.\n\n## Get closer\n\nUnderstanding is not a binary \"yes/no\". It has layers of depth\n\nWhen in doubt, go closer.\n",

There's a Buddhist shrine to my left occupying most of the living room, Chinese New Year cookies neatly arranged in cylindrical containers with red caps were scattered across the coffee tables; my other cousins were in the room, still too young to understand what burnout is. Red packets were distributed today. It was a dangerously hot day, I was melting. The AC kept my body, and my mind calm.\n\nI learned about [The Burnout Society](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25490360-the-burnout-society?ref=nav_sb_ss_5_7) while watching a video on the [Overthink podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qikrYBd4tw) channel. I was intrigued by the ideas discussed by Prof. Ellie and felt impelled to read it. It also helped that it's only 60 pages long. I love reading short books.\n\nThis was my first philosophical reading, so quickly got lost reading this book, especially towards the end. A large portion of the book involved referencing other philosophical work, with jargons like the Self as positive and the Other as negative, Homo Sacer, Ego and Superego, Vita Activa and Vita Contemplita, etc.\n\nNonetheless, there were ideas in this book that made me doubt my life philosophy and shook me out of my current my way of living.\n\nI was relentlessly pushing for achievement, constantly thirsting for productivity, for self-optimizing time and energy to maximize output, trying to complete (everything) now instead of later. This made me restless, I felt like I always had to be doing something. I felt an intense pressure to achieve. I fundamentally believed this was a necessary trait to be successful, if you're always doing, building, creating, that means you create more opportunities for your future self, and live a better (future) life. But I never realized I wasn't living the now, the present moment, the little things that make up my life. I was a self-exploiting achievement-subject in an achievement society.\n\nMy biggest lesson from the book is **we lack the power not-to do something**. We're driven to always be doing, doing, doing. We yield to every stimulus and desire, we fill up the quiet moments of our lives with noise and activity, destroying any opportunity for deep contemplation, idleness and boredom. We deny ourselves freedom, action, and creativity. We've become exhausted animals who can do nothing but toil for mere survival. We are simultaneously perpetrator and victim, the master and the slave.\n\nWe need to make more time to be [doing nothing](https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb), and practice the ability to not-do. That means resisting the urge to escape boredom and reach for the stimulation of our devices; sit with the feeling of boredom, make friends with it, and it will show you the hidden secrets behind everything. We owe our cultural achievements to \"deep boredom\", which Walter Benjamin describes as a \"dream bird that hatches the egg of experience\".\n\nThis ability to not-do leads to a contemplative life - [vita contemplativa](https://the-philosophers-shirt.com/blogs/philosophical-dictionary/vita-activa-versus-vita-contemplativa). Through contemplation, we marvel at the way things are. We step outside of ourselves, and immerse in the surroundings. What is fleeting and inconspicuous reveals itself to us. Without this contemplative composure, we find expression for nothing; and art is \"expression action\".\n\nNietzsche knew that human life ends in deadly hyperactivity when very contemplative element is driven out.\n\n> \"From lack of repose our civilization is turning into a new barbarism. At no time have the active, that is to say restless, counted for more. That is why one of the most necessary corrections to the character of mankind that have to be taken in hand is a **considerable strengthening of the contemplative element** in it.\"\n\nBelow are quotes from the book I captured.\n\n### excess positivity\n\n- \"Obesity of all current systems\" of information, communication, and production.\n- Neurological illnesses such as depression, borderline personality disorder, ADHD, burnout mark the landscape of pathology at the beginning of the 20th century. They are not infections, but infarctions (blockage of arteries).\n- They point to excess of positivity.\n- The hyper in hyperactivity represents the massification of the positive\n- Violence of positivity that derives from overproduction, overachievement, and overcommunication. It does not deprive, it saturates; it does not exclude, it exhausts\n\n### Achievement society\n\n- Today's society is no longer Foucault's disciplinary society, the 21st century is an achievement society\n- The switch from the negative Should to the positivity of Can\n- Can increases the level of productivity\n- Achievement-subjects are entrepreneurs of themselves\n- Unlimited Can is the positive modal verb of achievement society.\n- \"The depressed individual is unable to measure up; he is tired of having to become himself\" – Ehrenberg\n- Depression also follows from impoverished attachment, a characteristic of the increasing fragmentation and atomization of life in society\n- It is not the imperative only to belong to oneself, but the pressure to achieve causes exhaustive depression\n- Burnout syndrome does not express the exhausted self so much as the exhausted, burnt-out soul.\n- It is not the excess of responsibility and initiative that makes one sick, but the imperative to achieve: the new commandment of late-modern labor society\n- The complaint of the depressive individual \"Nothing is possible\" can only occur in a society that thinks \"Nothing is Impossible\"\n- depression is the sickness of society that suffers from excess positivity. It reflects humanity waging war on itself\n- The achievement-subject gives itself over to compulsive freedom – the free constraint of maximizing achievement\n- Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation\n\n### Boredom\n\n- Excess positivity is an excess of stimuli, information, and impulses.\n- \"Multitasking\" does not represent civilizational progress. It amounts to regression. It is commonplace among wild animals. An attentive technique required for survival in the wilderness\n- Animals are incapable of contemplative immersion either they are eating or they are copulating\n- Activities such as video games produce a broad bu flat mode of attention, similar to the vigilance of a wild animal.\n- We owe cultural achievements of humanity to deep, contemplative attention. Culture presumes an environment in which deep attention is possible.\n- immersive reflection is being displaced by hyperattention: a rash change of focus between different tasks, sources of information, and processes\n- Profound idleness that benefits the creative process. Walter Benjamin calls this deep boredom \"dream bird that hatches the egg of experience\"\n- if sleep represents the high point of bodily relaxation, deep boredom is the peak of mental relaxation.\n- Boredom is a \"warm gray fabric on the inside, with the most lustrous and colorful skills\"; \"in this fabric we wrap ourselves when we dream.\" We are \"at home ... in the arabesques of its lining\"\n- The \"gift of listening\" is based on the ability to grant deep, contemplative attention – which remains inaccessible to the hyperactive ego\n- Viva Contemplativa: it connects to the experience of being in which what is beautiful and perfect does not change or pass\n- the basic mood: marvel at the way things are, nothing to do with practicality or processuality\n- Cartesian doubt has taken the place of wonder\n- Whatever is floating, inconspicuous, or fleeting reveals itself only to deep, contemplative attention.\n- in a contemplative state, one steps outside oneself and immerses oneself in the surroundings\n- Paul Cezanne, master of deep, contemplative attention could \"see the fragrance of things\". His contemplative mode of observing a landscape as a kind of externalization or de-interiorization \"The landscape thinks itself in me\" \"and I amn its consciousness\"\n- Without contemplative composure, the gaze errs restlessly and finds expression for nothing\n- art is \"expressive action\"\n- Nietzshe: human life ends in deadly hyperactivity when every contemplative element is driven out\n  - \"From lack of repose our civilization is turning into a new barbarism. At no time have the active, that is to say restless, counted for more. That is why one of the most necessary corrections to the character of mankind that have to be taken in hand is a considerable strengthening of the contemplative element in it.\n\n### Vita Contemplita\n\n- Hannah Arendt: Modern society as a society of \"laboring\" – nullifies any possibility for action when it degrades the human being into animal laborans, a beast of burden.\n- Modern humanity passively stands at the mercy of anonymous process of living. Thinking degrades into calculation, mer cerebral functioning.\n- Modern loss of faith does not concern just God or the hereafter. It involves reality itself and makes human life radically fleeting. Life has never been as fleeting as it is today. Not just human life, but the world is becoming radically fleeting. Nothing promises duration or substance.\n- A society of work in which the master himself has become a laboring slave. In this society of compulsion, everyone carries a work camp inside. One is simultaneously prisoner and guard, victim and perpetrator.\n\n### Seeing\n\n- Nietzsche formulates three tasks for which pedagogues are necessary. One needs to learn to see, to think, and to speak and write.\n- Learning to see means \"getting your eyes used to calm, to patience, to letting things come to you\" – that is, making yourself capable of deep and contemplative attention, casting a long and slow gaze\"\n- Such learning-to-see represents the first preliminary schooling for spirituality.\n- One must learn \"not to react immediately to a stimulus, but instead to take control of the inhibiting, excluding instincts\"\n- Reacting immediately, yielding to every impulse, already amounts to illness and represents a symptom of exhaustion.\n- _Vita contemplativa_ is not a matter of passive affirmation and being open to whatever happens. Instead, it offers resistance to crowding, intrusive stimuli\n- Hyperactive intensification leads to an abrupt switch into hyperpassivity; now one obeys every impulse or stimulus without resistance. Instead of freedom, it produces new constraints\n- We live in a world that is very poor in interruption; \"betweens\" and \"between-times\" are lacking\n- delaying proves necessary if action is not to sink to the level of laboring. Activity that follows an unthinking, mechanical course is poor in interruption. Machines cannot pause. Despite its enormous capacity for calculation, the computer is stupid insofar as it lacks the ability to delay.\n- Negative potency: the power to not do, a.k.a the power to say no\n  - If one only possessed the positive ability to perceive (something) and not the negative ability to not perceive (something), one's senses would stand utterly at the mercy of rushing, intrusive stimuli and impulses. In such a case, no \"spirituality\" would be possible. If one had only the power to do (something) and no power to not do, it would lead to fatal hyperactivity. If one had only the power to think (something), thinking would be impossible to think back and reflect, for positive potency, the preponderance of positivity, only permites anticipation and thinking a head.\n\n### society of tiredness\n\n- society of achievement and activeness is generating excessive tiredness and exhaustion\n- tiredness in achievement society is solitary tiredness, it has a separating and isolating effect.\n- Peter Handke, \"Essay on Tiredness\" calls it \"divisive tiredness\": \"Already the two ... were irresistibly recoiling, each into ... private tiredness, not ours, but mine over here and yours over there\"\n- Tiredness of this kind proves violent because it destroys all that is common or shared, all proximity, and even language itself.\n- eloquent, seeing, reconciliatory tiredness in opposition to speechless, sightless, divisive tiredness (I-tiredness: \"solitary tiredness\")\n- \"fundamental tiredness\" is not a state of exhaustion where one is unable to do anything. Instead, it represents a singular capacity. It allows spirit/intellect to emerge. It is tiredness that of negative potency, namely of not-to\n- \"we-tiredness\" : I am tired \"with you\"\n- \"A cloud of tiredness, an ethereal tiredness, held us together then\"\n- The sabbath, originally a word that meant stopping, is a day not-to, Heidegger: it is a day free of all in-order-to, of all care.\n- a day on which use of the useless proves possible\n- it is a day of tiredness. The interval is a time without work, a time of, and for, play.\n- A time of peace. Tiredness is disarming. In the long, slow gaze of the tired person, resolution yields to a state of calm\n\n### Burnout society\n\n- the \"sovereign man\" is a man of leisure\n- A hyperactive person would've disgusted Nietzsche: the \"strong soul\" keeps \"calm\", \"moves slowly\", and \"has an aversion to what's too lively\"\n- in Thus Spoke Zarathustra: \"All of you who are in love with hectic work and whatever is fast, new, strange – you find it hard to bear yourselves, your diligence is escape and the will to forget yourself. If you believed more in life, you would hurl yourself less into the moment. But you do not have enough content in yourself for waiting – not even laziness!\"\n- The capitalist economy absolutizes survival. It is not concerned with the _good_ life.\n- it is sustained by the illusion that capital produces more life, which means a greater capacity for living.\n- Concern about living the good life yields to hysteria of surviving\n- The reduction of life to biological, vital processes makes life itself bare and strips it of all narrativity. It takes livingness from life, which is more complex than simple vitality and health.\n- Given the atonmization of society and the erosion of the social, all that remains is the body of the ego, which is to be kept healthy at any cost. The loss of ideal values leaves, other than the exhibition value of the ego, only health value behind. Nietzsche's last nam declares Health is the new goddess after the death of God \"one honors health. \"We invented happiness\" say the last human beings, and they link\"\n\n## Blogs covering this book\n\n- [The Burnout Society | A Working Library](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/burnout-society)\n- [The Burnout Society - by aj - Apposition](https://apposition.substack.com/p/the-burnout-society)\n- [Byung-Chul Han’s Burnout Society: Our Only Imperative is to Achieve | Philosophy Break](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/byung-chul-han-burnout-society-our-only-imperative-is-to-achieve/)\n- [Book: The Burnout Society by Byung-Chul Han — nutcroft](https://nutcroft.com/blog/book-the-burnout-society-by-byung-chul-han/)\n",

    "content": "\nLately I've been reading a lot, or more than I used to.\n\nI only read 3 books last year, an unfortunate state of affairs. This year, my goal is to [read 24 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/51487655). It's early February and I've already read 4. So I'm making good progress!\n\nThe way I've been reading [analytically](https://fs.blog/the-art-of-reading-analytical-reading/) is I scribble notes and thoughts in the margin, underline words that have specific utility and meaning to me, and writing short summarize at the end of each chapter. Then, once I've arrived at the end, completing the journey with the final few words on the last page, I capture quotes that help me cling to the ideas exuded from the books. That's my method for \"summarizing\" books.\n\nI've been reading books that are relevant to my life right now. I read [Proust](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/proust) because it involved themes of suffering and love. I read [Frankl](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/meaning) because I wanted to make sense of my suffering and answer the big question of \"what is meaning of life?\". I read [Elements of Style](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/elementsofstyle) on a whim because I wanted to improve my writing. And I read [Rilke's letters](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/rilkeletters) to Kappus because it reminds me to let life take its course, to embrace solitude, and to live the questions. Right now, I'm reading \"Burnout Society\" because given my neuroticism, I burn out easily, and I'm hoping to find a solution.\n\nMortimer Adler, in \"[How to Read A Book](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/)\", discusses four levels of reading. The fourth is syntopical reading, which is reading books around the same topic.\n\nI propose Existential reading, reading books around with themes, ideas, challenges that are revolving around one's life.\n\nOne thing I want to do is reread these books. Good books should be read twice or more. I believe that is more important than summarizing books.\n\nGood reading is rereading. You can't really understand a book deeply on first reading because you lacked the ground to stand on and the benefit of retrospection. Rereading helps you focus on details you missed the first time.\n\nI like Susan Rigetti's method for studying [philosophy](https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy):\n\n- **First read**: Read casually, as if you’re reading a novel or a newspaper or magazine article. Your goal here is simply to observe, not to engage (yet).\n- **Second read**: This time, read to understand. Take notes. Ask yourself, “what does the author really mean here?” Summarize things in your own words. Try to break down the arguments being presented into bullet points, identifying the premises and the conclusions. When you read a term you are unfamiliar with or want to understand better, google it or look it up in the SEP.\n- **Third read**: Read again, and this time engage with the text. Go back to your notes, where you identified the arguments being presented. Think of arguments in favor of what the author is saying and arguments against. Think of counterexamples.\n- **Fourth read**: Now read for one last time. Read casually, the way you did in the first read. Notice how your understanding of the text is now so much richer and deeper than it was on the first read.\n\nAnother thing I want to be better at is instead of just [summarizing](https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries) books. I want to remix ideas, and write them in my own words. I want to really think deeply for myself about what I read. That's when the learning happens, by applying it to the context of my life. My mind is a living collection of memories and ideas that are birthing, dying and rebirthing, simultaneously, every second of my fragile existence.\n",

Sound travels farther at night. It was nearing midnight. It's Chinese New Year.\n\nThis was my first introduction to Rilke, I remember reading a quote of his on the internet and I was helplessly forced to read the book.\n\nThe Marginalian writes: \"I consider Letters to a Young Poet a foundational text of our civilization and a life-necessity for every human being with a firing mind and a beating heart\"\n\nAlthough these were letters written to a poet, the advice applies much more generally than someone who wants to become a poet. For Rilke, to be an artist was to live one's life properly – the artistic and existential were inseparable.\n\nAt this stage of my life when I'm filled with doubts about my personal identity and plans, feeling solitude in its many forms and flavor, desperately seeking answers to the questions and confusions about love, consumed by fear and debilitating anxiety about my diseases and about the future, experiencing and making sense of pain and suffering, exploring the joys of studying and making art and the craft of writing, these letters were intimately comforting, it felt like they were written for me.\n\nBelow are some quotes that I want to take away from the book. I made a lot of underlines reading his letters, and I'll be rereading this book a few times more in my lifetime given how it's just 10 short letters, and how enjoyable it was to read it.\n\n## [Solitude](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/)\n\n> What (you might ask yourself) would a solitude be that didn’t have some greatness to it? For there is only one solitude, and it is large and not easy to bear. It comes almost all the time when you’d gladly exchange it for any togetherness, however banal and cheap; exchange it for the appearance of however strong a conformity with the ordinary, with the least worthy. But perhaps that is precisely the time when solitude ripens; its ripening can be painful as the growth of a boy and sad like the beginning of spring… **What is needed is only this: solitude, great inner solitude**. Going within and meeting no one else for hours — that is what one must learn to attain. To be solitary as one was as a child. As the grown-ups were moving about, preoccupied with things that seemed big and important because the grown-ups appeared so busy and because you couldn’t understand what they were doing.\n\n> Don’t let your solitude obscure the presence of something within it that wants to emerge. Precisely this presence will help your solitude expand. People are drawn to the easy and to the easiest side of the easy. But it is clear that we must **hold ourselves to the difficult**, as is true for everything alive. Everything in nature grows and defends itself in its own way and against all opposition, straining from within and at any price to become distinctively itself. It is good to be solitary, because solitude is difficult, and that a thing is difficult must be even more of a reason for us to undertake it.\n\n## [Sadness](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/10/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-sadness/)\n\n> You have had many and great sadnesses, which passed. And you say that even this passing was hard for you and put you out of sorts. But, please, consider whether these great sadnesses have not rather gone right **through the center of yourself**? Whether much in you has not altered, whether you have not somewhere, at some point of your being, undergone a change while you were sad? … Were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches, and yet a little way beyond the outworks of our divining, perhaps we would endure our sadnesses with greater confidence than our joys. For they are the moments when something new has entered into us, something unknown; our feelings grow mute in shy perplexity, everything in us withdraws, a stillness comes, and the new, which no one knows, stands in the midst of it and is silent.\n\n> We cannot say who has come, perhaps we shall never know, but many signs indicate that the future enters into us in this way in order to transform itself in us long before it happens. And this is why it is so important to **be lonely and attentive when one is sad**: because the apparently uneventful and stark moment at which our future sets foot in us is so much closer to life than that other noisy and fortuitous point of time at which it happens to us as if from outside.\n\n> The **more still**, **more patient** and **more open** we are when we are sad, **so much the deeper and so much the more unswervingly does the new go** into us, so much the better do we make it ours, so much the more will it be our destiny, and when on some later day it “happens” (that is, steps forth out of us to others), we shall feel in our inmost selves akin and near to it. And that is necessary. It is necessary — and toward this our development will move gradually — that nothing strange should befall us, but only that which has long belonged to us.\n\n> So you must not be frightened … if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloud-shadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that **something is happening with you**, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand; it will not let you fall. **Why do you want to shut out of your life any agitation, any pain, any melancholy**, since you really do not know what these states are working upon you?\n\n## [Writing](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/04/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-writing/)\n\n> Nobody can counsel and help you, nobody. There is only one single way. **Go into yourself**. **Search for the reason that bids you write**; find out whether it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places of your heart, acknowledge to yourself whether you would have to die if it were denied you to write.\n\n> This above all — ask yourself in the stillest hour of your night: **must I write?** Delve into yourself for a deep answer. And if this should be affirmative, if you may meet this earnest question with a strong and simple “I must,” then build your life according to this necessity; your life even into its most indifferent and slightest hour must be a sign of this urge and a testimony to it.\n\n> **A work of art is good if it has sprung from necessity**. In this nature of its origin lies the judgment of it: there is no other.\n\n## [Patience](https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/06/22/rilke-patience-solitude-art/)\n\n> Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree which does not force its sap and stands confident in the storms of spring without the fear that after them may come no summer. It does come. But it comes only to the patient, who are there as though eternity lay before them, so unconcernedly still and wide. I learn it daily, learn it with pain to which I am grateful: **patience is everything!**\n\n## [Reading](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/12/04/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-reading/)\n\n> A world will come over you, the happiness, the abundance, the incomprehensible immensity of a world. **Live a while in these books**, learn from them what seems to you worth learning, but above all **love them**. This love will be repaid you a thousand and a thousand times, and however your life may turn, — it will, I am certain of it, run through the fabric of your growth as one of the most important threads among all the threads of your experiences, disappointments and joys.\n\n## [Doubt](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/06/01/rilke-on-questions/)\n\n> I want to beg you, as much as I can, dear sir, to be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and to try to **love the questions** themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. <mark>Live the questions</mark> now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.\n\n> Your doubt may become a good quality if you **train it**. It must become knowing, it must become critical. Ask it, whenever it wants to spoil something for you, why something is ugly, **demand proofs from it**, **test it**, and you will find it perplexed and embarrassed perhaps, or perhaps rebellious. But don’t give in, insist on arguments and act this way, watchful and consistent, every single time, and the day will arrive when from a destroyer it will become one of your **best workers** — perhaps the cleverest of all that are building at your life.\n\n## [Love](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/01/29/rilke-on-love/)\n\n> To love is good too, for love is difficult. For one person to care for another, that is perhaps the **most difficult thing required of us, the utmost and final test**, the work for which all other work is but a preparation. With our whole being, with all the strength we have gathered, we must learn to love. This learning is ever a committed and enduring process.\n\n> To love is not about merging. It is **a noble calling for the individual to ripen, to differentiate**, to become a world in oneself in response to another. It is a great, immodest call that singles out a person and summons them beyond all boundaries. Only in this sense may we use the love that has been given us. This is humanity’s task, for which we are still barely ready.\n\n> This more human love (endlessly considerate and light and good and clear, consummated by holding close and letting go) will resemble that love that we so arduously prepare — the love that consists of **two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other**.\n",

The unrooted man is the unremembered man, because he’s uncommitted to things.\n  - Freedom is not an ocean you want to swim in, it’s a river you want to get across, so you can commit and plant yourself on the other side.\n- #2 You can either be broken, or **be broken open**\n  - <mark>Pain that is not transformed gets transmitted</mark>\n  - Suffering’s great power is that it’s an interruption of life. It reminds you you’re not the person you thought you were.\n  - Theologian Paul Tillich: \"what suffering does is it carves through what you thought was the floor of the basement of your soul, and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below, and it carves through that, revealing a cavity below\".\n  - you discover two things at this depth\n    - your heart years for fusion with another\n    - your soul years for righteousness\n- #3 expand your consciousness\n  - “The problem you have is not going to be solved at the level of consciousness on which you created it. You have to expand to a different level of consciousness.” – Einstein\n\nHow do you get out of the valley?\n\n- throw yourself on friends and have deeper conversations\n- go out alone into the wilderness, go where there's nobody there to perform, and the ego has nothing to do, and it crumbles, and only then are you capable of being loved\n\nhappiness vs joy\n\n- Happiness is the expansion of self\n  - you win a victory, you get a promotion\n- Joy is the dissolving of self\n  - It’s the moment where you’re so lost in your work or a cause, you have totally self-forgotten.\n",

The way real science goes is that you come up with lots of ideas, and most of them will be wrong. — Francis Crick\n\nA few prompts to trigger new, better ideas, by [A Smart Bear](https://longform.asmartbear.com/extreme-questions/)\n\n- **10x prices**: If you were forced to increase your prices by 10x, what would you have to do to justify it?\n- **no Customers**: If all our customers vanished, and we had to earn our growth and brand from scratch, what would we do?\n- **no tech support**: If you were never allowed to provide tech support, in any form, what would have to change?\n- **maximize fun**: What would be the most fun thing to build?\n- **complete rip-off**: If our biggest competitor copied every feature we have, how would we still win?\n- **no time**: What if we are forced to ship a full, completed MVP (or actually, SLC) new feature, in just two weeks, that would delight and surprise some fraction of our customers.\n- **flipped business model**: What if you were forced to charge customers in a completely different manner? The product isn’t free, but somehow you have to justify value (and costs) differently. If you’re usage-based, you’re forced to charge a flat monthly rate; if monthly with tiers, you’re forced to measure and charge daily with some formula.\n- **no website**: If you were not allowed to have a website, how would you still grow your business?\n- **no meetings**: What if you made your most introverted teammates’ dreams come true: No more synchronous meetings, ever again?\n- **no customer contact**: If we could never talk to our customers again, how would we figure out what to build?\n- **cost is no object**: What if it didn’t matter how unprofitable you were?\n- **sociopathic ceo**: What if you could change anything, regardless of what anyone thinks or feels?\n- **mortal would**: What externality has the potential to kill the entire company?\n- **philanthropist**: What if our only goal were to create the most good in the world, personally for our customers?\n- **only one thing this year**: What if you could only ship one thing this year?\n",

Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption — a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but barely goes anywhere. Stuck in the fury of the present, we’re swept up in dizzying chaos like leaves in a gale-force wind. Even though on the Internet, we’re just a click away from the greatest authors of all time, from Plato to Tolstoy, we default to novelty instead of timelessness.\n\nI scroll Twitter a lot these days. I feel the urge to keep up, to be constantly fed with the latest tech news or I'll shrivel and waste away, as if learning about how this company open-sourced another small model that performs better than GPT-4 on benchmarks will provide the life force to keep me alive. Perhaps I'm foraging for patterns and data, learning how to grow my account to 1k followers and achieve [success](https://near.blog/how-to-twitter-successfully/?curius=1935). Or I'm purely escaping the distress of difficult tasks requiring high intensity of attention and focus. Instead of filling up the brief moments in between of work and \"non-work\" with more stimuli and information on a fatigued brain high on cognitive load, I should be looking out the window, staring at the corner of the ceiling, chat with my parents, or just pause the Spotify player that's constantly streaming vibrations into my ear like it's my lifeline, and close my eyes and take a deep breath.\n\nThe question posed by David is \"How can you prioritize the accumulated wisdom of humanity over the impulses of the past 24 hours?\"\n\nCould it be a matter of values and [agency](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/1154dba1-49f6-4feb-b091-6d4a7eefa94d?curius=1419)?\n\nWhat differentiates a person who scrolls on an endless feed of social media and someone who blocks out time daily to read books like \"Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium\"?

    "content": "\n![\"Young Woman Writing\" by Pierre Bonnard (1908)](/images/womanwriting.png)\n\nI couldn't do anything today, so I decided to read. I wanted to read about writing, because I want to write well. So I read this book on my MacBook in one sitting from 3 to 6 p.m. As I was close to completing it, my sister mandated me to take a break, so we could feed some stray cats downstairs outside our apartment building. I took many pictures. After that was a brisk walk, observing greeneries and the cloudy sky, and Mulberry trees that belong to my mother. After a shower and blended dinner – due to my current conditions, I was back in my room to finish the last 8 pages of this pocket rulebook at 9.\n\nWas this paragraph written well? Did it contain any unnecessary words or sentences? Like a drawing with no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts?\n\nDid I adhere to the following principles exhorted in the book?\n\n- write in a way that comes naturally\n- revise and rewrite\n- do not explain too much\n- be clear\n\nI am uncertain.\n\nWriting is hard. It's an awkward process of trying to find the right words, and blaming yourself when you can't get the fit the puzzle pieces right, and you wonder if the pieces even belong in the puzzle.\n\nReading this book made me question whether I know English at all. Maybe I learned English from consuming a lot of text and audio input, like an LLM, and I'm regurgitating them out when I'm prompted for an output. Or maybe I internalized the fundamental rules when I was learning English as a kid, and when I apply them they feel second nature. I don't consciously check whether my participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence referred to the grammatical subject, or if I used the proper case of pronoun. If it sounds right in my head, I keep it. If not, I rewrite. That's how I write.\n\nSome notes from the book.\n\n### I: Elementary Rules of Usage.\n\nThis part gave me flashbacks to english classes in high school and college.\n\nSome reminders and takeaways\n\n- The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash\n- A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses\n- who or whom?\n  - if you answer with HE, use who (asking about subject)\n    - He is the candidate who we think will win (we think HE will win)\n  - if you answer with HIM, use whom (asking about object)\n    - \"He is the candidate whom we hope to elect (we hope to elect HIM)\n\n### II: Principles of composition\n\n- Choose a **suitable design** and hold to it\n  - planning must be a deliberate prelude to writing. foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape\n  - most forms of compositions are less clearly defined, more flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer will bring the flesh and the blood. The more clearly the writer perceives the shape, the better the chances of success.\n- Make the **paragraph the unit of composition**\n  - breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a visual help\n  - Moderation and sense of order should be the main consideration in paragraphing\n- Use the **active voice**\n  - ex: \"The reason he left college was that his health became impaired\" -> \"Failing health compelled him to leave college\"\n  - habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing.\n  - brevity is a by-product of vigor\n- Put statements in the **positive form**\n  - Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal language. Use the word _not_ as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.\n  - The reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the reader wishes to be told what is. Hence, it is better to express even a negative in positive\n    - \"not honest\" -> \"dishonest\"\n    - \"not important\" -> \"trifling\"\n    - \"did not pay any attention to\" -> \"ignored\"\n  - Save the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations involving real uncertainty.\n    - can/would -> will\n    - may be among -> was a\n- use **definite, specific, concrete** language\n  - specific > general, definite > vague, concrete > abstract\n  - The greatest writers – Homer, Dante, Shakespeare – are effective largely because they deal in particulars and report the details that matter. Their words call up pictures.\n  - \"a period of unfavorable weather set in\" -> \"it rained every day for a week\"\n- **omit needless words**\n  - he is a man who -> he\n  - this is a subject that -> this subject\n  - _The fact that_ should be revised out of every sentence\n  - Who is, which was, and the like are often superfluous\n- avoid a succession of **loose sentences**\n  - using connectives and, but, who, which, when, where, and while in nonrestrictive senses (extra info in a sentence that can be removed without changing the core meaning of the sentence)\n  - a writer who has written a series of loose sentences should recast them to remove the monotony, replacing them with:\n    - simple sentences\n    - sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon\n    - periodic sentences of two clauses\n    - sentences (loose or periodic) of three clauses\n- Express coordinate ideas in **similar form**\n  - The Beatitudes exemplify the virtue of parallel construction\n    - Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n    - Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n    - Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n    - Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. The unskilled writer of\n- **Keep related words together**\n  - positions of words in a sentence is the principal means of showing their relationship. Confusion and ambiguity result when words are badly placed\n    - \"He noticed a large stain in the rug that was right in the center\" -> \"He noticed a large stain right in the center of the rug\"\n  - modifiers should come next to the words they modify\n    - \"All the members were not present\" vs \"Not all the members were present\"\n- place **emphatic words** of a sentence at the end\n  - \"At the end of the day, tired and weary, we saw the beautiful sunset.\" vs \"Tired and weary, we saw the beautiful sunset at the end of the day.\"\n  - the other prominent position is the beginning: \"Deceit or treachery she could never forgive\"\n\n### IV: Words and Expressions commonly misused\n\n- Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer\n- _To compare to_ is to point out resemblances between different objects; _to compare with_ is to point out differences between similar objects\n- Disinterested means \"impartial\", do not confuse it with uninterested\n- \"combustible\" is inflammable\n- **In terms of**: a piece of padding usually best omitted\n- **Less** should not be misused for fewer, less refers to quantity, fewer to number.\n- **Like** has been long widely misused by the illiterate\n- **One of the most**: avoid this feeble formula\n- **shall** for the first person, **will** for the second and third.\n- **So**. Avoid in writing, the use of so as an intensifier.\n- **That** is defining, **which** is nondefining or adds information\n\n### V: An approach to style\n\nThis was my favorite part of the book. A lot of useful insights that I want to apply and remind myself while I write.\n\nWhat is style?\n\n- Who can confidently say what ignites a certain combination of words, causing them to explode in the mind? Who knows why certain notes in music are capable of stirring the listener deeply, though the same notes slightly rearranged are impotent?\n- There is no satisfactory explanation of style, no infallible guide to good writing, no assurance that a person who thinks clearly will be able to write clearly, no key that unlocks the door, no inflexible rule by which writers may shape their course. Writers will often find themselves steering by stars that are disturbingly in motion\n- Style in an increment in writing. When we speak of Fitzgerald's style, we don't mean his command of the relative pronoun, we mean the sound his words make on paper. All writers, by the way they use the language, reveal something of **their spirits, their habits, their capacities**, and their biases. This is inevitable as well as enjoyable. All writing is communication; creative writing is communication through revelation – it is the **Self escaping into the open**. No writer long remains incognito.\n- Style not only reveals the spirit of the man but **reveals his identity**, as surely as would his fingerprints\n\nStye is not a garnish\n\n- Young writers often suppose that style is a garnish for the meat of prose, a sauce by which a dull dish is made palatable. Style has no such separate entity; it is nondetachable, unfilterable.\n- The beginner should **approach style warily, realizing that it is an expression of self**, and should turn resolutely away from all devices that are popularly believed to indicate style – all mannerisms, tricks, adornments. The approach to style is by way of **plainness, simplicity, orderliness, sincerity**.\n\nWriting is slow\n\n- the mind travels faster than the pen; consequently, writing becomes a question of learning to make occasional wing shots, bringing down the bird of thought as it flashes by.\n- A writer is a gunner, sometimes waiting in the blind for something to come in, sometimes roaming the countryside hoping to scare something up. Like other gunners, the writer must cultivate patience, working many covers to bring down one partridge\n\nA list of suggestions and cautionary hints to help you find the way to a satisfactory style.\n\n- **Place yourself in the background**\n  - write in a way that draws the reader's attention to the sense and substance of the writing, rather than to the mood and temper of the author.\n  - The act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too.\n- Write in a way that comes **naturally**\n  - use words and phrases that come readily to hand\n  - The use of language begins with imitation. Never imitate consciously, but do not worry about being an imitator; take pains instead to admire what is good.\n- Work from a **suitable design**\n  - Designs informs even the simplest structure, whether of brick and steel or of prose.\n  - even the kind of writing that is essentially adventurous and impetuous will on examination be found to have a secret plan. Columbus didn't just sail, he sailed west.\n- Write with **nouns and verbs**\n  - not with adjectives and adverbs, occasionally they surprise us with their power, but it's nouns and verbs, not their assistants that give good writing its toughness and color\n- **Revise and rewrite**\n  - quite often you will discover serious flaws in the arrangement of the material of your work, calling for transposition. This is no sign of weakness or defeat, it is a common occurrence in all writing.\n- Do not **overwrite**\n  - Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, generally unwholesome, and sometimes nauseating.\n  - guard against wordiness, the click and flow of a word processor can be seductive, you may find yourself adding unnecessary words just to experience the pleasure of running your fingers over the keyboard and watching words appear on the screen.\n  - it is always a good idea to reread your writing later and ruthlessly delete the excess\n- Do not **overstate**\n  - overstate and readers will lose confidence in your judgement or your poise\n- Avoid the use of **qualifiers**\n  - rather, very, little, pretty – these are leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of words\n- Do not affect a **breezy manner**\n  - the breezy style is often the work of an egocentric, the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day\n- Use **orthodox spelling**\n  - he reads the form _though_ automatically, without thought of its needless complexity; he reads the abbreviation _tho_ and mentally supplies the missing letters, at teh cost of a fraction of his attention. The writer has defeated his own purpose.\n- do not **explain too much**\n  - be sparing in the use of adverbs: \"he said consolingly,\" \"she replied grumblingly,\" Let the conversation itself disclose the speaker's manner or condition\n- Do not construct **awkward adverbs**\n  - Do not dress words up by adding -ly to them, as though putting a hat on a horse (\"overly\" -> \"over\")\n  - \"tiredly\" -> \"wearily\"\n- make sure the reader knows **who is speaking**\n  - The best test for locating an attributive is to speak the sentence aloud\n- avoid **fancy words**\n  - do not be tempted by a $20 dollar word when there is a ten-center handy, ready and able\n  - A matter of ear, a matter of reading the books that sharpen the ear.\n  - The question of ear is vital. Only the writer whose ear is reliable is in a position to use bad grammar deliberately\n- **Be clear**\n  - since writing is communication, clarity can only be a virtue. And although there is no substitute for merit in writing, clarity comes closest to being one.\n  - Usually what is wrong is that the construction has become too involved at some point; the sentence needs to be broken apart and replaced by two or more shorter sentences\n  - Think of the tragedies rooted in ambiguity, and be clear! When you say something, make sure you have said it.\n- Do not inject **opinion**\n  - unless there is a good reason for its presence, do not insert opinion into a piece of writing. We all have opinions about almost everything, and the temptation to toss them in is great.\n  - Opinions scattered indiscriminately about leave the mark of egotism on a work\n- **Do not take shortcuts** at the cost of clarity\n  - Many shortcuts are self-defeating; they waste the reader's time instead of conserving it\n  - The longest way round is usually the shortest way home. The only true reliable shortcut in writing is to choose words that are strong and surefooted to carry readers on their way\n- **Prefer the standard** to the offbeat\n  - Young writers will be drawn at every turn toward eccentricities in language; the problem for beginners is to listen to them, learn the words, feel the vibrations, and not be carried away.\n  - To use the language well, do not begin by hacking it to bits; accept the whole body of it, cherish its classic form, its variety, and its richness.\n  - \"writing is an act of faith, not a trick of grammar\"\n  - No one can write decently who is distrustful of the reader's intelligence, or whose attitude is patronizing.\n  - Your concern for the reader must be pure: you must sympathize with the reader's plight, but never seek to know the reader's wants.\n  - **Your whole duty as a writer is to please and satisfy yourself, and the true writer always plays to an audience of one**. Start sniffing the air, or glancing at the Trend Machine, and you're as good as dead, although you may make a nice living.\n",

    "content": "\n![Arrival of a Convoy by David Olère](/images/convoy.jpg)\n\nI started this book when I was going through a whirlwind of emotions returning home from the US. I fought hard as an international student for 2 years in the states, with only one goal in mind: to get a job in FAANG and build a life there. I got a taste of it. Two summer internships in the bay where I collected people and experiences. I had a spot waiting for me after graduating. I could see the life I could've had. Instead of 12-weeks counting down before running out of time to complete your projects, the responsibility will be greater, the projects will be harder, and the days will be longer. But the relationships will flourish, new friendships will sprout, and novel experiences will continue to be collected. But I had to choose between my health and my future.\n\nI was halfway through the book sitting at the Gastroenterology branch of the hospital, wondering why I'm the youngest person waiting to get an endoscope done. I felt life was unfair and pondered why all this was happening to me, trying to make sense of the all the suffering (of the mind). I was immersed in the book up to the point where the nurses asked me leave my belongings and wheeled my bed into the room.\n\nI finished reading two weeks later, in the car at a dim parking lot of an old mall waiting for my parents to shop for groceries. The mall where I used to have McDonald's ice cream and sweet potato fries from Nandos, play arcade games, get haircuts, and shop for clothes. A time when I was younger and healthier, and happier, unaware of what's to come in 2021.\n\nNow I'm writing a summary of it after at the end of this month, where half of it was spent visiting 8 doctors across 3 specializations in 8 different hospitals and clinics, still in pain from the 8 teeth extractions I had the day before.\n\nSo that was my January. It was fulfilling in a way that I got to\ntake back control of my life. My diseases determined my every action, and I felt really trapped. It was suffocating. I have free will again.\n\nAside from the tragic and bone-chilling accounts that Dr Frankl shared during his personal experience at the concentration camps, this book helped me make sense of suffering.\n\nBelow are some quotes on suffering I want to capture and internalize from reading this book, in bullet points.\n\n- central theme of existentialism: to life is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.\n- Nietzsche: \"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how\"\n- Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress\n- everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way\n- Dostoevski said once: \"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings\"\n- If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\n- Here lies the chance for a man to either make use of or to forego the opportunities of attaining the values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not\n- Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving something through his own suffering\n- an exceptionally difficult external situation gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself.\n- \"life is like being at the dentist. You always think the worst is still to come, yet it is over already.\"\n- It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future – sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.\n- I kept thinking of endless little problems of our miserable life ... I became disgusted with teh state of affairs which compelled me, daily and hourly, to think of only such trivial things. I forced my thoughts to turn to another subject ... All that oppressed me at that moment became objective, seen and described from a viewpoint of science. By this method I succeeded somehow in rising above the sufferings of the moment. I observed them as if they were already of the past.\n- Spinoza: \"Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\n- \"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life – daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in the right action and conduct. Life ultimately means taking responsibility to find the right answers to its problems and fulfill the tasks which ti constantly sets for each individual.\"\n- \"When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task ... No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.\n- Rilke: \"Wie viel ist aufzuleiden!\" (How much suffering there is to get through!). He spoke of \"getting through suffering\" as others would talk of \"getting through work\". There was plenty of suffering for us to get through. Therefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering.\n- tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.\n- To talk people out of suicide: \"it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from then; something in the future was expected of them.\n- The uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much it does on human love.\n- A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears towards a human being who affectionately waits for him or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.\n- whatever we had gone through could still be an asset to us in the future. Nietzsche: \"Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker.\" (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.)\n- \"Was Du erlebt, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben\" (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you) ... Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind.\n- Human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have a meaning, and that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, privation and death.\n- Someone looks down on each of us in difficult hours – a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God – and would hope to find us suffering proudly – not miserably – knowing how to die\n- will to meaning\n  - the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man. In contrast to the will to pleasure (Freudian psychoanalysis) and will to power (Adlerian psychology)\n  - meaning is not self-expression or projection, it is not only an emergence from existence itself, but something confronting existence. Meaning is not invented by ourselves, rather detected.\n  - Values do not drive a man, they do not push him, but rather pull him\n  - Man is never driven to moral behaviour; in each instance he decides to behave morally ... he does not do it to have a good conscience; he does so for the sake of a cause to which he commits to himself, or for a person who he loves, or for the sake of his God. If he did it for the sake of a good conscience, he would have become a Pharisee and cease to be a truly moral person.\n- suffering is an achievement\n  - not every conflict is necessarily neurotic, some amount of conflict is normal and healthy. Suffering is not always a pathological phenomenon, rather than being a symptom of neurosis, suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if it grows out of existential frustration. A man's concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is a spiritual distress but by no means a mental disease.\n  - man's search for meaning and values may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. However, precisely this tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health.\n  - mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish\n  - What man needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him.\n- existential vacuum\n  - no instincts tells him what he has to do; and no tradition tells him what he oughts to do; sometimes he doesn't even know what he wishes to do.\n  - Instead he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism)\n  - manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom\n  - Schopenhauer: Mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between two extremes of distress and boredom\n  - boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than is distress\n  - \"Sunday neurosis\" the kind of depression that afflicts people who become aware of the lack of contentment in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves manifest.\n- Meaning of life\n  - there is no best move in chess, same holds for human existence, one should not search for an abstract meaning of life.\n  - everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment\n  - man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked\n  - each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\n- essence of existence\n  - \"So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\"\n  - such a precept confronts him with life's finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.\n  - man must actualize the potential meaning of his life. true meaning of life is to be found in the world rather than within man\n  - human existence is essentially self-transcendence rather than self-actualization. Self actualization is not a possible aim at all, the more a man would strive for it, the more he would miss it. self actualization is a side effect of self-transcendence.\n- 3 ways to discover meaning\n  - (1) doing a deed\n    - by way of achievement or accomplishment\n  - (2) experiencing a value\n    - experience something, work of nature or culture, and by experiencing someone i.e. Love\n    - Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality\n    - no one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.\n    - By the spiritual act of love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, that which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.\n  - (3) by suffering\n    - \"whenever one is confronted with an inescapable, unavoidable situation, whenever one has to face a fate that cannot be changed, then is one given a last change to actualize the highest value, to fulfill the deepest meaning, the meaning of suffering.\n    - what matters above all is the attitude we take toward suffering, the attitude in which we take our suffering upon ourselves.\n    - Suffering ceases to be suffering in some way at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.\n    - Traditional psychotherapy aims to restore one's capacity to work and to enjoy life, logotherapy includes these, and goes further to have the patient regain the ability to suffer, if need be, thereby finding meaning even in suffering\n    - our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy\n    - the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading. \"he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy\"\n    - What never can be ruled out in life is the unavoidability of suffering. In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end. In other words, life's meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes the potential meaning of suffering.\n    - \"Has all this suffering, this dying around us, a meaning?\"\n",

Although I did started to have anxiety the night before and the day of.\n\nI've been wanting braces since high school and this is a big step towards having a nice smile. I never smiled in pictures and when talking to people, and it sucks. I'm always self-conscious about it. I just want to smile. But a certain programming in my brain, either self-written or installed from the society's standards of beauty makes it really hard.\n\nSo I'm glad I got to do this today. I felt really blessed to have the chance to fix my teeth. 4 of my wisdom teeth were taken out and the other 4 were for braces.\n\nThe doctor I visited was Dr Wong Foot Meow. He's an Oral and maxillofacial surgeon that's on the National specialist register and has won awards. So I was in good hands.\n\nUpon arrival I could feel myself feeling a little tense and jittery, fearful yet curious.\n\nI sat down in the chair and after he got my confirmation about the entire operation, he injected the IV sedation (my second one this month). I could feel the spiciness of the liquid travel into through my bloodstream. I immediately felt calm and light headed. I asked if 8 teeth is ok and he answered with no hesitation, a confident and strong \"of course, it's nothing big\".\n\nI was asked to bite a black block with a strip for my left teeth, and everything began really quickly. As I entered into a \"twilight\" state between waking and sleeping consciousness, I started to feel sharp injections into my gum, but I felt minimal pain.\n\nThen it was a lot of drilling sounds, some pulling and shaking, I could slightly hear the detachment of my teeth, but I felt nothing. Thank God for anesthetics.\n\nAbout an hour later, I could feel phantom shaking and pulling, like my brain stored the memory of the actions and the effects only showed up later once I was conscious, it was pretty trippy.\n\nThe pulse oximeter on my left finger orchestrated the irregular beeping sound on a machine displaying a number oscillating around 99, producing a syncopation effect that I've heard before in songs and in jazz.\n\nIn this state, I remember I couldn't hold on to a single thought. Every thought was ephemeral and fleeting. I could see SIDEXIS NEXT GENERATION on the screen in front of me. It looks like a software that this clinic uses to manage patients.\n\nI remember feeling good at this moment. I felt no pain. I was weirdly happy. It was the drugs.\n\nAround 2 p.m., I was asked to sit outside the waiting room to receive my medication. I got a blue liquid (to sit in my mouth and NEVER RINSE), two antibiotics, a painkiller, and some sleeping pills.\n\nI reached home and started watching Kiki's Delivery Service. It was great at distracting myself from the pain. Jiji is adorable. I want a black cat with his personality. At this point the anesthetics were wearing off and the pain really started to kick in. I was bleeding a lot from 8 holes in my mouth. My mouth was firing pain signals that my brain could no longer ignore. My gums were being torn apart on a microscopic level and they were on fire. It was agonizing. Around 5 p.m. my pain was excruciating. I was squeezing on a pillow, clenching my fist, telling myself I can hold on just a little longer before taking pain killers.\n\nI eventually cave, paused Kiki with 10 minutes left, and went to kill the pain. I also ate some tofu pudding at this point. The pain killers were so effective and I stopped feeling pain about 40 minutes after. I could function again.\n\nAfter Kiki I watched some of Porco Rosso. The action was fun. I'm very curious how this man turned into a pig.\n\nI ate more tofu pudding with my family at dinner time. After that I went back to do some work.\n\nIt's now 11:16 p.m. and I don't remember what I was doing the past 3 hours.\n\nI hope I can sleep tonight. I just took another painkiller and I'm waiting for the effects to kick in.\n\nI was thinking how there's no way I can give up now. My dad is supporting me financially in all of this.\n\nI have braces scheduled two weeks after, and fundoplication surger another two weeks after that. The first half of this year will be about healing and recovery, and the rest will be full of possibilities and growth. I'm optimistic.\n",

([The Substance of Style](http://books.google.com/books?id=MqdydvbWZgEC))\n- **divide and conquer**: cut big, hard problems into small pieces.\n- **throw things away**: it's not code that is valuable, but the understanding you've gain from building it. don't be afraid to throw something away to do it again, it will almost always be faster to build and much better the second (or nth) time around.\n- **Machate design**: create a single, general-purpose tool that is simple to understand but can be applied to many problems. product version of occam's razor. (create iPhones, not TV remotes)\n- **small sharp tools**: composability. simple tolls that do one thing well can be composed with other tools to create a nearly infinite number of results.\n- **Do-ocracy / interapreneur**: ask forgiveness, not permission. take the initiative to make something happen and take responsibility for failures\n- **Everything is an experiment**: anything is always subject to change. ending an experiment isn't a failure, you learn the most from experiments that don't produce expected results\n- **gradual rollouts**: easy into everything. use feature flags to activate people slowly into changes. test internally -> private beta -> public\n- **design everything**: [Less is More](https://books.google.com.my/books?id=TL1aywAACAAJ&redir_esc=y) & [The Design of Everyday Things](http://books.google.com/books?id=w8pM72p_dpoC)\n- **do less**: can we delete that code? do you need that feature? can you outsource the work to a partner/company so you don't have to build or maintain that?\n- **question everything**: status quo is never good enough\n- **interfaces matter**: everything has an interface (platforms have APIs, teams need to file issues and collaborate) good interfaces are narrow and well-defined\n- **names matter**: think carefully about how something is named. pick exactly one name for each concept the user needs to track and stick to it. Write a glossary to design vocabulary around something.\n- **ignore the competition**: except to borrow good ideas.\n- **write well**: clear writing is clear thinking\n- **strong opinions, weakly held**: have a strong opinion and argue passionately for it. but when you encounter new information, be willing to change your mind.\n- **candor**: be blunt, honest, and truthful. constructive criticism is the best kind. don't keep quite for the sake of politeness.\n- **programming literacy for all**: everyone can and should be able to write software\n",

    "content": "\n![Three Musicians, 1921 by Pablo Picasso](/images/musicians.jpg)\n\nI was wondering today about why and how music can influence my emotions a lot.\n\nI could be in a neutral state. But once I listen to songs that are sad/happy/relaxing/exciting, I unconsciously mimic those emotions. Some subtle like transpiration of water through a plant from the roots to the leaves, others like an ice cold shower or an electric shock to my brain. It happens so automatically that I find it very alarming, intriguing, and practical.\n\nSo I did a search and started reading this wikipedia page: [Music and Emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_emotion).\n\nHere are some things interesting insights.\n\n- music is good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood (motherly singing as a way to relay emotional messages), may play a role in [identify formation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10298649020050S103)\n- children at age of 4 are able to distinguish emotions in music in ways similar to adults\n- People high in agreeableness have higher emotional responses to music in general\n  - Stronger sad feelings have been associated with people high in agreeableness and neuroticism\n- previous exposure to music [can affect](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/124/5/1488/72119/Impact-of-Music-Music-Lyrics-and-Music-Videos-on?autologincheck=redirected) later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions\n- why people listen to sad music?\n  - to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [cognitive reappraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reappraisal), to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement\n- familiarity with a piece of music [increases](https://doi.org/10.1525%2FMP.2010.27.3.177) the emotions experienced by the listener\n- Emotional memories & actions\n  - Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.\n  - Music is processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it **impervious to later memory distortions**\n  - Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight\n  - many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed\n- In Juslin and Västfjäll's [BRECVEM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_emotion?useskin=vector#Juslin_and_V%C3%A4stfj%C3%A4ll's_BRECVEM_model).\n  - **evaluative conditioning**: a piece of music paired repeatedly with a positive or negative stimuli\n    - ex: playing a piece of music every time you meet your best friend. This music can evoke happiness even in the absence of the interaction.\n  - **emotional contagion**: a listener perceives the emotional expression in a song, then 'mimics' the expression internally, inducing the same emotion.\n  - **visual imagery**: listener conjures up visual images while listening to music (a beautiful landscape)\n  - **episodic memory**: music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. Referred to as \"Darling , they're playing our tune\" phenomenon.\n\nAfter discovering this, I find [music psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_psychology?useskin=vector) and [music therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy) to be super interesting. I want to talk to people who are in this field.\n\nAdding the following books to my reading list:\n\n- [This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Levitin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141565.This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Music)\n- [Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain by Oliver Sacks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1297985.Musicophilia)\n- [Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy: How Music Captures Our Imagination by Robert Jourdain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141566.Music_The_Brain_And_Ecstasy)\n\nIf you want to go even deeper into this topic, read books by Barbara and Bruscia.\n",

Porter and Forest L. Reinhardt\n\nI came across the company [Watershed](https://watershed.com/) on LinkedIn last year while I was in Cali. I want to work in the climate tech space, so this company peaked my curiosity.\n\nI have ~7 months (-1 for surgery recovery) in Malaysia if things go well with grad school (still no interviews btw I'm freaking out). I googled for climate tech companies in Malaysia and [Pantas](https://pantas.com/) was the first result.\n\nI reached out to people working in that company, and chatted with a senior DS working there currently.\n\nTo prepare for the chat, I did a quick one hour research into carbon emission tracking.\n\nFirst, there's the formula to calculate carbon emissions.\n\n```txt\n\"activity or energy consumption\" data X emission factor\n```\n\nThis value is in CO2e – carbon dioxide equivalent.\n\nThe emission factor is the challenge here. They're usually just broad approximations, and sometimes you don't have it. Let's say you have a pencil and a pen, you have the emission factor for a broad category - stationary, but nothing more specific.\n\nYou have a way to measure it. But how wide do you collect and measure? Emissions can be direct and indirect. There are also upstream and downstream activities that have GHG impact.\n\nSince 1998, the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards_supporting/FAQ.pdf) (GHG protocol), developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Sustainable The Business Council for Development (WBCSD), has developed greenhouse gas emissions accounting standards.\n\nWhy is this necessary?\n\n- it can facilitate description of direct and indirect emission sources\n- improves transparency\n- serves different types of institution and different types of climate policies and business goals\n\nThere are 3 scopes of carbon emissions as defined in the protocol.\n\nScope 1 & 2 are mandatory, while #3 is voluntary and hardest to monitor.\n\n## Scope 1: direct emissions\n\n- emission from company-owned and controlled resources\n- categories:\n  - stationary combustion: fuels, heating sources\n  - mobile combustion: cars, vans, trucks\n  - fugitive emissions: leaks from ghg (refrigeration, ac units)\n  - process emissions: released during industrial processes, on-site manufacturing\n\n## Scope 2: indirect emissions\n\n- indirect emissions from generation of purchased energy from utility provider, including electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed\n\n## Scope 3: indirect emissions - not owned\n\n- all indirect emissions not in scope 2, occurring in the value chain of reporting company\n- 15 categories in total\n  - upstream\n    - business travel\n    - employee commuting\n    - waste generated in operations (landfills, wastewater treatments)\n    - purchased goods and services (production-related & non-prod related)\n    - transportation and distribution\n    - fuel and energy-related activities (production of fuels and energy not included in #1 and #2)\n    - capital goods (buildings, vehicles, machinery)\n  - downstream\n    - investments (equity, debt, project finance, managed investments, client services)\n    - franchises (operations under franchisee control)\n    - leased assets (upstream and downstream leasing)\n    - use of sold products (\"in-use\" emissions from sold products)\n    - end-of-life treatment. (disposal of products sold to consumers)\n\nBelow is Apple's 3 scopes visualized.\n\n![Apple Carbon Footprint](/images/apple_carbon.png)\n\nNotice how scope #3 represents the largest portion of a company's GHG impact.\n\nBy tracking all 3 scopes, companies can understand their full value chain emissions and focus their efforts on the greatest GHG reduction opportunities\n",

In our response lies our growth and our happiness.\n\nThings didn't go your way. Life happens. You're stressed.\n\nYou cannot control these external events, but there lies a space between stimulus and response, an opportunity to choose how you react to negative triggers and regulate your emotions\n\nThere are 3 steps.\n\n## 1. Identify the emotion\n\nThe first step is to pinpoint the exact emotional state you're in and remind yourself that this is just a state.\n\nEmotions are just patterns in our body (rate of breathing, blood flow), and with [interoceptive awareness](https://nesslabs.com/interoception), we can gain control over these emotions\n\nThere are five main categories of negative emotions\n\n1. Anxiety: worry, fear, nervosity, panic, etc.\n1. Anger: irritation, frustration, rage, etc.\n1. Guilt: culpability, remorse, etc.\n1. Sadness: despair, hopelessness, etc.\n1. Shame: embarrassment, humiliation, etc.\n\nFind the closest word to describe how you feel.\n\n## 2. analyze the emotional trigger\n\nTake time to go deeper and understand the underlying mechanics that connect the trigger to the negative emotion.\n\nBe honest with yourself. What are the things you feel you are not getting. What need isn't met?\n\nBelow is a list of the most common unmet needs by Dr. Marcia Reynolds:\n\n1. Acceptance\n1. Attention\n1. Autonomy\n1. Balance\n1. Being in control\n1. Being liked\n1. Being needed\n1. Being right\n1. Being treated fairly\n1. Being understood\n1. Being valued\n1. Comfort\n1. Consistency\n1. Feel included\n1. Freedom\n1. Fun\n1. Independence\n1. Love\n1. New challenges\n1. Order\n1. Peacefulness\n1. Predictability\n1. Respect\n1. Safety\n\nChoose three unmet needs from this list.\n\nWhen combined together, they form an equation which results in your negative emotional trigger.\n\nEx: deadline was moved up without checking with you\n\n> trigger = lack of consistency + respect + feeling included\n\nCome up with your equation.\n\n## 3. shift your emotional state\n\nNow that you know your emotional state, and analyzed the trigger, it's time to shift.\n\nChoose to feel something different.\n\nYou can try these exercises to change your mood\n\n1. walking meditation: find a quiet place to walk slowly while letting go of the emotions attached to the trigger. focus on the sensations of standing and the movements that keep your balance\n2. conscious breathing: breath to relax your body and mind. focus on one word which represents how you want to feel.\n3. practice gratitude: think about three things you're grateful for\n\nThere are many other exercises.\n\nThe main thing is the belief that even though you're not in control of these situations, **you can regulate your emotions**.\n",

There is heat in freezing, be a testament.\n\nI watched this video by Tanya Davis on [How To Be Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7X7sZzSXYs)\n\nIt's been almost 3 weeks since I came back home to Malaysia.\n\nA big part of my identity is tied to the US, I close my eyes and I'm back in my apartment, back in the library where I used to take breaks and read design books, where I would take walks daily and watch sunsets. When I was in Cali, I could create plans in the weekends with my friends to explore a new spot. I could go to meetups and hackathons and talk to startups founders.\n\nI miss it a lot still. Or I miss the people. I found it hard at times to not be with my friends anymore. I felt like my body was here but my heart wasn't. Like I was missing a big piece of myself. These overwhelming emotions morphs from sadness into anger, and into grief and regret. I get stuck in thought loops that I can't seem to get out of. I often have deep cravings and bursts of longing for social interaction, to be able to see them face to face, to feel their eyes locked on mine, to hear their voice and their laughter, to be there and notice when they get frustrated, when they get anxious, when they're happy. But I realize that it's not possible anymore.\n\nI used to be fine with being alone. I actually enjoyed it during lockdown in 2020. But after spending time with friends in the US, it made it hard to be alone. I never realized how much close friendships could change my internal makeup, how much they could inspire me, influence me, and help me be more selfless. I'm constantly in my head, and they help me drag me out of that space, and into theirs, and it reminds me that most of my pain isn't real, that there is more to life than this, and that there is beauty in everything. Some friendships are addicting, they make you more playful and you're excited to see them. Life becomes more colorful.\n\nI spent the past two days at home. I have no job and no school. I live with my family, whom I do love a lot, but I feel alone, in the sense that they don't understand me. They're different from me in a lot of ways and sometimes talking to them feels very strained and stranger-like. But they're very accepting and loving, which is really all you need from your family. I asked for a room for myself with a wall full of art and plants and a cat, and now I have the former, the latter is still in debates. I'm writing this in my new room with (almost) everything set up. I was complaining a lot about the noise and the humidity and how I didn't have my own space. I have it now. Now it's time to focus on my work. I have a lot of work to accomplish. They're mostly my writing work, preparations for potential grad school interviews, side projects, learning swift, and upskilling in AI and ML so I can be an AI engineer earning 500k USD one day. I still get bouts of longing and sadness which is pretty distracting, and a lot of dread and bitterness with my health issues, but I get by with YouTube streaming and bouncy and loud Korean songs, biking 7.77 miles on the stationary bike everyday ~6pm, posting on Twitter, and the friends who I still chat with through text.\n\nI'm sure things will get better, I'm still adjusting to change, and accepting it. I have to actively remind myself to reject cynicism and remain optimistic.\n",

Frankl, he describes the conditions of the prisoners minds in the camps and the context of this quote.\n\nIn each suffering lies two choices: to either **embrace suffering with dignity, bravery and moral perseverance**, or to decay, in his fight for self preservation, into an animal. This determines whether or not a man is worth of his suffering. The suffering of the greatest kind is the suffering where humans are depraved of all choices and yet, the last of human freedom is the choice of how we deal with our suffering.\n\nThere's also the stoics view, who believed a true sage was someone worthy of all challenges the gods sent their way.\n\n> Show me one who is sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him me. By the gods I would fain see a Stoic. Nay you cannot show me a finished Stoic; then show me one in the moulding, one who has set his feet on the path.” – Epicetus\n\nThere would be no Hercules without all the trials and tribulations he went through. He was worthy of the challenges he faced, and that's why we remember Hercules today.\n\nSo the question isn't whether you will or will not suffer. Existence is suffering.\n\nThe question is: how will you act in the face of suffering?\n",

I hate that I have to do it.\n\nI needed some form of comfort. A coping mechanism. I decided to bring Man's Search for Meaning along with me. Scrolling on my phone wouldn't cut it. I didn't want a distraction. I wanted powerful words. Words that can help me make sense of all these emotions.\n\nI read in the car while my sister drove my mom and I to Pantai Hospital, which translates to beach hospital in English. It's kinda funny. This is my vacation while I'm back. Hospitals.\n\nIt's my second time back after an initial consultation. I arrived at 9 a.m., but had to wait till 10:30 a.m. to be called into my patient bed to get changed and prepped for my procedure.\n\nWhile waiting, I read Dr. Frankl's words on suffering. By no means did I suffer even the slightest amount of pain and turmoil the prisoners went through in concentration camps. However, he wrote before that suffering has no size, great or small, it is still suffering.\n\nI was convinced to think of suffering differently, a new mindset, a new perspective. Suffering is an opportunity, a value that can be attainted if I look hard enough. A chance to meet my great fate, to reach spiritual heights that I would not otherwise. To not seek meaning in life, but to think about what life expects of me. To accept suffering as a life's task. And when I feel like giving up, to remind myself of the love of friends and family, and God, who expects me to keep hanging on. I had to remind myself of the \"why\", so that I can bear any \"how\". And that what doesn't kill me will only make me stronger. Because suffering is meaning and meaning is suffering, and life will never cease to have meaning. Reading these words help quiet down the storm in my heart. I kept seeing these issues in my life as a bad hand in the genetic lottery, as a statistics. I saw myself as unlucky, unworthy of my suffering. But reading all these words help me form a clear and precise picture my emotion, which is suffering, and it ceased to be suffering.\n\nI went in and sat on the hospital beds. I was asked to confirm my date of birth and last meal by many nurses on many accounts. I suppose you can't be too safe, you wouldn't want to operate on the wrong person.\n\nMy veins weren't showing well, so the intravenous cannula (IV) insertions had some hiccups. They first did it on my right hand, but it resulted in a blood clot, or in medical lingo, a superficial thrombophlebitis.\n\nThe three nurses came to look at my IV. Are these nurses even trained?\n\nI observed who my friends were in the open space. The patients were at least in their 40s. One was definitely in his 70s. I couldn't understand it. Why is this happening to me. I found it funny. I couldn't help but laugh. This is the life that I have to accept.\n\nAs I was laying in bed staring at the ceiling, I just kept thanking God and my family. And said prayers for the procedure to go well. And that I won't wakeup halfway to a doctor sticking a tube down my throat.\n\nAs I got rolled into the endoscopy room, those tv/movie scenes with people being rolled to the ER comes to mind. Luckily for me, I'm not going into ER.\n\nIn the room, I see nurses and doctors busy getting ready setting up the equipments and tools. Dr W, the gastroenterologist from my initial consultation was checking her phone.\n\nEverything happened really fast. It's like dancers getting ready for their performance.\n\nI was strapped on a blood pressure monitor on my arm, and a small one for my finger. The doctor in charge of my anesthetic stuck another IV down into my left arm, and it stung, a lot. I could feel my arm burning when he injected propofol. A nurse sprayed some numbing agent into my throat and asked me to swallow it. Before my brain could register the taste of it, I was asked to bite on a device that could keep my mouth open for the tube to enter. Then I was asked to roll my body to my left. Soon after, the lights went out.\n\nNext thing I knew, I was outside in the patient rooms. I slept like a baby. It was the best sleep I've had since I could remember, maybe since I had GERD. I wonder why that is.\n\nBoth my hands were hurting a lot. I was given a sandwich with white bread wrapping tomato tuna and a thin spread of egg. I told them I couldn't drink Milo, it is cocoa which has caffeine. Do they even know I have GERD?\n\nI ate my breakfast, and was feeling an unusual high. I was abnormally positive. It had to be a side effect of the drug, which I later found celebrities misuse. I was on Twitter a lot.\n\nAfter a while, it was time to get the results.\n\nI met up with my mom again, who's been waiting the entire time.\n\nI got to meet Dr W after waiting 30 more minutes. Her conclusion was that the hernia was still there, but the inflammation is less severe than a year ago. I wonder what I did differently. I might've been a lot less stressed out this past semester. I got to live a slower and peaceful life. And a lot of good things (some bad things too) happened.\n\nI can never understand why she gave me more medication. And I just took it without question.\n\nShe seemed to be hesitant about me getting surgery, but never explicitly voiced out the concern. I don't think she knows how much I want this surgery. It's taken 3 years of my life away. 3 years is a lot in my 20s. Time seems valuable at my age now. I feel like I have to be at my very best at this time, physically and mentally. Now I have a chance to take it back. I wasn't going to give in. This is why I came back for. Why I gave up my california dream. That doesn't mean I'm not afraid. I'm terrified. What if it's too early for surgery? What if I'm being too greedy? What if I'm pulling the lever too early? Instead of exploring more, I'm exploiting too early? Is this God's timing? There's a lot to think about. But I'm glad I'm not alone in this.\n",

So I spend a lot of time trying to understand things.\n\nBut how does one get better at understanding things? Is there a secret hack? Does the practice of trying to understand things well lead to the ability to think well? And what does it mean to understand something well?\n\nTo me, understanding something well means being able to reproduce the idea through speech (explaining to a 5 year old) or craft (coding from scratch) in a simpler, concise manner, like compression, ideally lossless so that you're not straying too far away from the original idea.\n\nKasra has more comprehensive and actionable ideas on [how to think well and understand things](https://bitsofwonder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-well-and-understand), and here's my takeaway on it.\n\n## pay attention\n\npay attention to when you do or don't understand something\n\n- your goal is to get from point A (material is inscrutable) to point B (material is totally intelligible)\n- break things down into manageable pieces and understand those first\n  - make a list of all the words you don't understand and look them up\n  - keep asking yourself: **What are the things I do and don’t understand? At what point in the chain of reasoning did I get lost? What do I need to figure out next to make progress?**\n- What does it mean to understand something?\n  - something to do with your mind entering an isomorphic state to the mind of someone else who does understand it.\n- how do you know you achieved this?\n  - Seek feedback in as many forms as possible.\n  - Play around with the idea, re-explain it to yourself, ask yourself why the concept or theory is in this particular shape rather than another shape.\n  - What are the implications of the theory? What does it leave unresolved?\n  - Share all of these thoughts with others and see whether it makes sense to them.\n\n## Understand the history\n\n- divide the space of things you're trying to learn into **what** and the **why**\n  - what: content of our models and theories\n  - why: why this conclusion? answer lies in a history of experiments, proposals, and disagreements\n- **Reproduce the trail**: write out your own proof for the theorem, implement your own version of the algorithm, design your own hypothetical experiment.\n- **Building intuition**: When you know the trail of experiments and arguments that led us here, you start to build an intuition for how to solve future problems.\n\n## flexibility > correctness\n\n- for big questions with no answers, have the mental flexibility to “take on” different perspectives and see the merits and flaws of each.\n- constantly expose ourselves to different schools of thought and attempt to understand them even when we think they’re probably wrong.\n\n## don't cling on to a singular Truth\n\n> If understanding is contorting your mind to be isomorphic to someone else’s, the holy grail is to be able to contort quickly between various frames of thinking, to see how something that seems absurd on its face might actually be the next world-changing insight.\n",

It has a nameless quality beyond satisfying desires for information and pleasure\n- Reading is nearly solitary. At the beginning you are alone with just the characters. By the end, you are alone with just the author\n- Reading is letting someone else model the world for you.\n- And after finishing a very good book one is driven a little mad, forced to return from a world that no one nearby has witnessed.\n\n### Read for the stories\n\n- The goal is not to digest information, but to **layer over your reality with a fresh coat of moss**. Your own world becomes colored by these stories, so it is worthwhile to spend time seeking the excellent works from across cultures and history.\n- A person who reads no great stories will be influenced by the few stories he does come across in life, for better or worse — and I think mostly worse.\n- a life that is sown with stories is one better positioned to **think and dream**.\n- He who has no poetry in himself will find poetry in nothing. A person that reads no stories is unready for life. A person that reads many stories will be open to yet more stories.\n\n### Read more fiction\n\n- But I think what is most valuable to read are the category of works that resist summary, and the commonplace nonfiction books rarely fulfill that.\n- on fondness for non-fiction: I think this arises from a belief that superior knowledge of the world comes from non-fiction. This thought is attractive to people who build systems, but **over-systematizing and seeing systems in everything can be a failure mode**.\n- Careful descriptions and summaries miss too much of the world. Hard distinctions make bad philosophy\n- Reading fiction helps you become an **unsystematic thinker**, something that is equally valuable but more elided by some engineers. It is easy to maintain an intellectual rigidity. It takes more care to maintain **a loose poeticism of thought**.\n",

    "content": "\n![Melancholy, Edgar Degas](/images/melancholy.jpeg)\n\n[Defense mechanisms](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/defense-mechanisms) are unconscious psychological responses that protect individuals from anxiety, threats to self-esteem, and things they don't want to think about or deal with.\n\nIt was first described by Freud in his psychoanalytic theory.\n\nWhile defense mechanisms are often thought of as negative reactions, they can be adaptive and allow us to function normally, like using humor to get through a stressful situation.\n\nThey become harmful when they prevent us from confronting and dealing with issues, leading to an unresolved problem and contributing to unhealthy patterns of behaviour.\n\nIt's important to develop self-awareness and recognize when we are using them. Therapy helps to understand your defense mechanisms and learn healthier coping strategies. Always confront and process emotions and situations we are defending against, rather than avoiding them.\n\nBelow is a list of common defense mechanisms.\n\n1. **Denial**: \"I've been smoking for years and I'm perfectly fine.\"\n2. **Repression**: A person who had a traumatic experience in their childhood can't remember anything about the event.\n3. **Projection**: A person who is often dishonest suspects others are always lying to them.\n4. **Displacement**: \"He couldn't yell at his boss, so he came home and kicked the dog.\"\n5. **Regression**: A grown adult throwing a tantrum if they don't get their way like a child\n6. **Rationalization**: A student who gets a poor grade claims the teacher doesn't like them, rather than acknowledging they didn't study enough\n7. **Sublimation**: A person with aggressive tendencies becomes a professional boxer to express their aggression in a socially acceptable manner.\n8. **Reaction formation**: A person who is secretly attracted to a coworker constantly talks about how much they dislike them.\n9. **Intellectualization**: After a breakup, a person spends time researching psychological process of grief rather than allowing themselves to feel the pain and sadness\n10. **Avoidance**: A person who is afraid of heights takes a longer route to avoid crossing a high bridge\n11. **Acting Out**: When a person can't express their feelings verbally, they might act out their emotions.\n12. **Compartmentalization**: separating different aspects of life so that failure in one area doesn't affect self-esteem in another, \"I may have failed as a spouse, but at least I'm a good parent\"\n13. **Undoing**: 'undo' an unhealthy thought or behavior by engaging in a contrasting behavior, being overly nice to someone to compensate for thinking something mean\n14. **Suppression**: consciously pushing distressing thoughts to the back of the mind\n15. **Identification**: unconsciously adopting the characteristics of a more powerful person in order to feel less vulnerable, the bullied becoming the bully\n",

I agree that chronic stress is an issue, but I always believed that the right amounts of stress can be good.\n\nRecently I discovered that the mindset towards stress is important as well from the [Huberman lab podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset), specifically the episode on applying growth mindset.\n\nHe cites a study: [Rethinking stress: The role of mindsets in determining the stress response](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-06053-001), where they basically had two groups of participants watch two distinct clips biased towards the nature of stress in 2 ways (stress is good vs stress is bad)\n\nThe tl;dr of the study:\n\n> Stress is bad -> Stress is debilitating.  \n> Stress is good -> <mark>Stress is enhancing</mark> .\n\nThe did multiple experiments, and one of them was testing on work performance, on soft tasks and hard tasks.\n\nThe takeaway is the people who learned that **stress is enhancing** significantly **improved their performance** on hard tasks, and the group who learned that stress is bad had no improvements at all.\n\nKeep in mind there were no additional practice, no drills to do, all that happened was they heard a tutorial that stress is enhancing.\n\nMindset matters.\n\nMore specifically, our cognitive appraisal (a fancy word for understanding) about stress matters: increased cortisol levels, elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus, and shifting of blood away from the periphery, etc.\n\nAll of these are characteristics features of a stress response, we've learned that these are mechanisms put into us to get away from lions.\n\nThe reality is that the stress response is there for a lot of reasons. It is inherent to us and other species as a way to **mobilize us** either away from things or towards them. We need the stress response to engage in **adaptive challenges**.\n\nSo the takeaway is to internalize that the **stress response is neither good or bad**, it depends on whether or not you believe the sensations you're experiencing are serving to enhance your performance or diminish your performance.\n\nAnd **Just learning that it can enhance your performance, can enhance performance.**\n",

    "content": "\nToday, I visited the third specialist for my condition.\n\nThe prior two specialists validated my condition. I did two endoscopes. The first one didn't catch anything, it only confirmed I had GERD. The second showed something more, it gave me more information to work with. It said I have a hiatal hernia Hill III.\n\nI was generating questions in the car with ChatGPT on my iPhone. So that I'm utilizing every second I have with him for the consultation, which later on I discovered costs RM 250 for just 15 min of his time.\n\nBeing in a hospital again feels familiar now, when I was growing up I remember joking and being glad that I never had any serious health issues that required me to admit to hospitals. Oh how I wish that could still be true.\n\nAfter taking the measurements for my health records, I was asked to wait for the doctor outside. A nurse then said that he was to perform a scope, so I had to wait 45 minutes more.\n\nI went out to the courtyard to catch a breath. I forget Malaysia's weather was humid, I miss the weather in the US.\n\nI joked to my mom, people come back from overseas to travel, eat good food, and see old friends. My first visit was to a hospital, to see a new doctor, but the bright side is I did get to eat good food after that.\n\nI was pacing myself around the courtyard, my thoughts mind kept oscillating between fear and gratitude, and I find myself internalizing the words \"it's going to be okay Ben, be grateful that you even get the chance to fix this, that your dad can pay for this, imagine if you were poor and you had this disease, that's even more unfortunate, stop comparing unhealthy you and healthy others.\" I also took some photos because it was a nice courtyard, with a koi fish pond.\n\nIt was time to see the doctor.\n\nI sat down in his room, with my mom and sister with me. He asks \"so what's wrong?\". I ask if can I use English, and begin my story.\n\nHis immediate reaction was, \"Oh so you were the one who messaged me? Wow, so young...\", his eyebrows slightly furrowed and his eyes softened with sympathy.\n\nHe starts the lecture on what GERD is and why reflux happens which I've heard a billion times, I don't understand why they would assume I don't already know this given I've suffered with this for 3 years. But I suppose it's standard practice to explain things.\n\nHe asked me what were the events that led to the first symptoms. I mention home workouts. I ask if this is genetic, I want someone, something to blame for this condition. I want a reason behind all this. He says, some people are naturally thin, and if you work out (especially with bad form), you risk stressing your muscles too much. I ask again if this is genetical, I forget his answer. There's no point knowing. I only want to know if I can be cured.\n\nHe talks about the surgery. My mom asks for the cost. He says ballpark range of RM 35k. My mom mentions I have no insurance. The doctor, surprised, asks why, she replied overseas studies. My dad thought he could save money.\n\nThere are different forms for the surgery, 180 or 360 degree wrap, and it can go different directions. He mentions a 360 might mean you won't be able to belch or vomit easily, or at all, where as a 180 has less side effects, but possible less effective at treating it. He mentions this has a good 10 year cure to it, after that, he's not sure.\n\nThere's too many variables here, I can't deal with uncertainties like this. I need data. I should dive into the research for this operation.\n\nBut he mentions surgery means I get to eat like how I used to, and as much as I want. I won't be thin anymore. That gave me some hope. A glimmer into what my life can be if everything goes well.\n\nI ask if I can work out again. If I can build my muscles like all my friends did back in ISU. I envied their ability to just stress their body out, and instead of getting GERD, they get healthy, strong, ripped bodies that they get to flaunt around, and enjoy social and practical benefits of it.\n\nI ask blatantly if there are other doctors I can get a second opinion on.\n\nThis is scary. What if surgery doesn't fully cure me? What if I go back to the US, and it comes back? What if I never get my life back?\n\nAfter consultation my sister brought us to Arkadia for Hakka food. I forgot how KL has a lot of good chinese food. I no longer have to think about food and that's such a blessing. It's all paid for by my dad. I need to start thanking him more.\n\nThen I went IKEA to buy a bunch of things I need to create a space for myself, a space for writing, for building, and for growing. And also a house for my cat (fingers crossed)\n\nI spent 1500 here, and I felt so guilty, since I might have to take RM 40k out of my dads pocket with this surgery, not to mention with conditions of my teeth and skin. I'm using so much money. I don't think I'm having kids, I do not want to place this burden on my future kids, I don't have good genes.\n\nThe day ended with the night market. It was nice being back, I recalled some moments I had here when I was younger, when life used to be simpler, when my body was fine, when all I cared about at that time was to just have fun.\n\nI more optimistic than ever for the past 3 years, in light of the events today. It seems surgery is very much possible, and can cure me.\n\nI also realized money is so important. I need to find the right intersection of what I do that I find fun and enjoy, and what has financial returns that can bring financial freedom. Something I have to keep in mind more now that I'm already 22 and my parents are growing older. It's time to be more serious about what I do, and keep my family in mind. I need to start playing the right games.\n",

Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n> 1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n> 1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n> 1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n> 1. Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or jargon if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n> 1. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\n\n### Stephen King\n\n> 1. Get to the point.\n> 1. Write a draft. Then let it rest.\n> 1. Cut down your text.\n> 1. Be relatable and honest.\n> 1. Don’t care too much what others may think.\n> 1. Read a lot.\n> 1. Write a lot.\n\n### The Age of the Essay\n\nPaul Graham\n\n> An essay begins with a question. You notice a door that’s ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what’s inside.\n>\n> Surprise the reader by telling them something they always knew deep inside but didn’t bother to do the work to make it conscious.\n>\n> Collect surprises. It’s a trainable skill. The more anomalies you’ve seen, the more easily you’ll notice new ones.\n>\n> Pay attention to things you’re not supposed to. If you’re curious about something, trust your instincts. Don’t believe what you’re supposed to.\n>\n> Expressing ideas helps to form them. In a real essay you’re thinking out loud.\n>\n> Writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.\n>\n> Don’t plan. From paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their course. Real thought is full of false starts. An essay is a cleaned-up train of thought.\n>\n> Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.\n>\n> Aim for maximum surprise – things you didn’t know that contradict things you thought you knew. What surprises you?\n>\n> Ask ‘why’ about things that feel off. That’s where fruitful material is.\n>\n> Read it out loud and fix everything that doesn’t sound like conversation.\n>\n> Ask reviewers for two things: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing.\n>\n> Cut the boring bits.\n>\n> Make unconvincing bits more clear, or change what you’re saying if you’re wrong.\n\n### Bertrand Russell's Writing Rules\n\n> 1. A style is not good unless it is an intimate and almost involuntary expression of the personality of the writer, and then only if the writer’s personality is worth expressing.\n> 1. There are some simple maxims-not perhaps quite so simple as those which my brother-in-law Logan Pearsall Smith offered me-which I think might be commanded to writers of expository prose. **First**: never use a long word if a short word will do. **Second**: if you want to make a statement with a great many qualifications, put some of the qualifications in separate sentences. **Third**: do not let the beginning of your sentence lead the reader to an expectation which is contradicted by the end.\n> 1. Your writing is never as good as you hoped; but never as bad as you feared.\n",

A space where you're in your own head\n4. **get moving**, explore outside in search for inspiration, have a dance party, shake things up\n5. **looking is a skill**. being creative is all about looking at the world and taking in information in a different way\n6. **keep an ideas notebook** or sketchbook, jot things down when you wake up, throughout the day, and in bed. draw people.\n7. **take pressure off** yourself to produce, do something else and trust it will come - it always does\n8. take inspiration from others – but know when to look away\n9. **learn about the history of art**, artists absorb other artists. if you've discovered a simple idea, it almost always existed\n10. consume other culture – comedy, punk bands, articles and posts from friends\n11. **use mistakes to your advantage**, perfection is overrated and mistakes are often far more interesting\n12. **learn to love your own company**, you spend a lot of time on your own while creating\n13. work out what time of the day you get into the zone. study the patterns. maximize on it\n14. create close to home\n15. work, work, work. artists don't switch off. \"it's like a flow I can't turn off\", capture the fleeting ideas you don't have the time for now, but later\n16. **do something creative everyday**. carry a sketchbook try to sketch each day\n17. <mark>Talk to strangers</mark>, your world and insights will open up as you hear a different worldview, even if you don't agree with them.\n18. **don't force creativity** – take a break to reset the creative flow, get out of the house and see the world go by, call a loved one, shake out the tension until you're ready to get to it again\n19. if all else fails - **do nothing**.\n20. be creative without realising. \"everybody works in a creative way in order to survive life\", \"it is part of the human experience\"\n",

I appreciated the format of this book, it's a list of 9 HOW TOs applicable to life, and I while I was reading, I was the reader of my own self.\n\n### Love Life\n\n- \"what would you do in your last hour?\"\n- \"our dissatisfaction were more the result of a certain way of living than of anything irrevocably morose about human experience\"\n- if mortality encourages you to reevaluate your priorities, ask yourself what your priorities are\n- if you've been living a half-life before this, what does a whole life consist of?\n- we shouldn't need a cataclysm to love life today, it would be enough to think that we are humans, and that death may come this evening\n\n### Read for Yourself\n\n- \"one cannot read a novel without ascribing to the heroine the traits of the one we love\"\n- \"every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self\"\n- \"art can properly affect rather than distract us from life\"\n- The value of a novel is not limited to its depiction of emotions and people akin to those in our own life; it stretches to an ability to describe these far better than we would have been able, to put a finger on perceptions that we recognize as our own, but could not have formulated on our own\"\n\n### Take Your Time\n\n- \"greatness of works of art has nothing to do with the apparent quality of their subject matter, and everything to do with the subsequent treatment of that matter\"\n- \"everything is potentially a fertile subject for art and we can make discoveries as valuable in an advertisement for soap as in Pascal's Pensées\"\n- \"n'allez pas trop vite - an advantage of not going by too fast is that the world has a chance of becoming more interesting in the process\"\n- \"Hang on to the performance, read the newspaper as though it were only the tip of a tragic or comic novel, use thirty pages to describe a fall into sleep when need be\"\n\n### Suffer Successfully\n\n- \"Love is an incurable disease.\" In love, there is permanent suffering\". Those who love and those who are happy are not the same\"\n- pain is subjective: \"we cannot allow ourselves to judge the legitimacy of another's pain simply on the basis of the pain we would have suffered had we been similarly afflicted\"\n- \"feeling things (usually means feeling them painfully) is at some level linked to the acquisition of knowledge\"\n  - \"being jilted by a lover is a perfect introduction to the mechanisms of emotional dependency\"\n- \"we don't really learn anything probably until there is a problem, until we are in pain, until something fails to go as we had hoped\"\n- \"we become properly inquisitive only when distressed. We suffer, therefore we think, and we do so because thinking helps us to place pain in context. It helps us to understand its origins, plot its dimensions, and reconcile ourselves to its presence.\"\n- \"we cannot be taught wisdom, we have to discover it for ourselves by a journey which no one can undertake for us, an effort which no one can spare us\"\n- \"... a relationship between the degree of pain a person experiences and the profundity of thought he or she may have as a result\"\n- \"It is grief which develops the strengths of the mind. These griefs put us through a form of mental gymnastics\"\n- \"if genuine priority is the development of our mental capacities, the implication is we would be better off being unhappy than contentment, better off pursuing tormented love affairs than reading Plato or Spinoza\"\n- it is not the contented who have left many profound testimonies of what it means to be alive, but the violently miserable, suffering is the perfect precondition for insight.\n- \"suffering opens up possibilities for intelligent, imaginative inquiry – possibilities that may quite easily be, and most often are, overlooked or refused\"\n- \"far greater wisdom would seem to lie in pursuing ways to properly and productively unhappy\"\n- the task is to gain a better understanding of reality. Pain is surprising: we cannot understand why (we're suffering). Identifying reasons for such discomforts does not absolve us of pain, but may form the principal basis of a recovery. While assuring that we are not uniquely cursed, understanding grants us a sense of boundaries to, and bitter logic behind, our suffering.\n- \"too frequently, suffering fails to alchemize into ideas, instead of a better sense of reality, it pushes us into a baneful direction where we learn nothing new, where are subject to many more illusions and entertain far few vital thoughts than if we had never suffered to begin with\"\n- these are bad sufferers: people who learn nothing from their sufferings, and instead, react to them with a variety of ruinous defense mechanisms which entail arrogance and delusion, cruelty and callousness, spite and rage.\n\n### Express your Emotions\n\n- \"there may be significant things to learn about people by looking at what annoys them the most\"\n- \"find the right words for things\", don't just say \"That's nice.\", it prevents ourselves or our interlocutors from really understanding what we have lived through. \"We stay on the outside of our impression\"\n- \"The problem with cliché is not that they contain false ideas, but rather they are just superficial articulations of very good ones\"\n- \"the way we speak is ultimately linked to the way we feel, because how we describe the world must at some level reflect how we first experience it\"\n- \"wanting to sound like other people has it's temptation. there are inherited habits of speech guaranteed to make us sound authoritative, intelligent, worldly, appropriately grateful, or deeply moved\"\n- \"they begin to write well only on condition they're original, that they create their own language\"\n- \"Only that which bears the imprint of our choice, our taste, our uncertainty, our desire and our weakness can be beautiful\"\n- \"giving to what we feel a form of expression which differs so much from, and which nevertheless after a little time take to be, reality itself\"\n- \"our notion of reality is at variance with actual reality, because it is often shaped by inadequate or misleading accounts\"\n- \"[Monet] has freed himself from traditional, and in some ways limited, representations of La Havre, in order to attend more closely to his own, uncorrupted impressions of the scene\n- \"in every successful work of art: an ability to restore to our sight a distorted or neglected aspect of reality\"\n\n### Be a Good Friend\n\n- \"Marcel was passionately interested in his friends. Never have I seen less egoism, or egotism ... He wanted to amuse you. He was happy to see others laughing and he laughed\" – Georges De Lauris\n- \"Never, right up to the end, neither his frenzied work, nor his suffering made him forget his friends – because he certainly never put all his poetry into his books, he put as much into hsi life\" - Walter Berry\n- the likelihood of honesty in friendship is highly dependent on how much is on our minds (true but hurtful) thoughts and their tolerance to the truth (how ready others will be to break off the friendship given the honesty)\n- \"I feel infinite sadness at seeing how few people are genuinely kind\"\n- \"My only consolation when I am really sad is to love and ot be loved\"\n- \"He should always be the one to ask questions and address himself to what was on your mind rather than risk boring you with what was on his\"\n- \"conversations required an abdication of oneself in the name of pleasing others in the name of pleasing companions.\n- \"it was not for elucidating, egoistically, things that one was interested in (friendship). It was primarily for warmth and affection\"\n- \"i do my intellectual work within myself, and once with other people, it's more or less irrelevant to me that they're intelligent, as long as they're kind, sincere etc\"\n- \"I like you and I would like you to like me\"\n- every friendship demands a degree of insincerity: \"the ever-present requirement to deliver an affable but hollow word to a friend who proudly shows us a volume of her poetry or her newborn baby\"\n- discern the incompatibilities of truth and affection, divide their projects, make a wise separation\n\n### Open your Eyes\n\n- \"our sense of beauty was not immobile, and could be sensitized by painters, who would, through their canvases, inculcate in us an appreciation of once neglected aesthetic qualities\"\n- \"great painters possess such power to open our eyes because of the unusual receptivity of their own eyes to aspects of visual experience: the play of light on the end of a spoon, ..., pinkish tones on an old man's skin – qualities that can inspire our impressions of beauty\"\n- happiness may emerge from taking a second look; our dissatisfactions may be the result of failing to look properly at our lives rather than the result of anything inherently deficient about them.\n- \"it isn't his life that has been mediocre as much as the image of it he possessed in memory\" (images which preserve nothing of life)\n- \"beauty is something to be found, rather than passively encountered, it requires us to pick up on certain details.\"\n- simple images provide certainties, ex: spending money makes you happier, aristocrats who are more educated and well-spoken have more class, that formal education, factual knowledge and university degree = intelligence\n\n### Be Happy in Love\n\n- the limits lie not in love, but in the \"general difficulty of maintaining an appreciative relationship with anything or anyone that was always around\n- the idea of love feels like a vague, chimerical dream, and after having it, it can grow chimerical and vague\n- \"he will soon forget what is there to be grateful, because the memory of Gilberte-less life will fade, and with it, evidence of what there is to savor.\"\n- \"we're creatures of habit, and therefore always liable to grow contemptuous of what is familiar\"\n- \"Presence may be the very element that encourages us to ignore or neglect it, because we feel we may have done all the work simply in securing visual contact\"\n- \"deprivation quickly drives us into a process of appreciation\"\n- \"learn a lesson of what we naturally do when we lack something, and apply it to conditions where we don't\"\n- \"if long acquaintance with a lover breeds boredom, ..., it may be we do not know him or her well enough\"\n- \"suffer the interval between desire and gratification, ..., it allows people to know and fall deeply in love with paintings in Dresden, hats, dressing gowns, and someone who isn't free this evening\"\n- secrets to long-lasting relationships: \"Infidelity, not the act itself, but the threat of it. An injection of jealousy is the only thing capable of rescuing a relationship ruined by habit\"\n\n### Put Books Down\n\n- there is a danger of taking books too seriously, a healthy relationship (with books) would depend as much on an appreciation of their limitations as of their benefits\n- \"The universe suddenly regained infinite value in my eyes\" on works of John Ruskin. \"he found experiences that he had never been more than semiconscious of raised and beautifully assembled in language\"\n- \"books can bring back to life, from the deadness caused by habit and inattention, valuable yet neglected aspects of experience\"\n- \"there is no better wya of coming to be aware of what one feels oneself than trying to recreate in oneself what a master has felt\" \"we should read other people's books in order to learn what we feel; it is our own thoughts we should be developing\"\n- all books can do is provide us with desires, \"That is the value of reading, and also its inadequacy. To make it into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it\"\n- dangers of books \"instead of awakening us to the personal life of the mind, reading tend to take its place, when the truth no longer appeals to us as an idea which we can realise only bt the intimate progress of our own thought and the efforts of our heart, but as something material, deposited between the leaves of books like honey fully prepared by others and which we only need to take the trouble to reach down from the shelves of libraries and then sample passively in a perfect repose of mind and body\"\n- good books can silence people\n  - \"his combination of the utmost sensibility with the utmost tenacity.

    "content": "\n![The Great Fire at Ryōgoku Bridge, Kobayashi Kiyochika, 1881](/images/fire.jpeg)\n\nI finished reading \"How Proust Can Change Your Life\" by Alain de Botton in the plane ride from Chicago to Istanbul, the layover at at the Istanbul airport, and from Istanbul back to Malaysia. I might've been awake for the past 24 hours, time is a blur.\n\nI seem to capable of reading books only on plane rides, it feels more justified. Why would I spend time reading fiction and non-fiction when I could be coding, learning, and building? It seemed like opportunity cost that was too high. I already read articles on a daily basis. However, one of the habits I plan to build is to read physical books for ~30 minutes before bed. This way I can actually finish all the books I bought. And it might be good for my eyes and my sleep.\n\nI really enjoyed this book, it's more practical than reading Crime and Punishment or Great Expectations, where you're sucked into the story, forced to go through the torments, the heartbreaks, the sufferings of the characters. And at the end of reading it, you go \"Wow, what a story! how did the author dream up this entire book?\". Unless you put in the work to study the characters, the psychology behind them, the hidden context, the implicit meaning lying in between the words, you don't really get much from reading books like this. Sure you remember faint snapshots about Raskolnikov's mental anguish and psychological torment after committing a gruesome murder, and Pip's impoverished background and his rise in social status, but it's hardly applicable to your own life.\n\nIn this book, I got to learn about the interesting, eccentric, bedridden, generous, relatable, character who is Proust, a French novelist who wrote a really long book called _In Search of Lost Time_. From his book, Alain extracts key life lessons from his personal background and the fictional (but also very real)characters from his book.\n\nFrom lessons about how to love life today and suffer successfully, to express your emotions, being a good friend, and being happy in love, they're filled with personal accounts of his life experiences.\n\nI found his ideas on how to **suffer successfully** extremely rewarding, especially at very moment in my life. The painful moments where I couldn't eat 99% of the food served on the plane because of my tremendously inconvenient food restrictions, when I have pains from stretching and moving my chest due to the inflammations, even from breathing too deeply, when I have heartburn and consistent, dull, pain below my ribs probably because of the high altitude or the messed up eating schedule, when I can feel my throat burning, my breathing forcibly and uncomfortably strained the entirety of my long, painful existence, I think about how to suffer successfully in light of all this, how not to be a \"bad sufferer\" as he calls it, and succumb to pessimism, to be stuck in a violently miserable state, to turn off all emotions and sensibility and isolate myself from the world, and ultimately flirting with the lingering thoughts about ending it all.\n\nAfter distracting myself with two Sherlock Holmes movie series portrayed by R.D.J., and a third of a quarter of Harry Potter The Deathly Hallows, when my plane landed in Malaysia, I felt immense sadness and yearning. The state of my health shoved me into a corner where I had to give up what I fought for for the past 2 years, the internship hunts and the interviews, the constant pressure to always be learning and growing or I'll never be good enough to land a job, the inability to relax and rest because I was an international student, and by default, I had to work 10x harder. Failure to me meant going back home after graduation, it meant I wasn't good enough, that I failed to live up to my potential, that I have to continue to depend on my father who's already 61 years of age to pursue graduate school. Failure is more complicated and harder to define when it's something out of my control. An external bad actor that has a mind of it's own and specializes in making my life miserable. I can't will myself out of gerd, out of my sensitive skin, my inflammations, and other defects of my body that I attribute to my horrible genes. Perhaps failure is setting the wrong expectations, expectations that do not match reality. I came to the US, already sick, so I probably should've prepared myself for the possible outcome of returning home after graduation.\n\nI keep picturing healthy me living the life I always wanted, yet a realistic picture would be unhealthy me attempting to continue to survive with a deteriorating body. Truth is I was really depressed the entire time I was in the US, even when I was in California, especially when I was travelling around to all these new places, going to good restaurants, and trying new things, my limitations became more stronger and evident, I realized more things that I couldn't do as my opportunities and possibilities expanded. I found it hard to live with myself, to be trapped in a body that I did not want to live in, to be forced a hand in the game of life, where I no longer could exercise, an extremely important part of my life which helped me de-stress and build strength and endurance, something people who are perfectly fine do not perform because they're lazy. I couldn't move freely anymore. I had no freedom.\n\nThat said, I miss a lot of things about the US, and everything I see and hear in Malaysia just makes me miss them more. I'm leaving what to me, is a better life in all aspects. A higher paying job, my friends, good weather, old bookstores, California and Boston and Seattle, the tech industry, the hackathons, the cold, the accents, the culture, the atmosphere, my comfy room with 0 mess. I miss all this. a lot. Perhaps I should heed the advice of Proust, to see the beauty in everyday objects and things, take my time on what seems boring at first, to not let snobbery get in the way of appreciation of my culture, my home, and my people.\n\nChange is hard, especially one of this degree. We seek comfort in what is familiar and we avoid discomfort and change and potential for growth. We are creatures of habit, and bad habits (often times unconscious) are sinister. We take for granted much of the blessings in our lives, the people especially. We fail to live a good life because we're afraid. We fear the unknown, the terrifying thought of not knowing what to do with your life, the paralyzing notion that everything we do has no meaning and your life adds up to nothing but a speck in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI don't know what the purpose was for writing all this, I'm currently very jet-lagged and tired, but I have too many thoughts on my mind, usually they go in loops, never-ending cycles of grief. So writing this helps quiet it down, it gives a channel for it to flow, instead of an sporadic mini explosions, it's controlled, I'm calling the shots, I let it explode all at once.\n\nI'm also writing to remind myself of the good. It's something I often overlook and forget. I fail to see what I already have, and I only see what I don't. The dangers of having something is it forget what it was like to not have something. And the easier it was to obtain it, where the delay between desire and gratification is short, the lesser the appreciation.\n\nSo to remind myself: I have a loving family and a home to come back to and a father who can expense my medical bills to help figure out what's wrong with my body and fix it. I have a mother who is caring and is willing to cook and care for me, and a sister who does the same. I have the freedom to pursue my interest in this break, and I have no major responsibilities or ties that can promote stress and anxiety, although most of it is self-inflicted and arises in my own work assigned by the high expectations I set for myself. I have a place to call home and a family who is helping me get back on my feet. That alone should be enough reason to not be depressed about not being in the US. Everything else, the friends I have in my life, the books, programming pursuits, and art, are blessings that I shouldn't take for granted.\n\nI'll drop some notes on the Proust book tomorrow. Until then.\n",

    "content": "\nSome notes & questions from reading [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/).\n\n- **values**\n  - `let` for constants, `var` for variables\n  - `\\(var)` for string variables (kinda weird)\n- **control flow**\n  - parentheses around conditions optional, braces around body (like JS)\n  - write `if` or `switch` after `=` (inline conditional)\n  - optionals:\n    - `?` after value to mark value as **optional**\n    - `if let` to create optional variables\n    - `??` to use default value if optional value is missing\n  - `_` can be used like in Python for unnamed vars\n  - tuples like Python\n  - switch case supports any kind of data\n  - `..<` to make range of index\n    - ex: `0..<4` is 0 to 3, and `0...<4` includes 4\n- `func`\n  - functions are first-class types, it can return another function as its value and cane take a function as an argument\n  - **closures**\n    - functions are a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later\n    - code in closure can access to variables and functions available in scope where closure was created, even if in a different scope when executed\n- `class`\n  - declare methods and functions within class\n    - dot syntax to access properties and methods\n    - init to create initializer\n    - `deinit` for cleanup before object is deallocated\n  - subclasses\n    - `super.init` to access superclass init\n    - `override func myFunc()` to override superclass implementation\n  - `get` and `set`\n    - set explicit name like this `set(newVal)` or `newValue` is the implicit name\n  - `willSet` and `didSet`\n    - run code before and after setting new values\n  - optional values: write `?` before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting\n- `enum`\n  - Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them\n  - case values are actual values\n  - raw values start at 0 and increment by one each time\n  - use abbreviated forms (`.value`) anytime the value's type is already known\n- `struct`\n  - ex: initializers are enums, and can initialize with abbreviated form\n  - always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\n- `async await`\n  - how to use\n    - `async` to mark function that runs asynchronously\n    - call with `await`\n    - use `async let` to call async function and let it run parallel with other async code\n  - Tasks\n    - use `Task` to call async func from sync code, without waiting for them to return\n    - use `withTaskGroup` to structure concurrent code\n  - **actors**\n    - similar to classes, but they ensure that different asynchronous functions can safely interact with an instance of the same actor at the same time.\n    - use `await` keyword when calling a method on an actor or accessing one of its properties\n- `protocol`\n  - Classes, enumerations, and structures can all adopt protocols.\n  - use `mutating func` in `struct` when writing methods that modifies structure\n  - classes don't require marking as mutating because methods can always modify the class.\n  - `extension`\n    - add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties\n    - ex: add methods and props like this to Int type `7.simpleDescription` or `7.adjust()`\n  - can be used like a named type\n    - ex: objects of different types all conform to a single protocol\n    - when type is a **boxed protocol type**, methods outside protocol definitions aren't available\n    - ensures no accidental access of methods or properties the class implements in addition to its protocol conformance\n- error handling\n  - `throw` to throw error\n  - `throws` to mark a function that can throw errors\n  - ways to handle\n    - `do-catch`:\n      - in `do`, write `try` in front of code\n      - in `catch`, errors are given name `error` by default\n    - multiple catch blocks\n      - handle specific errors\n      - name errors like `catch let printerError as PrinterError` (`PrinterError` is enum which adopts `Error` protocol)\n    - optionals\n      - `try?`: if function throws error, specific error is discarded and result is nill, else result is optional containing the value returned by function\n    - `defer`\n      - block of code that is executed after all other code, just before function return\n      - executed regardless of error or not\n      - can write setup code and cleanup code next to each other\n- generics: `<myGeneric>`\n  - there are generic forms of func and methods, as well as class, enum, and structs.\n  - use `where` to specify list of requirements\n    - require type to implement a protocol, require to types to be equivalent, to require a class to have a particular superclass, etc.\n\nthoughts\n\n- unwrapping values\n  - feel like this will be used a lot in ios dev, I use this a lot in react\n- closures\n  - ({}) to write closers\n- custom argument labels in functions\n- raw values\n  - another name for default values in an enum?\n- structs\n  - why is this important? \"structures are always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\"\n- concurrency\n  - what does calling async functions from sync code mean?\n- task groups\n  - is task group basically a grouper for async?\n- is actor basically classes but with async features\n- is it common to extend types?\n- how often is protocol used? seems like it's a way to enforce some properties of a class\n- is generic a type of types?\n\nAfter thought:\n\nThis was my first time reading through the docs of a new programming language, coming from R initially from Coursera, and Python with textbooks and hackathons, and hacking with Typescript for React and Next.js for side projects, I discovered I have a lot of gaps in programming knowledge. I've never used struct and protocols, and a lot of other concepts were foreign to me. It feels like I'm actually learning how to program for real.\n\nIt can only go up from here. I'm glad I have GPT 4 to help me understand these concepts better.\n",

I find intrinsic motivation the most powerful generator for focus. If it's something that provides meaning and purpose, it induces flow, and flow is focus.\nIf you're not intrinsically motivated, utilize extrinsic motivation, make finishing the task satisfying and reward yourself with what you find rewarding.\n\nSet accountability strategies, I stream myself working because there's a sense of someone watching me and provides the pressure. Tell your friends/the public about your plans, that way failing has a \"cost\", your risk appearing untrustworthy and breaking a social contract. Make failing painful. Make it hurt.\n",

    "content": "\nIt's the start of a new year.\n\nWhat better way to start, than learning about learning, for programmers.\n\nThe day before, I wrote about learning to code. Today, we go one step further and learn about learning itself.\n\nBelow outlines [10](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2024/1/278891-10-things-software-developers-should-learn-about-learning/fulltext) research-backed findings about learning that apply to software developers, and their practical implications.\n\n### tl;dr\n\n- learning takes time, including time between learning. use spaced repetition. take breaks between learning sessions (90 min)\n- learn to chunk information by practicing more problems, recognizing patterns, to boost your working memory functionally and build up a mental library of patterns\n- spend time away from a problem, take a walk, chat with friends and family\n- internet and AI is a double-edged sword, use it cautiously, if your goal is to learn, think of an answer before searching, understand the answer deeply, go one step further, learn the deeper structure\n- use examples to go between abstract and concrete learnable facts (repacking <-> unpacking)\n- seek to succeed (rather than avoid failures) and believe that ability is changeable, that struggles are not dead ends but an opportunity to grow\n\n### 1. Human memory is not made of bits\n\n> tl;dr: human memory is fragile and unreliable, we're not just storing and retrieving like computers. but the benefit is problem solving and deep understanding by connecting knowledge together.\n\n- memory and learning: \"Learning means that there has been a change made in one's long-term memory.\"\n- with computers, we can store a series of bits and later retrieve the exact series of bits in memory; human memory is neither as precise nor as reliable.\n- computers have two operations: read and write. human memory has \"**read-and-update**\" operation, where fetching a memory can both strengthen and modify it – a process called <mark>reconsolidation</mark>.\n  - modification is more likely on recently formed memories\n- <mark>spreading activation</mark>: when trying to remember something, we activate a pathway of neurons to access the targeted information\n  - pathways can stay **primed for hours**\n  - this activation is not contained within one pathway, and cat spread to other connected pathways\n  - implications\n    - negative: recall can be unreliable as imprecise information can be mixed and conflated with target information\n    - positive: stepping away from problems can allow two unrelated areas to connect, arising creative and unique solutions. this is why taking walks and showers helps.\n\n### 2. Human memory has one limited and one unlimited system\n\n> tl;dr: when faced with a task beyond your ability, reorganize it, decompose it into smaller pieces that can be processed and chunked. reduces extraneous load, boost working memory.\n\n- two main components of memory\n  - **long-term memory**: information is permanently stored and is functionally limitless\n    - analogy: computer disk storage\n  - **working memory** (wm): used for consciously reasoning about information for problem solving and is limited.\n    - analogy: CPU registers\n- long-term vs wm\n  - wm is roughly fixed at birth, higher wm != higher general intelligence, but faster learning.\n  - ex: expert programmers can have low or high wm but it's contents of their long-term memory that mke them experts\n- <mark>chunking</mark>\n  - group multiple piece of information as one piece in wm\n    - ex: ben@gmail.com is one piece of information, and not a random string of characters\n  - more chunking == larger working memory, functionally\n  - how to chunk? practice using information and solving problems\n- <mark>cognitive load</mark>\n  - is amount of working memory **capacity**, demanded by task.\n  - two parts: intrinsic and extraneous\n    - **intrinsic**: how many chunks are necessary to achieve a task\n    - **extraneous**: unnecessary information that is part of performing the task\n    - ex: presentation format varies extraneous cognitive load. a implementing a a database schema is better with diagrams than plain text (you have to mentally transform them)\n    - **if you're a beginner, extraneous load is higher** because you can't distinguish intrinsic and extraneous easily.\n\n### 3. experts recognize, beginners reason.\n\n> tl;dr: experts can reason at higher level by pulling from their mental library of patterns, freeing up cognition.\n\n- cognition is split into system 1 & 2\n  - System 1: fast, pattern recognition in long-term memory\n  - System 2: slower, reasoning in working memory\n- experts are experts because they've done <mark>pattern matching</mark> a lot more than beginners. like chess players who can remember and recognize the state of the board, programmers recognize \"design patterns\"\n- beginners can become experts by reading and understanding a lot of code\n- seeing a variety of programming paradigms so you have a wide pool of patterns.\n\n### 4. understanding a concept goes from abstract to concrete and back\n\n> tl;dr: experts look at generics and abstract ters, beginners focus on surface details and can't see the big picture\n\n- making <mark>[semantic waves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0898589812000678)</mark>\n  - when learning a new concept, you benefit from both forms of explanation: abstract features and concrete details with examples, and **switching between them**.\n  - <mark>unpacking</mark>: gather several diverse examples (even wrong ones) of a concept to learn an abstract concept\n  - <mark>repacking</mark>: deeper understanding through recognizing how multiple details from examples connects to the abstract concept\n- abstract -> concrete\n  - when learning abstract concepts, you reach for concrete instantiations of concepts to examine\n  - as concepts get more abstract (values -> variables -> functions -> metaclasses), distance to concrete examples increases\n  - the saving grace is, as we learn abstract concepts, they become more concrete (a chunk) to us.\n\n### 5. Spacing and repetition matter\n\n> tl;dr: space out practice across multiple sessions, days, and ideally weeks, rest is important to consolidate information\n\n- <mark>spacing effect</mark>\n  - works because of relationship between long-term & working memory\n  - when practice solving problems, it's two skills\n    - 1\\) **match**: pattern matching information to concepts that can solve it\n      - requires activating correct neural pathway in long-term memory\n    - 2\\) **apply**: applying the concepts to create solutions\n  - why space out?\n    - if you repeatedly solve the same problem, pathway stays active, so skill #1 is not practiced.\n    - not spacing out -> people can only solve problems when told which concept to use\n    - interleaving different problems -> pathways take time to return to baseline, making spacing necessary to get the most out of practice time (because your brain needs to rest and reset)\n- learning sessions\n  - limit to <mark>90 minutes or less</mark>\n  - take 20 minutes to rest after each session, really rest by going for a walk / sitting quietly\n  - rest speeds up consolidation process (also happens during sleep)\n- maximizing efficiency for learning\n  - **randomize order** of type of problems being solved, so different concepts are activated in long-term memory\n  - take **short breaks** at random intervals to enhance memory consolidation\n    - 10s break every 2-5 min is recommended\n\n### 6. internet has not made learning obsolete\n\n> tl;dr: be more careful about using AI as beginners, try to think of an answer before searching. there's a difference between a beginner who has never learned the details and lacks memory connection, and an expert who has learned deeper structure but has forgotten the fine details.\n\n- AI tools can write code, and knowledge is available from internet within seconds, but do you understand/learn anything?\n- learning is required to become an expert\n  - learning = storing bits of knowledge in long-term memory and <mark>forming connections</mark> between them\n  - if knowledge is not present in the brain, it's because you have not learned it well, and the brain cannot form any connections between them\n  - higher levels of understanding and abstraction are not possible\n- why searching internet bad\n  - less efficient for remembering information (compared to physical books)\n  - immediately searching is worse recall of same information, rather than thinking of an answer first\n  - searching robs the brain of benefits of memory-strengthening effect of recalling information\n- context switching\n  - searching requires switching working memory from task at hand (coding) to a new cognitive task (searching and filtering and assessing)\n  - if the knowledge is memorized, access is much faster (like a cache verses fetching from disk)\n\n### 7. problem-solving is not a generic skill\n\n> tl;dr: teaching problem-solving != teaching programming, we learn specific skills like programming, the best chess move, how to create a knitting pattern, each of these skills are separate and don't influence each other. teach programming with programming practice problems\n\n- problem-solving & programming\n  - problem-solving is a large part, but you can't directly teach it as a specific skill\n  - even though it can be applied to different aspects of programming (design, debugging), it's not a generic skill\n- domain-specific problem-solving > generic\n  - while we can learn to reason, <>we don't learn how to solve problems in general</mark>\n  - we learn specific skills and they are separate and don't influence each other\n  - ex: chess has little to no effect on other academic and cognitive skills.\n- spatial skills is an exception\n  - allows us to visualize objects in our mind\n  - can improve learning in other disciplines: such as performance on a range of non-verbal skills\n\n### 8. expertise can be problematic in some situations\n\n> tl;dr: experts who transfer knowledge from one language to another can lead to faulty knowledge. they also have difficulties seeing things through a beginner's lens.\n\n- transfer knowledge\n  - experts know multiple programming languages, and transferring knowledge between them can lead to errors\n  - ex: difference in semantics between languages between Java and C++ in inheritance\n- <mark>expert blind-spot problem</mark>\n  - experts have difficulty seeing things through the eyes of a beginner\n  - overcome this by listening carefully to beginners, check their understanding, and tailor accordingly\n- <mark>tacit knowledge</mark>\n  - knowledge becomes so automated that it's hard for experts to verbalize: \"i just know\"\n  - beginners can learn better from instructional materials or a knowledgable peer (bridges the gap between beginners and experts)\n\n### 9. predictors of programming ability are unclear\n\n> tl;dr: intelligent people will not always make good programmers, and good programmers need not be high in general intelligence.\n\n- aptitude + practice\n  - a mix of this is needed for success in anything\n  - purely aptitude \"you're born with it\" and purely practice \"10,000 hours\" idea are two extreme views.\n- years of experience?\n  - there is weak link between years of experience and success in early career\n  - aptitude may be stronger than experience in early years\n- weak predictors\n  - (in early programming) **general intelligence** and **working memory capacity**\n  - these predict <mark>rate of learning</mark> rather than absolute ability\n  - spatial reasoning is a stronger predictor of success in programming, though still quite moderate\n\n### 10. mindset matters\n\n> tl;dr: a growth mindset helps you persist through challenges and overcome failures, but it takes effort to adopt the mindset. Seek help, take breaks, just because you're struggling doesn't mean you're not cut out for it.\n\n- programming ability is not binary: you can or cannot\n  - two theories\n    - <mark>learning edge momentum</mark>: each topic is dependent on the previous, so you will fall behind if you can't catch up\n    - geek gene: you're born with it or not (little empirical evidence)\n  - difference in programming ability = difference in prior experience\n    - ex: person A and B in same class, degree can have vastly different knowledge skills, either behind or ahead of learning edge momentum, making them seem \"born with it\" or not\n- fixed vs growth mindset\n  - **fixed mindset**: people's abilities are innate and unchanging. if you struggle, you're not cut out for it\n  - <mark>growth mindset</mark>: people's abilities are malleable. if you struggle, **with enough practice**, you can master it.\n  - the middle ground: anyone can learn Math, even if they're not initially good, but you won't get a Nobel Prize no matter how much you practice. However, with a growth mindset, you can **persist through difficulties and overcome failure more consistently**\n- growth mindset is hard to promote, misconceptions\n  - #1 reward effort than performance\n    - growth mindset favors practice over aptitude, so teachers reward effort, but learners aren't stupid, they know when they're not progressing.\n    - solution: only reward effort when learner is using effective strategies and is actually succeeding\n  - #2 growth mindset is static\n    - due to set backs and failure, people skew toward fixed mindset because the boundaries of their abilities are not clear\n    - solution: practice overcoming setbacks and failures\n- goal orientation: <mark>approach & avoidance</mark>\n  - **approach**: wanting to do well -> positive learning behaviours: working hard, seeking help, trying new challenges\n  - **avoidance**: avoiding failure -> negative behaviours: disorganized study, not seeking help, performance anxiety, avoiding challenge\n- how to adopt growth mindset\n  - seek honest feedback about your skill progression\n  - review the efficacy of your learning strategies\n    - note down times when you are doubtful\n  - expect shifts towards fixed mindset, but growth mindset can be redeveloped and made stronger with practice\n  - if you feel like quitting, take a break, take a walk, consider different strategies\n",

    "content": "\nLearning [how to program](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1) is a complex skill.\n\nYou won't reach the skill level of a hacker by simply accumulating languages.\n\nYou need to learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language.\n\nYou should reach a point where you can pick up a new language in days by relating to what you already know to the manual.\n\nSo what is the way?\n\nIs it books and courses? YouTube videos?\n\nSure you can learn language features, bits of knowledge, from these, but that won't turn you into a good programmer.\n\nThe mindset that turns that knowledge into a living skill can only be learned by **practice and apprenticeship**\n\nSo, what will do it is by <mark>reading code and writing code</mark>. Lots of it.\n\nLearning to program is just like learning to write good natural language.\n\nThe best way to do that is read some stuff written by great writers, then write some things yourself. Read a lot more, write a little more ... rinse and repeat until your writing begins to develop the kind of quality you see in your models.\n\nPeter Norvig has a great essay: [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html). Pay close attention to his \"recipe for programming success\".\n\nBut where can you find good code?\n\nOpen-source software, programming tools and operating systems are widely available.\n\nRead and tinker with the code base. Browse through the issues. Break stuff, fix them. Interact with the community. Write code. Solve problems.\n",

My graduation trip has been a lot of fun.\n\nRoad-tripping with a Kia Outlander, having Mt Rushmore all to ourselves cause it's winter, watching bisons cross the road right in front of us in Yellowstone, experiencing breathtaking sunsets on canyons and salt lakes, relishing the snowcapped mountains, spending Christmas in Seattle, seeing the great wave art in person, living in cabins and RVs, modern apartments, entire houses, and hotels, and entering myriads of antique malls, thrift stores, and bookstore throughout the trip, long hours driving listening to the Huberman lab podcast and chinese songs. I'm grateful I get to see all these places.\n\nIt's time to review my 2023.\n\nI've written some reflections on my life in my [birthday](http://bneo.xyz/posts/22) post and my [graduation](http://bneo.xyz/posts/isu) post, now it's time to answer some reflective questions, and look forward to 2024.\n\nIn an ideal world, I would be moving to the bay, maybe back with Tesla, dealing with housing, OPT documents, work contracts, getting a car and paying for car insurance, meeting up with my friends on the weekends, going to more events and hackathons, and live the life I wanted every since I started at INTI in 2019.\n\nBut life is never the way we plan, and there are things we cannot escape from, events out of our control.\n\nHowever, I'm doing grad school, so I have another shot at this.\n\nI had a hiatus back in 2020 when COVID hit, and it was 6 months of reading, learning, and exercising. So 2024 seems familiar to me, I'm going to have another gap break before my graduate school starts in Fall 24', but with more intention, bigger goals, and greater purpose.\n\nMy main goal is to fix the many issues of my body, dive into research and find the root cause, and get surgery to end the 3 years of suffering. I was stuck in the US, unable to get proper health care and support, so coming back was necessary.\n\nIf my health permits, I'm also going to explore my wide array of interests, and commit to learning, and more importantly, **building** everyday. Habits are essential to learning, so I aim to pick up some daily habits for coding and reading, like how I'm doing in this blog.\n\nTo really reflect upon, and look forward to the new year, I've answered a list of questions from Twitter.\n\n### Capture\n\n1. What were your favorite songs, photos, videos, podcasts, movies?\n   - songs: Kiss of Venus, lots others, mostly k indie and kpop\n   - photos: all the sunsets pictures I took\n   - videos: videos by Horses, great art explained\n   - podcasts: Huberman Lab, Lenny’s podcast\n   - movies: Boy and Heron, GOTG vol. 3\n2. What was your favorite reading?\n   - Books: Sun also rises, Death of Ivan, also the only two books I finished this year LOL. I need to read more.\n3. What were your favorite notes?\n   - maybe my class notes for 472, I’m not a big note taker\n4. What were your favorite courses?\n   - I actually enjoyed COM S 472 a lot, even though it was traditional AI, the programming assignments were fun.\n5. What was your favorite travel?\n   - SF & the bay: summer internship, hackathons and AI meetups and talks, traveling with parents to redwoods, Monterey, Big Sur, and nice like Mountain View, Sunnyvale\n   - Toronto: first time visiting Canada for the Airflow conf in Sept, lived in Chinatown and got to walk around UofT\n   - Boston: thanksgiving trip with A, got to explore bookstores and museum, loved the culture and history\n   - Seattle & others: graduation trip with family, from Ames -> SD -> Wyoming -> Montana -> Washington -> Oregon -> Idaho -> Utah -> Colorado -> Nebraska -> Ames\n6. What were your favorite events/milestones?\n   - NCUR in Wisconsin, getting a drivers license, meeting new people at Tesla, hiking Yosemite falls, driving around the bay with parents, winning Anthropic Hackathon in SF, touring Alcatraz Island with 3 different friend groups, sketching howl’s moving castle, traveling alone to Toronto, CA for airflow conference, carving a pumpkin, going to Boston in Thanksgiving, shipping narrative with Wei Chun, graduating, Christmas in Seattle.\n7. What are you most grateful for?\n   - family and friends\n\n### Organize + Distill\n\n8. What was your biggest surprise?\n   - how much influence and emotion (positive and negative) a single person can bring about\n9. What risks did you take?\n   - initiating conversations with people in SF even though it was uncomfortable, being vulnerable and opening up to people\n10. How would you describe the year?\n    - filled with memorable experiences, lots of traveling, new friendships, lots of health hardships and having to fight it alone, psychological and physical pain\n11. Which aspect was most challenging/most easeful?\n    - managing GERD and other health issues, it prevents me from exercising and eating well, and impacts my energy levels throughout the day. It’s hard to be productive without good health.\n12. Where did you invest your time? Where would you have liked to invest more or less?\n    - I invested a lot of time into curating and diving into rabbit holes, i would like to invest more in building and creating, than consuming.\n13. Most influential people in your life last year.\n    - summer friends, curius people, a designer friend\n14. Top 3 wins for the year.\n    - summer internship, surviving GERD, graduating\n15. What were your disappointments from the year?\n    - rejected by Glassdoor\n    - not submitting anything for ScaleAI and winning other AI hackathons\n    - rejected by Tesla data engineering for Fall\n    - working on (mostly) pointless projects at Tesla\n    - not finishing online courses I started\n    - not tutoring/doing CS research\n16. What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned?\n    - that health is never guaranteed, human relationships are complex and messy, inspiration is so fleeting so act on it immediately. you can just ask people for things. DM people, ask to chat with them, you can learn a lot from mentors.\n17. What are you letting go of?\n    - regrets, toxic friendships, my default depressive state.\n18. What advice would you give yourself?\n    - stop thinking so much, don’t get too attached to things and people, actively fight against cynicism and pessimism, set a schedule for yourself, you’re too easily distracted to be working freely,\n\n### Express\n\n19. What brings you the most joy? (Do more of that)\n    - writing blogs, talking to friends, taking walks, sunrise and sunsets, going to old bookstores and museums, Japanese art, reading (and buying) good books, sharing good tools to friends, flowers, cute animals, building in hackathons, coding something fun.\n20.

I like building things that can solve problems, especially if they're important, social issues that can be tackled with technology. This is why I'm addicted to hackathons, they give me the motivation for building. But now that I'm out of school, and I have more time, I'm going to start committing to one idea, and see how far it can go, and build properly with my friend [WC](https://weichun.xyz/).\n\nSome notes on \"[The Hacker Attitude](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude)\" by Eric\n\nA hacker solves problems and builds things. They believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.\n\nTo become a hacker, you have to behave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself.\n\nAs with all creative arts, the most effective way is to imitate the mindset of masters – not just intellectually but emotionally as well.\n\nSo if you want to be a hacker, you have to repeat the following things until you believe them:\n\n1. The world is full of fascinating problems **waiting to be solved**.\n   - being a hacker is a lot of fun, but the kind of fun that takes a lot of energy\n   - **intrinsic motivation**: you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence\n   - **faith**: you have to develop a belief that even though you don't have all the pieces to solve a problem, you can learn and solve it piece by piece, and do that until you're done.\n2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.\n   - **don't reinvent the wheel**: creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. don't waste time re-addressing old problems, there are many fascinating new problems out there\n   - **share**: it's almost a moral duty to share information, solve problems and give solutions away so hackers can solve new problems\n3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.\n   - **solve new problems**: hackers should never be bored or have have to drudge at stupid repetitive work. This wastefulness hurts everybody.\n   - **automate**: automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everybody else\n4. Freedom is good.\n   - naturally **anti-authoritarian**: anyone who can give orders can find some stupid reason to stop you from solving problems you're fascinated by, fight the authoritarian attitude wherever you find it.\n   - **cooperate and share information**: develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and use of force or deception to compel responsible adults.\n5. Attitude is **no substitute** for competence.\n   - attitude alone is not enough, it takes intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.\n   - distrust attitude and **respect competence of every kind**\n   - competence at demanding skills that few can master is especially good, and ones that involve mental acuteness, craft, and concentration is best.\n   - if you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself – the <mark>hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than drudgery</mark>\n\nMore resources\n\n- PG's essay, [Great Hackers](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html) and [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html)\n- [Things Every Hacker Once Knew](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/things-every-hacker-once-knew)\n- [How To Ask Smart Questions](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)\n",

In fact, it may even incorporate resignation and a little dissatisfaction. MUJI’s goal is to sweep away that slight dissatisfaction, and raise the level of the response, “This will do” to one filled with clarity and confidence.\n\nI wonder if this concept can extend to software products. A lot of software today has dark patterns hiding behind vibrant and colorful buttons and icons, designed to hack our attention and overstimulate us.

It was just clouds.\n\nI tried to go back to sleep, but ended up scrolling twitter and cosmos.\n\nI finally got out of bed to eat breakfast at 10:30 a.m.\n\nIt was raining outside. You could only see the faint outline of the city. The mountains were hidden behind the fog.\n\nI sat with my family on the second floor to have oatmeal drenched in flaxmilk, cut bananas and apples, and tasty sweet potato chips from whole foods.\n\nMy family commented about how new the airbnb is, and my dad started discussing about credit card bills.\n\nI continued scrolling twitter.\n\nI felt a little sick after, and went back to lie on the bed.\n\nI wanted to work on my birth of Christ sketch.\n\nMy sister cracked open the window behind us.\n\nThe sound of the rain and the slight breeze made me sleepy.\n\nI fell asleep at some point.\n\nI woke up at 3:30 p.m. with the tablet in my hands.\n\nMy sister and dad went to Safeway to get soy sauce.\n\nI got on twitter again.\n\nI felt better now, and continued my sketch upstairs at the kitchen countertop.\n\nMy other sister and my mum watched youtube on the tv above the fireplace.\n\nI finished my sketch, I felt satisfied with the end result. I took two breaks for this sketch, I usually finish sketches in one sitting because I don't have the patience nor the accountability to finish them if I don't.\n\nI continued going on rabbit-holes, organizing my tabs, and writing blogs for the rest of the year.\n\nMy sister started cooking dinner with the meat we bought from whole foods last night.\n\nThe fire alarm kept going off because of the smoke.\n\nWe cracked every window and the cold breeze came uninvited to the living room, colliding with the heavy smell of fatty meat crawling from the kitchen, travelling across the entire apartment.\n\nAn old friend from church called, she's 7 months pregnant. I'm reminded of my younger self and feel old. Time is moving fast.\n\nI pan-fry my salmon. The flesh is golden and the skin is crisp, I plated it thinking it was done but it was slightly undercooked. I put it back.\n\nThe fire alarm went off again.\n\nMy sister took out the French lamb rack from the oven, it smells good.\n\nIt was finally time to eat. It's 8 p.m.\n\nThere were baked vegetables and potatoes, stir-fried brocolli, steak, lamb, and salmon.\n\nWe talked about plans for tomorrow, about the meal, about the trip, and about the future.\n\nThe lamb was really good. The meat was tender and the flavor rich.\n\nI got heartburn from the fattiness of the meat. I couldn't feel happy.\n\nI went to take a shower and went to bed.\n\nI started planning the spots to hit tomorrow and the day after.\n\nI spent the rest of the night discovering and organizing information, and writing these blogs. I haven't been doing anything else lately. I like doing it. I finally get to just do this and nothing else. It's a privilege. It's an addiction. Maybe a distraction too.\n\nIt's now 12:50 a.m.\n\nThis was my Christmas day.\n",

    "content": "\n> A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse.\n\n[Second-order thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/) is the practice of not just considering the consequences of our decisions, but also the <mark>consequences of those consequences</mark>.\n\nEveryone can do first-order thinking, which is just the immediate anticipated result of an action. It's quick and requires little effort. Second-order thinking is more complex and time-consuming, but it can get you extraordinary results.\n\nHere's an example in [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/), as described by the man himself.\n\n> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”\n\nIn it's most concise version, Chesterton's Fence states:\n\n\"Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.\"\n\nSome examples of 2nd order thinking\n\n- hierarchy-free companies: removing structure altogether at companies doesn't address why hierarchies must exist in the first place; people will form hierarchies, which is far more complex to navigate, where the most charismatic will take control, rather than the most qualified\n- company culture: chief financial officer cutting cost by doing away the free snacks and sodas. this can prompt talent to jump ship, costing far more in employee turnover in an attempt to save a relatively small amount of money\n- habits: removing a bad habit, without eliminating the need or replacing it with a better one, can lead to a more harmful habit to take its place\n\nSo what's the takeaway?\n\nIt's not that you can't make improvements.\n\nIt's a reminder that we don't always know better than the people who made decisions before us, and we can't see all the nuances to a situation until we're intimate with it.\n\nUnless you know why someone made a decision, you can't safely change it or conclude they were wrong.\n\nThe first step is to understand it. Observe it fully. Notice how it interconnects with other aspects, especially the ones not linked to you closely.\n\nLearn how it works, then propose a change.\n",

People listen to you because you're a **good writer**, not because you're a good programmer. Take any argument about \"objective truth\" with a grain of salt.\n2. Don't be worried about learning \"the wrong thing\", **learning is all about trying new ideas** and making mistakes, and iterating from them.\n3. Read [Debugging: The 9 rules](https://debuggingrules.com/), it's an important skill that beginners lack\n4. At some point you'll discover the **Right Way** to program, it could be TDD, functional, OOP or a million other things, and be convinced this is the only way. You'll learn that programming is frustrating and messy regardless of which Right Way people use, and you can make great software without it. You'll learn that there are 50 other Right Ways and learn to mix and match with the problem at hand\n5. Don't hold it against the Right Way Guy who introduced you to the Right Way; **most ideas need some modification** from their purest form to integrate well with other ideas.\n6. \"behind every best practice is a horror story.\" - [Julie Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30YWsGDr8mA). if you don't understand the best practice, look for the horror story that inspired it. it might be irrelevant to you, and you can do a different practice instead.\n7. A lot of best practices and conventions are \"**path dependent**\", arising from a mix of historical and cultural factors. retrace the whole path and see if the things everyone is doing that is not as relevant anymore.\n8. <mark>Take walks</mark>\n9. Almost every tool has a **form of hidden depth**, from Python to git to Jira. Don't feel like you have to become an expert in all of them, but spend 5-10 minutes learning a bi more about what they can do.\n10. **Talk to people in other parts of the company**: support, sales, finance, etc. shadow them if you have the time.\n11. **Try different types of programming** earlier in your career. Most companies are doing several different kinds of programming, if you're starting in web dev, try some frontend, backend, ops, some data stuff. This helps you learn, and more importantly increases your chances of finding software work you actually like.\n12. Don't get swept up in framework treadmill, **focus on learning fundamental skills**. Why? information in software propagates really quickly due to (internet, OSS, conferences), and overall there's a lower barrier to sharing ideas in software. If you're excited about something, go ahead and be an early adopter, otherwise, wait a few years for it to grow legs.\n13. No one can predict the future. **Do the best you can, live according to your values, and enjoy the ride**.\n",

I hope to visit it one day and see it with my own eyes. It made me want to have my own garden in Europe, once I'm done fulfilling my dreams and aspirations in the US.\n\nI read this [piece](https://wonderground.press/gardens/audacious-gardening-daring-care/) from the Wonderground by [Georgina Reid](https://wonderground.press/contributor/georgina-reid/) and the way she thinks about gardening is radical.\n\nGardening is not valued. It's seen as a weekend task involving fighting with a lawn mower and is something people to do when they retire.\n\nIt's practical not philosophical, physical not metaphysical. It's not discussed seriously\n\nGardening can be a tool to combat the increasingly obvious and dangerous effect of climate change.\n\nGardening should happen everywhere.\n\n> I am a gardener. I can’t think of a more important responsibility. Gardening is not just a set of tasks. It’s not restricted to backyards, courtyards, balconies. It can, and should, happen anywhere, everywhere. Gardening is simply a framework for engagement with our world, grounded in care, action and intimacy with place. To garden is to care deeply, inclusively and audaciously for the world outside our homes and our heads. It’s a way of being that is intimately interwoven with the real truths of existence—not the things we’re told to value (money, status, ownership), but the things that actually matter (sustenance, perspective, beauty, connection, growth).\n\nWe need to be gardeners to protect our planet.\n\n> To be a gardener is to be invested in a place — to know it, to protect it, to be present to it. How can we protect and heal ourselves and our planet if we’re not willing to step into, and value, the role of the gardener?\n",

Accumulation\n   - time spent together is the most obvious force: it takes [40-60 hours](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225) within the first 6 weeks to turn acquaintance into casual friend, and 80-100 hours to become more than that\n   - “Being around someone 24 hours a day, you tell them everything, ... You don’t do [that] when you are home.”\n2. Attention\n   - there are more opportunities than you think to make friends\n   - “You have to look for friendship in places you would never expect it.\n   - pay attention, notice when you click with someone, be open to chance encounters, step out of your habits and into the moments\n3. Intention\n   - you need action, when opportunity arises, have the courage, vulnerability, and willingness to let things be awkward.\n   - friendship takes energy and thought; they take work. showing up for your friends take effort, but it should be joy.\n4. Ritual\n   - have something baked into your schedule so all you have to do is show up\n   - book clubs, monthly hikes, dinner parties, group chats than run all day, etc.\n5. Imagination\n   - society places friendship on the sideline, it's playing supporting roles to work, family, and romance; design your life so friendship plays the role you want\n   - ex: buying a house together, going therapy together, raising their children together, friends are people who choose to love each other radically every day.\n6. Grace\n   - the previous forces are ideas, they're impossible to fully live up to. life gets in the way\n   - friendship is flexible, it can bend to fit the shape of our lives.\n   - it doesn't always have to be about presence, it can be love that can weather absence\n   - the concept of grace: a gift so profound that it can never be earned or deserved\n     - offer forgiveness to each other when we fall short\n     - create a space for connection, and reconnections, that feel nothing short of miraculous.\n",

A gift economy nurtures the community bonds that enhance mutual well-being; the economic unit is “we” rather than “I,” as all flourishing is mutual.\n\nWhat makes a good gift?\n\nSome notes and ideas about gift giving from this piece on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/blog/gift-shop-talk).\n\n- everyone’s idea of a good gift is so different; One’s own standards for gifts does not necessarily apply to everyone\n- there is some kind of quality of empathy or something — really understanding the person you’re giving the gift to\n- the best gifts are usually from people who know you really well, and in a particular way\n- good gift givers are also very good at listening and then remembering that one thing you said that one time about wanting something\n- \"I also love when people give me playlists for my birthday\"\n- it’s that foresight, or the fact that someone has been thinking about you as they buy or make somethings\n- pragmatic gifts: “I don’t know this person that well, but I know they live in New York. If they’re like me, they probably don’t want another physical object for their small apartment. I’m going to give them something that will naturally disappear — something ephemeral — like flowers, incense, candles, etc.”\n- a good gift has an element of surprise — that’s key\n- the best gift is when it’s something you want and you’re positive that the other person would want it too, because you can feel like there’s an overlap of what you can both feel excited about.\n- [gift economy](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/the-serviceberry/), or reorienting your thinking around gifts and abundance rather than scarcity, changes our whole relationship to the world\n- gift-giving promotes a sense of reciprocity.\n- The first thing that you feel when you get a gift is gratitude, and the second is reciprocity, you want to give a gift in return. So it kind of creates this web of “mutual flourishing.”\n",

    "content": "\nTo do any great work, you need two fundamental assets: [taste and skill](https://refactoring.fm/p/taste-vs-skills).\n\nFor building products:\n\n- **Taste** is knowing what is good – being able to recognize it.\n- **Skill** is the ability to build – to do what is needed to do the work.\n\nThey are totally independent, you could have one or the other, but having both allows you to make truly great work.\n\nIt also helps in personal growth. The fundamental question is whether your skill is good enough for your taste.\n\nRight now, you could be in one of two scenarios\n\n### Taste > Skill\n\nwhen your taste is ahead of your skills, you are not satisfied with the work you produce.\n\nevery time you're unhappy with your work, it just means your taste for what is good is ahead of what you're able to create.\n\nThis is good. This means your skill has room to grow.\n\nYou have a voice in your head saying you can do better., a reference point of something you aren't able to achieve yet\n\n### Skill >= Taste\n\nWhen your skill is equal or higher than your taste, you're able to build what you believe is good.\n\nYou're happy with your work, but you also stop growing, unless you grow your taste first.\n\nThis dynamic between taste and skill is crucial.\n\n<mark>Skill is your floor, taste is your ceiling</mark>\n\nThe most effective way to improve your taste is by being **exposed** to what is good.\n\nTo create a good team, you have to work in one.\n\nThis makes good taste more valuable than good skills, the latter is easier to catch up with.\n\n### Closing the gap\n\nIf great taste is knowing what's good, and great skill is knowing how to build things, the third element is knowing why.\n\nKnow **what makes good things good**\n\nYou may study hundreds of artworks or great design work, and develop intuitive taste for good ones.\n\nBut unless you create your own designs, or paint or sketch, you learn what makes good things good, and ultimately allowing your **taste to turn into skills**\n\nThus, the two ways to help with closing the gap is:\n\n- just build stuff: your bad output constantly triggers your reasoning, question yourself \"why do I think this is crap?\"\n- discuss with others: elaborate on your judgement in your discussions. if you disagree on something being good, chances are you want to figure out why.\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- grow your taste – expose yourself to high-quality stuff\n- grow your skills on something you already have good taste for – e.g. learning design as a programmer\n- combine your taste and skills in a unique way – you know good design (taste) and you can code (skill)\n\nThis unique combination can help you decide what to work on and what to build as an entrepreneur.\n\nIt helps answer \"why me?\", and gives you the answer to these two important questions:\n\n- Why are you better positioned than most other people for doing that?\n- Why do you have a special shot at being successful?\n",

    "content": "\n![Unknown artist](/images/hope.jpeg)\n\nWow. I'm done. I finally get to leave Ames, Iowa.\n\nI remember back in INTI college in Malaysia when my friends and I were all applying for schools, I just went along with my friends and only applied for this school.\n\nI figured that would save money on the applications, and ISU was the most optimal choice for credit transfers, tuition and living cost, and friends.\n\nLooking back, I definitely would've applied to other schools. After California, I saw that the grass was greener. I could've had a better college life, made more friends, and got better internships.\n\nBut, I have to be grateful for the opportunity to study in the US. It's not an opportunity every Malaysian gets.\n\nI'm blessed to have a father who works hard to fund my educational and career goals.\n\nI'm going grad school anyways, I have a second shot at a \"college experience\", whatever that is.\n\nMy time here at Ames was pretty depressing. But there were good moments.\n\nThe beginning of it was nice, everything was new.\n\nNew apartment, new housemates, new classrooms, new weather, new life.\n\nIt was my first step into adulting.\n\nI started buying my own groceries, cooking my own meals, researched the best credit cards, managed my finances, paid taxes. Applied for jobs, interviewed, and learned how to communicate with people.\n\nA lot of \"adulting\" boxes that I wouldn't check if I stayed back home.\n\nWhat would be a fun college life experience in a small, quiet town is quickly filled with pain and suffering, inconveniences and boredom.\n\nWhile a normal student would go through issues of hard classes and bad grades, breakups, financial difficulties, sport injuries, I had to learn how to survive with GERD.\n\nIt creeps up on my life in all aspects.\n\nIn my sleep, my daily meals, my activities, every second of my life.\n\nDifficulty breathing. Heartburn. Sore throat. Stabbing pain on my stomach. A constant feeling of discomfort with my body. I've never felt myself since January 2021.\n\nIt was suffocating. I contemplated stopping college in the second semester when I had trouble eating and swallowing.\n\nHaving chronic health issues and being an international student are two things that contradict and are in conflict with each other. It doesn't make sense to be >8000 miles away and not be healthy. It made me realize and relate to the sad truth of how so many people cannot afford healthcare here in the US, such a basic right of human beings, and how it's much harder for me to achieve my dreams in the US.\n\nGoing to California was a breath of fresh air. I got to experience the bay area. The Silicon Valley. It was what I dreamt about when I started college. It was also my first job ever in my life. I got to work at the factory where Tesla cars are made and see Elon Musk in person. I made a lot of friends, saw a lot of places, ate good (limited) food. I grew a lot that summer.\n\nGoing back to Ames was just sad. It was like coming off from a high and back down to boring, flavorless Ames.\n\nThe one good thing was I moved to a new apartment where I could walk to classes <15 min. I started walking a lot more. I like walking.\n\nEverything was mostly a blur, besides classes and going to the library everyday to do work at the wide screen monitors, my environment was unchanging.\n\nAfter a really fun tokyo trip in winter, and the obligatory return to Malaysia, I came back to the cold and unforgiving weather, still trying to get an internship.\n\nEventually Tesla was the only company who wanted me for the summer, and I went back unwillingly, yet with gratitude that I could go back California.\n\nIt was another unforgettable summer. If the first summer was about being able to experience the bay, the second summer was about interacting with the people itself, and getting first-hand experience of the AI energy in SF. I had my parents with me for 3 weeks and got to drive around and explored with them. I went to church. I made more friends, saw old ones, had my first party experience, first meetups, first in-person hackathon. I remembered why I loved the bay and fell back in love with her again. If there's a place that can instill in you with the belief that anything is possible, it's SF.\n\nGoing back for my one final semester for one class was dreadful. I was actively trying to stay / go back after my 14-week internship was done.\n\nBut I'm glad with how my time here at Ames ended, I'm leaving on a good note. I'm really grateful for the chinese church and the people there who were filled with the love and kindness of God. It reminded me of the good in people, and that I have the responsibility to show it to others as well.\n\nClosing this chapter of my life, I learned a lot, but I still have a lot to learn.\n\nI'm still incredibly sick of living in this body. So, I'm glad I get to go home and fix my body. I'm going to do surgery and get my life back.\n\nAnd I'll be back stronger than ever.\n",

DISCOVER. REMEMBER</mark>\n\nThey encompass what the LAS degree means today.\n\n**Invent**: We'll be innovators and leaders. We'll use the creativity to address society's biggest challenges. We may even reinvent ourselves a few time over the course of your professional careers.\n\n**Discover**: We'll discover new scientific frontiers and new meaning through culture and the arts. We'll even help others discover their own potential.\n\n**Remember**: Remember who you are and the experiences that shaped you. Your culture, your family, your friendships, and your time as a cyclone. Your unique perspective is a gift that you bring to the world, which the world needs.\n\nAs the graduates lined up to go up on stage to shake some hands, in our hands is a name card, with either future plans, who they are thankful for, and favorite class or memory.\n\nThis was my card.\n\n![Name card](/images/convocation.jpeg)\n\nWhen mine was [announced](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxOKsyjsma_UyJKgzDPckN4iR1FNhdBEhj?si=HNaSK_l-8c1l9ryp) comically, there was an audible laugh from the audience.\n\nI'm not sure if it was phrased in a way that is humorous, or they think I'm naive and young, which I am, but it really motivated me to prove them wrong.\n\nLater that evening was my sister's graduation [ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/gKgOb-iXW8E?si=FiGRqN5IzgKbH1Gp).\n\n![Graduate Ceremony](/images/gradceremony.jpeg)\n\nI was not feeling well and was in pain sitting on those hard plastic seats.\n\nAnd was reading some saved articles on matter with worship songs playing through my airpods pro.\n\nI never really placed any attention on the entire ceremony, but wondered what the colors of the gowns meant for the PhD students. I couldn't figure it out.\n\nI also found it cool that the PhD students had similar gowns as the professors, because the PhD students are doctors now (obviously).\n\nBut when the ceremony came to an end, and everyone gathered with their respective loved ones, it was so wholesome.\n\nI couldn't help but feel every single person's joy, relief, pride, and gratitude to be done with years of researching, iterating, and grinding to finally get to where they are, and to grab photos with family members and friends at the Coliseum.\n\nIt made me think about what my future holds as I venture into graduate school as well. And when it's my turn to graduate, I'll hopefully be in a much better state, physically and mentally.\n",

    "content": "\n![The School of Athens](/images/athens.jpeg)\n\nI had my last ever final paper today at ISU.\n\nHere's a review of all the classes I took during my time here.\n\n### Spring 2021\n\nI started classes at ISU from Malaysia, and I remember one of the labs was at 3 a.m every Wednesday. I had to sleep at 10 a.m. and wake up at 3 for the lab, do a quiz at the end of the lab, and go back to sleep at 5 a.m. I had to do this for a semester. Other classes are all around 11 p.m.\n\n- STAT 341: Introduction to the Theory of Probability and Statistics I\n  - my first statistics class where I was introduced to transformation of random variables, moment generating functions, joint distributions. The class was online, so I would 2x the lecture videos from an indian professor with a heavy accent. The Chinese TA was nice, her lab sessions helped a lot.\n- COM S 227: Object-Oriented Programming\n  - My first ever time touching Java, and unfortunately wasn't my last. I hate Eclipse, horrible software. Labs were fun tho, I can still hear the voice effects of Webex when you get admitted into a room like it was yesterday. It was my first exposure to Zybooks and writing code on a text input area in a lockdown browser. It was stressful times, I remember my laptop crashing during the exam.\n- LD ST 322: Leadership in a Diverse Society\n  - I really liked the positive vibes of the professor, he would have weekly recorded videos, and I learned about things like gender equality, power, privilege, emotional intelligence, and social identities. I also got the chance to interview Dale, a super kind and loving church friend.\n- ENGL 150: Critical Thinking and Communication\n  - lots of writing exercises, wrote about failing my driving test, made a poster about DJI FPV and presented it. It was funny reading my writing from 2 years ago. Realize I did achieve some of the goals I set for myself, and never realized I had that drive and attitude back then.\n\n### Summer 2021\n\n- COM S 228: Introduction to Data Structures\n  - the professor was interesting, he would write in a matrix themed text editor as he taught the class. Learned about inheritance and polymorphism, search, linked list, stacks, trees, maps, hashtables and heaps, and graphs.\n\n### Fall 2021\n\nI flew in to ISU in this semester. Felt really free after being trapped in the house for a year.\n\n- STAT 110: Statistics Orientation\n  - I met some friendly people here. We would have weekly compulsory activities and had to take pictures of ourselves meeting up. Never saw them since the class.\n- STAT 301: Intermediate Statistical Concepts And Methods\n  - This class was standard statistics stuff like regression, anova, hypo test, etc. I had to use JMP, a software for boomers to do statistics. I liked making the two page cheatsheets for the exams. I had to work some americans in a team for the project and labs.\n- STAT 342: Introduction To The Theory Of Probability And Statistics II\n  - This class is supposed to be hard, but the professors made it easy in exams? I remember she gave us back the test papers to \"correct our mistake\" to give us more marks. As someone from Malaysia, this was funny, but also made me realize the quality of education here. It had topics like Method of Moments, MLE, bias and unbiased, factorization theorem, MVUE, sufficient statistics. All these heavy stats concepts. I remember this korean dude that always went to me for answers, and would swear in korean under his breath during the exams.\n- COM S 230: Discrete Computational Structures\n  - this is the most theoretical CS class I had to take for my minor. taught by a former MIT undergrad student. It's basically a math course but for cs. I remember getting a pretty low score in my first exam, which scared me into taking this class more seriously. The logic, proofs, sets, counting and graphs were fine, but relations and set cardinality were hard to grasp. The TA, Jonathan is the hard carry in helping my friends and I get through this course. I have major respect for good TAs.\n- ENGL 250: Written, Oral, Visual, And Electronic Composition\n  - my first ever in person english class experience in the US. It was just me and J who were not americans and white and loud. I felt discriminated in this class, maybe it was just in my head, but it was hard to fit in. I went through my assignments and found that I wrote an interview piece with Harry Styles for his Fine Line album lol. The in-class and outdoors activities were a huge struggle to get out of my comfort zone, but it was a good experience nonetheless.\n- U ST 110 International First Year Seminar\n  - This class is basically meeting up once a week for some activities, talks from ISU staff, one time the police came to talk about safety. I got to give a panel talk this year for this class, full circle.\n\n### Spring 2022\n\nI came back from Malaysia and had a really bad flare up where I couldn't swallow food. I had to apply for a medical reduced course load. So I only took these two classes.\n\n- COM S 311: Introduction To The Design And Analysis Of Algorithms\n  - this class was challenging and fun. Taught me how to think like a computer scientist and learned some important concepts in CS: the sorting and searching algorithms, data structures, graphs, and NP-completeness. I remember working on the HWs with my friends at the library, discussing about the solutions together. I was also surprised that I got good grades in my finals, I remember thinking, \"wait, I did well?\"\n- THTRE 110: Theatre and Society\n  - took this class cause it was required. basically just got answers from a friend for the online quizzes.\n\n### Fall 2022\n\nI came back from California and felt pretty depressed. Really disliked Iowa ever since. I missed the highs in the bay area, the friends, and the energy.\n\n- STAT 471: Introduction to Experimental Design\n  - this class is interesting and relates to experimentation in tech, but it was hard to relate the concepts and fully comprehend them. I felt like I was just getting by. Concepts like subsampling, variance components, interaction, factorial treatment, split plots, blocking. It all felt really agriculture-centric. I wish a CS professor taught me this class.\n- STAT 475: Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis\n  - The chinese professor teaching this class was literally just reading the slides. I could see his inexperience in teaching. I stopped going classes after two weeks. The exams were open book. I remember listening to music on my airpods while taking the test lol.\n- STAT 484: Computer Processing of Scientific Data\n  - I had to learn SAS in this class. A SQL-like and boring language that I'll never have to use ever in my life. Just use Python guys.\n- ENGL 314: Technical Communication\n  - This class is a joke, I got a B+. I wrote a technical document about air fryers and how to make a fruit fly trap. If only ChatGPT came out during this time.\n\n### Spring 2023\n\nI went to Tokyo and then Malaysia, and came back in the cold and depressing land of corn. At this point, I really wanted to get done. I was applying for internships since the previous semester, and wasn't getting anything at all.\n\n- STAT 486: Introduction To Statistical Computing\n  - my research professor taught this class, it's weird to take a class with someone you work with, especially when he knows you skip his class, and says things like \"if you came to my class you would know X or Y\"\n- STAT 474: Introduction To Bayesian Data Analysis\n  - This is the hardest statistics class I took at my time here. I thought it would be fun and interesting, but oh boy was I wrong. I got the lowest in a class of 11 of other grad students in the first exam, and overall a B+. Maybe it was because I barely studied or reviewed the materials, but I felt pretty dumb in this class, like there's a concept that I just couldn't hold in my hands, it kept slipping away like sand. Maybe I had to concentrate my efforts more, be more curious, and hard working.\n- S E 419: Software Tools For Large Scale Data Analysis\n  - took this class for fun because it kinda relates to data engineering, but it taught pretty old stuff, and never liked the professors classes, so I lost interest really quick. I only went to the required labs, which forced me to borrow a windows for school to do the assignments.\n- COM S 472: Principles Of Artificial Intelligence\n  - I had fun with the [programming exercises](https://github.com/benthecoder/othello-ai). Never went to class after the first 2 weeks. studying for midterms and finals just involved 2x speed a few days before, and taking notes on notion.\n\n### Fall 2023\n\nI left this one final class so I could graduate with my sister. Initially I felt like it was bad planning, I could've just graduated in May and went full time at Tesla, but this entire semester was chill and I got to experience things I never did before and do things I enjoy, which I'm grateful about.\n\n- STAT 483: Empirical Methods For The Computational Sciences\n  - This was my last statistics class and I just completely lost interest in statistics. The professor (Kris De Brabanter) was actually nice and enthusiastic, but with the things I went through during this semester, it was just a means to an end. His exams were open notes and easy, so I'm thankful for that.\n\nOverall, was a statistics degree worth it? Am I now a statistician? Do I have more statistics knowledge than an average person? I am not sure. I read through some of the lectures and exams and a lot of those concepts seem remote to me. I couldn't even recognize my own homeworks.\n\nMaybe majoring in software engineering/CS could've given me a better transition into a CS grad degree, and I could've hung out with my friends more in their classes, but hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nI can only move forward, and focus on going into the next stage of my life.\n",

It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do […] Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.\n\nDoesn't intelligence sound great? Isn't \"catching on\" and \"making sense\", and \"figuring out\" all what life is about?\n\nSo intelligent people must live happier lives.\n\nIf they encounter a problem, they can use their superior problem-solving ability to solve them. They should do better jobs at making plans, getting what they want, and learn from their mistakes and make fewer of them.\n\nSo [are smarter people happier](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/why-arent-smart-people-happier?curius=1417)?\n\n[Many](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264815376_Does_Intelligence_Boost_Happiness_Smartness_of_All_Pays_More_Than_Being_Smarter_Than_Others) [studies](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1998-deneve.pdf) [find](https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/s0033291712002139) that either it's no, or only a little bit.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nGenerally, IQ can predict things like how well you do in school and what kind of job you get, but why can't it predict living a life you like?\n\nAll various tests of intelligence are well-defined problems. They can be difficult but they aren't mystical. You can write instructions for solving them, and have indisputable answers.\n\nBut well-defined problems aren't the only kind of problems.\n\n\"Should I go into tech or arts?\", \"Who do I spend my life with\" and \"What do I do when my parents get old\" are not multiple choices questions. These are all important but poorly defined problems.\n\nThere is no good word for the \"skill at solving poorly defined problems\".\n\nInsight, creativity, agency, self-knowledge are all part of it, but not all of it.\n\nWisdom comes closest but it suggest a certain grandeur, and it's not all about asking \"how do you live a good life\". There's also \"how do I figure out what to do today\" and \"how to be a good friend\".\n\nTo spot people who are good at solving poorly defined problems, look for people who feel good about their lives.\n\nBut it's not black and white. What makes me happy might make you miserable. What made you happy in 20s might not make you happy in your 30s.\n\nLife isn't chess, and no one agrees on the rules. The pieces do whatever they want and the board covers the inside of your head and the whole globe.\n\nSome of the smartest people in the world can be endowed with exceptional problem-solving abilities, yet they are unable to solve basic but poorly defined problems like being a good person and not making life-altering mistakes.\n\nIt's time to divide intelligence into well-defined problem-solving and poorly defined problem-solving.\n\nIt shows us that all of AI's progress has only been on defined problems.\n\nIt also reminds us to give respect where respect is due.\n\nPeople who are good at solving well-defined problems are called \"professors\" and \"doctors\" and get paid money and praise. But people good at solving poorly defined problems don't get the same kind of treatment.\n\nYour parents, grandparents, and people who's been on this Earth for decades longer than you know how to raise a good family who love one another, how to carry on through hardships and tragedies, and how to make good food.\n\nIf you don't value their ability in solving poorly defined problems, you'll never get more of it.\n\nYou won't seek out the people who have this ability and try to learn from them, nor will you listen to them when they have something important to say.\n\nYou'll spend your life trying to use intelligence when what you need is wisdom.\n\nYou'll realize that your endless efforts in trying to solve all the well-defined problems will not actually make your life better.\n\nSo listen to your parents for a while and you'll learn something.\n",

Relationships, friendships are complex system.\n\nThey require a balance of different needs, expectations, experiences, and perspectives, and that cannot be achieved through simple, technical solutions.\n\nFriendships are by nature made of friction and involve day-to-day life intricacies.\n\nFriction is not just interrupting your day to help out a friend, but also being vulnerable enough to admit that you need help from them.\n\nWe're living in an illusion of a friction-free life with Amazon prime, Doordash, Instacart, and Tinder, satisfying all our needs, while consuming an endless stream of entertainment.\n\nThis leads to \"[social atrophy](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6YOPdZzZrl8OujI4B3P3TL?si=fdaa493a95bd4ca5)\"\n\nWe're so burned out from our screen-based, data-heavy lives that we no longer have time or energy for the small, mundane, place-based friendships that has nourished and sustained us for centuries.\n\nBut as we face for the major crisis of our time, such as climate change, a [high degree of social trust](https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/where-should-i-live) is needed.

They're [thrown into chaos](https://arc.net/l/quote/ttwnmxzn) by a gust of autumn wind, struggling to hold onto their hats, their possessions fly into the paddy fields, and someone's papers (represents human logic and presumption) are carried off into oblivion.\n\nWhat is art?\n\nFor [Tolstoy](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/09/09/leo-tolstoy-what-is-art-infectiousness/), it's a bridge of empathy between us and others.\n\nFor [Anaïs Nin](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/09/03/anais-nin-on-emotion-and-writing/), it's a way to exorcise our emotional excess.\n\nBut the highest achievement of art is a combination of the two: a channel of empathy into our own psychology that helps us both exercise and better understand our emotions, – in other words, a form of therapy.\n\n[Alain de Botton](https://www.alaindebotton.com/cv/), in [Art as Therapy](https://www.alaindebotton.com/art/), examines art's most intimate purpose: its ability to mediate our psychological shortcomings and assuage our anxieties about imperfection.\n\nArt is not just for aesthetic indulgence, it is a tool that compensates us for inborn weaknesses of the mind.\n\nBelow outlines the [7 psychological functions of art](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/10/25/art-as-therapy-alain-de-botton-john-armstrong/):\n\n1. **Remembering**\n   - we have fear of forgetting – the details about people, places, and all the mundane moments that add up to our existence\n   - \"What we’re worried about forgetting ... tends to be quite particular. It isn’t just anything about a person or scene that’s at stake; we want to remember what really matters, and the people we call good artists are, in part, the ones who appear to have made the right choices about what to communicate and what to leave out\"\n   - \"Art is a way of preserving experiences, of which there are many transient and beautiful examples, and that we need help containing\"\n2. **Hope**\n   - Optimism is a necessary cognitive and psychoemotional skill in our quest to live well.\n   - \"in many cases the difference between success and failure is determined by nothing more than our sense of what is possible and the energy we can muster to convince others of our due. We might be doomed not by a lack of skill, but by an absence of hope\"\n   - \"The more difficult our lives, the more a graceful depiction of a flower might move us. The tears — if they come — are in response not to how sad the image is, but how pretty.\"\n3. **Sorrow**\n   - Art can help us be more whole by not only expanding our capacity for positive emotions, but also fully inhabit and metabolize the negative\n   - \"We can see a great deal of artistic achievement as “sublimated” sorrow on the part of the artist, and in turn, in its reception, on the part of the audience.\"\n   - \"In art, sublimation refers to the psychological processes of transformation, in which base and unimpressive experiences are converted into something noble and fine — exactly what may happen when sorrow meets art\"\n4. **Rebalancing**\n   - we all have imbalances: too complacent, too trusting, too serious, and art can help restore a measure of equilibrium to our inner selves. And it explains the vast diversity of our aesthetic preferences\n   - \"Every work of art is imbued with a particular psychological and moral atmosphere: ... our preferences for one kind over another reflect our varied psychological gaps. We hunger for artworks that will compensate for our inner fragilities and help return us to a viable mean.\"\n   - \"Art can save us time — and save our lives — through opportune and visceral reminders of balance and goodness that we should never presume we know enough about already.\"\n5. **Self-understanding**\n   - despite trying to be self-aware, we are complete mysteries to ourselves, and art can shed light on the least explored parts of our psyche\n   - \"We have intuitions, suspicions, hunches, vague musings, and strangely mixed emotions, all of which resist simple definition. We have moods, but we don’t really know them. Then, from time to time, we encounter works of art that seem to latch on to something we have felt but never recognized clearly before\"\n   - \"a central function of poetry as taking thoughts we experience half-formed and giving them clear expression\"\n6. **Growth**\n   - art expands the boundaries of who we are by helping us overcome the fear of the unfamiliar and live more richly by inviting the unknown\n   - art presents us with \"alien material that provokes defensive boredom and fear, and allows us time and privacy to learn to deal more strategically with it\"\n   - First, acknowledge the strangeness for art that comes with worldviews radically different and contradictory. Second, make ourselves familiar with the minds who created the alien art. Finally, look for points of connections and relate to the personal reality of your own context.\n7. **Appreciation**\n   - habit is a double-edged sword that steals from us a whole range of experiences as we go into autopilot mode. We fail to take note of what is around us, and instead, yearn for some artificial greatness.\n   - Jasper Johns, 'Painted Bronze' (1960) teaches us to look with kinder and more alert eyes at the mundane and familiar.\n   - \"Art can do the opposite of glamorizing the unattainable; it can reawaken us to the genuine merit of life as we’re forced to lead it.\"\n",

They're the ones who you go to for recommendations for movies, restaurants, tech, etc. Or the extra set of eyes to check on your work before you release it to the public.\n\nThe quintessential example of someone with good taste is Isabella Stewart Gardner. She has a [collection](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/experience/collection) of 7500 paintings, sculptures, furniture, textiles, silver, ceramics, 3000 rare books, and 7000 archival objects-from ancient Rome, Medieval Europe, Renaissance Italy, Asia, the Islamic world and 19th-century France and America.\n\nIf you were asked to define taste, what would you say?\n\nSomething along the lines of \"you know it when you see it\" or \"it's in the eye of the beholder\"?\n\nIt's hard to pin down, because they describe a [sensibility](https://newcriterion.com/issues/1998/2/the-new-sensibility) more than any particular quality, a particular thing.\n\nIt's an ability or sensitivity to appreciate and respond to aesthetic influences.\n\nSome notes on \"taste\" on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/blog/notes-on-taste).\n\n- Taste is a mode, it's a manner of interpretation, expression or action.\n  - Things don't feel tasteful, they demonstrate taste. (i.e. you can dress tastefully but an experience cannot be tasteful)\n- **appreciation and creation** are forms of taste, but they don't have to be intertwined.\n  - You can have impeccable taste in art without producing any, but those who create tasteful things are almost always deep appreciators.\n  - creating forces taste upon it's maker, they must master self-expression and craft to make something truly compelling\n- we talk about taste in binaries, either you have it or not. great taste means almost the same as taste\n- Having taste requires intention, focus, and care. It's a commitment to a state of attention, you can't have taste by mistake\n- Taste comes in lanes: there is taste in people, visual, emotion, acts, and intelligence (taste in ideas). Taste tends to develop unevenly.\n- Taste is often formed through the integration of diverse, wide-ranging inputs.\n  - Steve Jobs said, \"I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.\"\n- John Folley: \"Good taste is simply to have a well formed opinion, in accordance to the realities of the Good and the True\". There are tasteful and non-tasteful choices.\n- Taste is not the same as correctness. Taste intrigues, compels, moves, enchants, fascinates, and seduces.\n- Taste requires originality, it invokes aspirational authenticity (i.e. writing stories that only ou can write, to be joyfully and defiantly yourself)\n- Taste honors someone's standard of quality, but also the distinctive way the world bounces off a person. It reflects what they know about how the world works, and what they're working with in their inner worlds.\n- By turning the chaotic and overwhelming pool of information into a steady stream of things we find beautiful, we can define and cultivate our tastes.\n- There are no shortcuts to taste. Take your time learning what you find compelling, and why.\n- Susan Sontag: “taste has no system and no proofs. But there is something like a logic of taste: the consistent sensibility which underlies and gives rise to a certain taste\n",

Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind\n   - cultivate capacity for [negative capability](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/11/01/john-keats-on-negative-capability/), the ability to embrace uncertainty\n   - it's more rewarding to understand than to be right\n2. Do nothing for prestige or status or money or approval\n   - \"prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. it causes you to work on not what you like, but what you'd like to like\" - [PG](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/02/27/purpose-work-love/)\n3. Be generous\n   - with your time, resources, giving credit, and with your words.\n   - to understand and be understood are among life's greatest gifts, every interaction is an opportunity to exchange them\n4. Build pockets of **stillness** into your life\n   - meditate, go for walks, [daydream](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/10/09/mind-wandering-and-creativity/), overdose on [boredom](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/10/26/susan-sontag-on-boredom/)\n   - be religious and disciplined about your sleep, it [regulates negative emotion](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/13/the-twenty-four-hour-mind-rosalind-cartwright/)\n5. You are the only custodian of your own integrity\n   - [Maya Angelou](https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/maya-angelou/): \"When people tell you who they are, believe them. But when people try to tell you who you are, don't believe them.\n6. Presence > productivity\n   - [Annie Dillard](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/06/07/annie-dillard-the-writing-life-1/): \"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives\"\n   - productivity robs us of the capacity for joy and wonder that makes life worth living\n7. Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time – [Debbie Millman](https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/debbie-millman/)\n   - it's something fundamental and impatiently overlooked in our culture of immediacy\n   - overnight success is a myth, our present definition of success needs to be [redefined](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/07/12/thoreau-on-success/).\n8. Seek out what magnifies your spirit – [Patti Smith](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/19/patti-smith-m-train-loss-time/)\n   - who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them and hold on to them\n9. Don't be afraid to be an idealist\n   - choose to innovate and uplift rather than catering to existing commercial demands (optimizing for virality)\n   - create content that lifts and educates society (E.B. White), shift demand from superficial to meaningful, enriching collective cultural experience\n10. Don't just **resist cynicism** – fight it actively\n    - cynicism is uncreative, unconstructive and spiritually corrosive\n    - live with sincerity and act from a place of constructive, rational faith in the human spirit\n11. Question your maps and models of the universe\n    - continually test them against the raw input of reality, our maps are still maps, just approximations of truth, our incomplete representational models always leave more to map\n12. There are infinitely [many kinds](https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/01/figuring/) of beautiful lives\n13. Forgive, forgive, forgive\n    - the richest relationships are lifeboats, but also submarines that descend into the most unfathomed trenches of the soul where our deepest shames and vulnerabilities live\n    - \"forgiveness is the alchemy by which shame transforms into honor and privilege of being invited into another's darkness and having them witness your own with the undimmed light of love, of sympathy, of nonjudgemental understanding\"\n14. <mark>Choose Joy</mark>\n    - if [Viktor Frankl](https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/17/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-viktor-frankl/) can exclaim \"yes to life, in spite of everything!\", any one of us can\n    - Joy is not a function of life free of friction and frustration, but a function of focus\n    - Herman Hesse: \"the [little joys](https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/03/06/hermann-hesse-little-joys-my-belief/)\" are the slender threads which we weave the lifeline that saves us in a world full of chaos\n15. Outgrow yourself\n    - [Joan Didion](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/11/19/joan-didion-on-keeping-a-notebook/): “we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not,”\n16. [Unself](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/10/unselfing-social/)\n    - we're living through a pandemic of selfing – rampant self-celebration mistaking applause for connection and likes for love\n    - self-concern is the antipode of wonder.\n",

In each event, I would meet new people, practice my social skills, and get inspired by the speakers and other attendees. I remember it feeling surreal how all these people who I read about on the internet, were in the same room as me.\n\nAs someone who's organized events (on a smaller scale), it's interesting to be on the other side. You see all the work that have to go into it, the logistics and the planning.\n\nIn ISU, I started [GDSC](https://gdsc.community.dev/iowa-state-university/) to build a community of developers who wanted to learn from each other. It was challenging finding people who shared the same passion as me. Maybe it has something to do with me being in Iowa. Also, starting a new club was difficult considering it took an entire semester to get it approved, and having Google's name in the club confuses but also attracts people.\n\nSome lessons I've learned organizing events for students:\n\n- be able to introduce your club in 30 seconds, it should clearly define why you're different from existing clubs\n- organize a wide variety of events, people will show up\n- for every event, think about what the students can takeaway from\n- good design and branding is important, especially since we're representing Google\n- utilize professors to reach out to students\n- the date and time matters, don't clash with other big events\n- have a list of event ideas ready to go\n- reach out to speakers on twitter, linkedin, people are willing to talk\n- create a event checklist to reuse, to streamline tasks for everyone\n\nDave has a lot more experience, 5 years of running a tech meetup.\n\nHere's his [12 lessons](https://davekiss.com/blog/12-lessons-from-5-years-of-running-a-tech-meetup):\n\n1. The **space** where you host matters: great lighting, noise level, comfy seating\n2. <mark>You're selling an experience that doesn't exist yet</mark>: Posters and graphics should paint a picture of the event, show pictures of prior events\n3. **Over-communicate** the event logistics and agenda: you can't provide too much information, create a description template for events, and slideshow for intro\n4. Seek out the most **interesting stories**: Find people who will make you excited to attend the event yourself\n5. Find reliable, recurring **sponsors**: find tech companies, negotiate a longer term slot (3-event package), communicate back summary of how event went, anything to help justify their spend, find companies willing to rent space for free\n6. Order **less food** than you think you need: 30% dropoff for all RSVPs, cover 80% of predicted attendance\n7. Leave blocks of **social time**: the real value of meetups, leave time before and after\n8. Two attendees is a meetup: all it takes is another person to show up besides you\n9. Ask for feedback, reviews, and **testimonials**: social proof helps, be explicit and ask for feedback, quote testimonials\n10. Keep the **momentum** going: tease future events, send reminder emails, have events planned months out\n11. **Know your reasons** for organizing a meetup: it can turn into work really fast, so focus on the people, the stories and experiences you want to create\n12. It takes a leader: Assign specific duties to people willing to help\n",

It is contrasted with [learned helplessness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326).\n\n### 3 components of optimism\n\n1. Permanence: is this bad thing forever?\n   - pessimist: this will never end\n   - optimist: this is temporary, it will pass\n2. Pervasiveness: is this problem global?\n   - pessimist: this is the worst, my life is over\n   - optimist: not everything is bad, finds silver lining\n3. Personalization: is this problem personal?\n   - pessimist: it's all me, I'll never be good enough\n   - optimist: this isn't my fault, I can't control everything\n\n### Why optimism is good\n\nThere are many [benefits](https://positivepsychology.com/learned-optimism/#research) to optimism.\n\n- lower heart problems\n- live longer\n- more motivated and successful\n- more effective at decision making\n- higher rates of well being and lower rates of depression\n\nThe opposite of optimism is depression, the cognitive triad of depression is negative thoughts about **yourself**, **other people**, and the **future**.\n\nDepression causes pessimistic thinking, and you feel like this is just how the world is. You feel like you can't change anything, and you're stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. This is depression talking, it's not reality.\n\n### How to be more optimistic\n\nTHe ABCDE technique.\n\n- A: **Adversity** (the stressful situation)\n  - Being diagnosed with a chronic illness.\n- B: **Belief** (what you think about it)\n  - \"This illness will ruin my life. I won't be able to do things I love.\"\n- C: **Consequence** (what happens as a result of your belief)\n  - Feeling hopeless and depressed\n  - withdrawing from social activities\n  - rejecting treatment and support\n- D: **Dispute** (challenge your pessimism)\n  - Recognize that the illness is a challenge, not an end to everything enjoyable.\n  - Understand that many people live fulfilling lives despite chronic illnesses.\n  - Reflect on past challenges overcome successfully.\n  - Replace the belief with \"This illness is a part of my life, but it doesn't define me.\"\n- E: **Energization** (how it energizes you)\n  - Feeling empowered to explore treatment options.\n  - Engaging in activities adapted to new limitations.\n  - Seeking support from healthcare professionals, friends, and support groups.\n  - Focusing on what can be done rather than limitations.\n\n### Toxic positivity\n\nToxic positivity is denying or ignoring negative aspect sof life.\n\nHealthy optimism acknowledges the negative, but chooses to focus on the potential positive and opportunities for growth.\n",

Make sure you do nothing successfully. Only then should you make changes so it starts doing something.\n\nThis iterative way of programming will allow you to know that any problems you have are related to your attempts to do something.\n\nHere's an example to drive the point home\n\n### Step 0: Inserting data\n\n```py\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef insert_data_into_db(data):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data (info TEXT)''')\n    c.execute('''INSERT INTO data (info) VALUES (?)''', (data,))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\ninsert_data_into_db('Sample Data')\n```\n\n### Step 1: Basic FastAPI with no operations\n\n```py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post('/data')\ndef handle_data():\n    return {\"message\": \"Endpoint Created\"}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Register an action\n\n```py\n@app.post('/data')\ndef handle_data():\n    print(\"Yay! Received a request.\")\n    return {\"message\": \"Endpoint Hit\"}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Parse response and check output\n\n```py\n@app.post('/data')\nasync def handle_data(request: Request):\n    data = await request.json()\n    print(f\"Received data: {data}\")\n    return {\"message\": \"Data Received\"}s\n```\n\n### Step 4: Perform the action\n\n```py\n@app.post('/data')\nasync def handle_data(request: Request):\n    data = await request.json()\n    insert_data_into_db(str(data))\n    return {\"message\": \"Data Processed and Stored in DB\"}\n```\n",

Slow systems starve.\n\nWorking quickly is important: you'll finish more stuff per unit time.\n\nIf you work quickly, the cost of doing something new also seems lower in your mind.\n\nThis makes you inclined to do more.\n\nExamples of this:\n\n- Sending emails: if you respond quickly, people send more emails because they expect a fast response, the projected cost of the exchange is low\n- Web search: Google prioritized speed as a feature, no delay between thought and action, encourages you to search\n- Work: faster employees get assigned more work\n- Business: Customers find out you're slow, go to other business\n\nWhat does that mean for you?\n\nIf you're starting any task, the activation energy required comes how much effort you believe it'll take in your head. If it feels costly, you'll need a bigger expenditure.\n\nIf you're slow in completing a task, this additional cost accrues, when you think of doing that task again, you see the cost, and you bail.\n\nSo <mark>push yourself to go faster</mark> than you think is healthy, so that the task will cost less in your mind, it'll have lower activation energy, and you'll do it more.\n\nAs you do it more (deliberately), you'll get better.\n\nThen, you'll be both fast and good.\n\nSo, [speed matters](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters).\n",

    "content": "\nA paper on [how to read papers](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).\n\nReading papers is an untaught skill.\n\nThis paper introduces a \"three-pass approach\"\n\n### 1. The First Pass: What's the idea? (5-10 mins)\n\nThis quick scan helps to get a general understanding of the paper and decide if further reading is necessary. It involves:\n\n- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.\n- Read section and sub-section headings, ignore everything else\n- Read the conclusions\n- Glance over the references\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should identify five Cs:\n\n1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?\n2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?\n3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?\n4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?\n5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?\n\n### 2. The Second Pass: Grasps the content (~ 1 hour)\n\nIn this stage, read the paper more carefully but skip over details like proofs:\n\n- Examine figures and diagrams closely. Pay special attentions to graphs\n- Take notes and mark important references for future reading.\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should be able to:\n\n- grasp content of paper\n- summarize main thrust of paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else\n\nIf you don't understand it, either it is a new subject matter, an experimental technique, or it's poorly written\n\n### 3. The Third Pass: Go in depth, re-implement (4-5 hours)\n\nThis is an in-depth reading where you try to understand the paper at a deeper level and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- implement the paper: make the same assumptions as the authors and re-create the work\n- identify and challenge every assumption in every statement\n- compare yours and the actual paper, identify the paper's innovation and hidden failings and assumptions.\n- jot down ideas for future work\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should be able to:\n\n- reconstruct the entire structure of paper from memory\n- Identify its strong and weak points\n- pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with the techniques\n\n### Guidelines for reading\n\n- Read critically\n  - don't assume authors are always correct, ask appropriate questions\n- Read creatively\n  - what are the good ideas in this paper?\n  - Do the ideas have other applications or extensions?\n  - are there possible improvements\n  - what would be the next thing you would do?\n  - Do one pass on each paper\n- Make notes as you read\n\n### Doing a Literature Survey\n\nWhen conducting a literature survey, the three-pass approach is valuable:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Use academic search engines with specific keywords to find initial papers and read their related work sections.\n2. **Identifying Key Papers**: Look for shared citations and author names in these papers to find key research in the area.\n3. **Exploring Conference Proceedings**: Visit top conference websites in the field and browse their proceedings for recent high-quality work.\n\nThrough this method, you can efficiently conduct a literature survey by identifying and understanding the most relevant papers in a field.\n",

It felt like I got invited to a wealthy person's house to explore in their library. It's cozy and inviting, and overall I felt good being in there. If I lived in Boston, I would come here everyday if I had the chance.\n\nIt was time for dim sum, we walked through Boston Common, and got to Winsor Dim Sum Cafe.\n\nThis spot was great. The food came fast. The dim sum was good. What more can you ask?\n\nTt was time for the two popular museums.\n\nWe took the subway and I saw Northeaster University through the window.\n\nI wanted to go to [Isabella Stewart Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner?useskin=vector) Museum for the really aesthetic garden, but I ended up really liking the artworks. There were 3 floors and multiple rooms, each telling their own story about Isabella's [life](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/about/isabella-stewart-gardner).\n\nI got tired after going through all the rooms and me and A decided to sketch. I sat down and saw a couple sitting in front of me on their phones with the garden in the background. I have trouble drawing hands. Sketching is pretty fun.\n\nWe went to Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) next. The funny thing is when we found out tickets were 27, we were like nope. And wanted to get out of line, but ended up already getting in the Museum. So we decided to just look around, and the deeper we went the more guilt A felt. As my guilty conscience began to grow as well, after seeing the Monet paintings, I only wanted to see Hokusai and leave. But it was such a huge museum, that navigating to the Asian art section took 20 minutes. And when I did find it, it was \"Coming soon\". We left to the gift store and I bought some items with the Great Wave on them.\n\nLeaving MFA, it was already night.\n\nWe walked to Berklee College of Music, but entry was only for students.\n\nWe went to Prudential center next. We explored around Eataly, I bought some italian chocolates.\n\nThere was nothing else to see there, so we went for the public library, but it was closed.\n\nWe rested at the Capital One Cafe, and decided to go Chinatown for claypot. But on the way there, an all-you-can-eat sushi place caught A's attention. We decided to eat here instead. I love Eel sushi. The tofu was also super silky and smooth. Edamame is crunchy. We had a good time. I notice again how we're quiet and other tables are really loud, especially the groups with all guys. A observed that waiters/waitresses in Boston are not very friendly.\n\nWe walked home from the Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe finished Identity, watched an explainer video on YouTube, then an episode of Naruto to end our day on a lighter tone.\n\nMy eyes were burning.\n\nWe slept at 1:24 a.m.\n",

Harvard Museum of Natural History ($10 for students, takes an hour min)\n   1. Harvard Museum of Ancient Near East (close by, 3 floors of Eastern civilization artifacts)\n2. Science center (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments)\n3. Memorial Hall\n4. Gund hall (Druker Design Gallery)\n5. John Harvard Statue\n6. Widener Library (Harvard ID required)\n7. Harvard Art Museum (Free admission, an hour min as well)\n8. Harvard Square\n9. Harvard book store\n\nGet lunch nearby, we went to Hokkaido Ramen. I'd give it a 8/10, +1 because it was a cold day and the broth warmed us up.\n\n### MIT\n\nGet here around 3 p.m.\n\n1. Great Dome (grab a picture here)\n2. Stata Center\n3. MIT Science Museum (closes at 5, so get here around 3:15?)\n\nAfter the museum, you can cross the Harvard Bridge to Newbury Street for shopping and dinner.\n\n### Newbury Street\n\nSome places we went\n\n- UNIQLO\n- Muji\n- TJ Maxx.\n- Anime Zakka\n- Trident Booksellers & Cafe\n- DeLuca's Market\n\n### Some thoughts\n\nOverall, I found Harvard a more interesting place to explore than MIT, it might have something to do with us getting to MIT Great Dome at 4:20 p.m., and we were losing daylight, and we didn't get to go to the museum which closes at 5 p.m. I was blamed by A for spending too much time at the bookstore.\n\nThe Natural History museum was fun, it had glass flowers, pretty rocks, lifelike mammals around the world, insects, birds, fossils, and more. Connected to it was the Peabody Museum of Archeology & Ethnology, one of the world's oldest anthropology museum. You could see Maya monuments, artifacts by Native American communities, objects traded by 18th century Boston ship captains.\n\nThe Art museum was really nice as well, although we spent ~45 min speedrunning the place because we wanted to be on time for MIT. Maybe that's not such a good strategy for museums, instead of maximizing your surface area, and catching an eye of every painting and artwork, you're supposed to slow down, observe it from all angles, notice what feelings geyser up from inside you, whether positive or negative, or just enjoy the work of artists who poured their heart and soul, taking the leap to pursue their artistic passion, materializing their past experiences, their innovative, unconventional ideas, into something physical, something visceral.\n\nThe Harvard book store, specifically the used section below ground, was kind of a let down, I didn't find any good books there. The new books were expensive and well, new. I'm feel strongly against buying new books nowadays, it feels weird. I'd rather buy a book that someone else used to leave at their coffee table to show off to their guests that they're book readers, folded in their hands burning under the sun while they read in the balcony, or books that sat in someone's shelf collecting dusts until the owners decided that it could be in better hands.\n\nThe Great dome was cool, I never knew what was inside, and now I do. It was classrooms, research labs, lecture halls, study spaces, etc. The interesting thing about MIT that A observed is all the buildings are connected really well. You could possible get from class to your dorm barely even stepping foot outside.\n\nNewbury street is a great way to end the day. There are tons of shops and food places here. Also right by Prudential Center, which houses Eataly.\n",

And talked about how he goes back to Texas frequently, that he paid $600 for a ticket back during Christmas.\n\nI took a nap in the flight to Chicago.\n\nArriving at O'Hare, we bought sandwiches at a bakery. I got a turkey and bacon sandwich and got heartburn from it.\n\nOn the flight to Boston, I read [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/), specifically the chapter on Linear Algebra, I got anxiety flashbacks to my class in INTI with Ms. S when I saw The words \"[row echolon form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form?useskin=vector)\". I realized it was too theoretical and I probably will forget everything I read next week, so I decided to practice Python with [The Elements of Programming](https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge/tree/master/epi_judge_python).\n\nArriving in Boston, we were full of excitement and positive anticipation.\n\nOur first reaction when leaving the gate was how cold it was, mostly because of the wind.\n\nOur first hiccup was getting to James Hook & Co.\n\nPro tip: if you're arriving at Boston Logan Airport. The Uber will arrive at the departure, not baggage pickup, so go up one floor. Also the cars will not arrive at the first road, you have to cross the road into the garage, and they'll stop at numbered locations.\n\nAfter getting cancelled the first time, we were brought to South Boston Waterfront instead of downtown, and had to order another ride to get there.\n\nI no longer will use Uber for this entire trip, unless necessary.\n\nWe got the infamous lobster roll, and A said this was one of the best spots.\n\nIt was $40 for a good amount of lobster meat and bread. I found it to be chewy at first, but grew to like it.\n\nAfter that was getting to our Airbnb.\n\nIn the city, either the GPS is buggy because of the buildings, or Boston roads are just weird. It was hard to get around.\n\nWe stopped by the Rowes wharf and saw the sunset. The arch made it feel like I was staring at a painting.\n\nIt was nice to walk in a city again, there was so much stimuli in every direction, after being in Ames for months, seeing the city feels like you've entered society again.\n\nOnce we found our Airbnb, a middle aged white man with a beanie stopped and asked us for butane. We were so confused.\n\nWe left after warming up and settling in, and went for Quincy Market.\n\nI had high expectations for this place to be super crowded and Christmasy for some reason, but it was just a indoor marketplace with food and desserts, and then some shops outside. The entire area was pretty dead.\n\nWe were cold and disappointed, and went back to Chinatown.\n\nWe walked around and came across Hong Kong eatery, which was on our list.\n\nWe went in and ordered some takeaway. Some were standing and others were sitting at the small tables and chairs, with Jay Chou was playing on the small tv on the wall. The restaurant was small but cozy.\n\nI got fish porridge, which reminded me of Malaysia.\n\nWhile waiting for our orders, we went around the multitudes of bakeries around, all selling similar pastries, mooncakes, and buns but with their own unique touch and branding.\n\nI saw so many chinese people while walking around and exploring. Always nice to be surrounded by people like you, makes it feel like I'm home.\n\nWe took our order and walked back to our airbnb.\n\nAte the food and talked about our day.\n\nPlanned the spots to hit in Harvard and MIT the next day.\n\nWatched a bit of the movie Identity cause it just came up in our conversations.\n\nSlept at 12 and looked forward to the exciting day in store of us.\n",

(ex: playback control is a nearby element compared to screen)\n   - reinforce depth with lighting and shadows to appear realistic (ex: screen shines light onto nearby objects, objects casts shadows, grounding them)\n   - prefer subtle depths, (ex: use for contrasting modals)\n   - explore small and large scale (ex: movies should be large and impressive, shopping products should be real-life scale)\n4. **Immersive**\n   - immersion spectrum: from shared spaces to full spaces, can take people to new places, or still show their surroundings\n   - guide focus to avoid overwhelming people\n   - blend thoughtfully with surroundings using soft edges, lighting, shadows. Anchor content\n   - add liveliness with subtle animation (water rippling and clouds)\n   - create atmosphere with spatial audio\n   - avoid large fast movements, fade out content when moving, and back in when settled\n   - provide clear entry and exit to immersive experience with recognizable icons like expand/collapse arrows\n5. **Authentic**\n   - Identify key interactions, perspectives or moments that can be experienced spatially (ex: viewing panorama, seeing pictures at real-life scale) with rich visuals and high-fidelity audio, make things feel real.\n   - Make use of space and immersion for creativity, focus, or evoking feelings\n\nThe video shows a lot of cool examples for these concepts.\n\nI can't wait for the day where I own a [Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), and interact with the web in a completely different way.\n",

I also realize I don't understand Linear Algebra at all. Like why does the no. of cols in A have to match the no. of rows in B for a [matmul](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Matrix_multiplication) operation?\n\nNow that I'm starting grad school, and have the goal of becoming an AI engineer, it's time to **really** understand LA.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeDTwWcnuY&t=19s) today taught by the amazing [Charles Frye](https://charlesfrye.github.io/about/), who was also involved in teaching [FSDL](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/).\n\nHe also made videos for calculus and probability in his series [Math4ML](http://wandb.me/m4ml-videos), along with [exercise notebooks](https://github.com/wandb/edu/tree/main/math-for-ml).\n\nHis [analogy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kqf3cq2lvJ8QtunduVtaTCVfFUq574faOC-Sx6yQEK8/edit#slide=id.g7270120a71_1_214) of comparing linear algebra with programming really helped me make sense of the how and the why behind it.\n\nHere are some takeaways.\n\n- LA is like programming\n  - in programming, we combine **functions** with matching **types** through **function composition**\n  - in LA, we combine **matrices** with matching **shapes** through **matrix multiplication**\n  - so, think of matrices as functions, and matmul as a function application, that takes another matrix\n- why arrays as functions?\n  - easy to change slightly, small changes to entries -> small changes to function\n  - LA can be made lightning fast ([TPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit), [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprogramsr))\n  - arrays represent [linear functions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linear_function)\n  - linear functions play nice with weighted sums\n  - this makes linear function easy to reason about\n    - ex: 0 is **always** sent to 0\n    - **everything sent to 0** is called the **[kernel](https://brilliant.org/wiki/kernel/)**\n      - kernel is made of weighted sums\n    - weighted sums define the [rank](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-rank.html) of function\n      - We can make **new non-kernel elements** by making **weighted sums of known non-kernel elements**.\n      - Rank answers the question: **how many non-kernel elements** do I need to know in order to **make every element that’s not in the kernel**?\n- [SVD](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Singular_value_decomposition) is matrix \"refactoring\"\n  - \"separation of concern\" = Eigenvectors (\"eigendecomposition\")\n  - removing redundant code = Low-rank decomposition\n  - break up into functions (decomposing) = Singular Value decomposition (SVD)\n- Function & Matrix decomposition\n  - any function can be decomposed to \"**representatives**\", reversible **renaming**, and **type conversion**\n  - any matrix can be decomposed into A (tall matrix), B (square matrix), C (wide matrix)\n  - in SVD, special choices are made: B is diagonal, and A and C are unitary (no growing/shrinking)\n- why do SVD?\n  - calculate low-rank approximation\n  - used in PCa for preprocessing and analyzing data\n  - classify and measure matrices in LA\n- applied to video\n  - many matrices are nearly low rank (you can notice patterns)\n    - full rank = absence of patterns in matrix\n  - simplest low-rank pattern in a video is the background\n    - an outer product of a vector \\* rest of vectors (a repeat() function)\n    - think of it as an approximation\n    - used to compress data (this is used in JPEG encoding of images in form of Fourier transform)\n    - can be used to separate out foreground. Rank 1 approx is the background, and you can use it to approx foreground.\n\n### LA concepts\n\n- matrix: a function that transforms data\n- matmul: applying a function to an input\n- rank: count of unique, independent features in data\n  - low rank : repeating patterns, useful for compressing data\n  - full rank: implies complex data\n- kernel: a function that returns zero for specific inputs, helps identify redundant or dependent features in data\n- eigenvectors: directions in which data varies the most\n- SVD: decompose function into simpler parts\n  - Surjective (onto): Every possible output is represented.\n  - Bijective (one-to-one and onto): Each input has a unique output and vice versa.\n  - Injective (one-to-one): Every input leads to a unique output.\n\n### More Resources\n\nHackers approach\n\n- [Computational Linear Algebra for Coders](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra)\n- [Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)\n\nVisualize\n\n- [Graphical Linear Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/04/23/makelele-and-linear-algebra/) – a new way of doing LA\n- [Essence of linear algebra by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) – amazing animations, visualize concepts\n\nPapers/Courses/Textbooks\n\n- [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdf)\n- [Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)\n- [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-41026-0.pdf)\n",

    "content": "\nIn my past 2 years of programming with Python and React in various little hackathon projects and side projects like this blog, I've never really worked much with pull requests or creating branches. I've just been pushing to the main branch.\n\nI'm now working on a hackathon and would like to practice creating branches, writing [good commit messages](https://bneo.xyz/posts/code-pr), merging branches, etc.\n\nI found this [Git Style Guide](https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#messages) inspired by inspired by [How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html), and the [git man pages](http://git-scm.com/doc)\n\n### Branches\n\n- use lower case in [branch names](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/collaborate-and-share-your-work/use-github/naming-git-branches/), use hyphens to separate words\n- choose short descriptive names like \"oauth-migration\", not \"login_fix\" (too vague)\n- use identifiers from tickets like `git checkout -b issue-15`\n- delete branch from upstream repo after merging, unless there's good reason not to\n- use `git branch --merged | grep -v \"\\*\"` to list merged branches.\n- [more tips](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848)\n\n### Commits\n\n- when writing, **think about what you would need to know in a year from now** when running across the commit\n- each commit should be a single _logical_ change, ex: if a patch fixes a bug and optimize performance, split into two\n- use `git add -p` to interactively stage specific portions of files\n- don't split a single _logical_ change into several commits (features + tests should be one)\n- <mark>commit early and often</mark> : small, self-contained commits are easier to understand and easy to revert\n- commits should be **ordered logically**, if commit X depends on Y, Y should come before X.\n- [squash](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash) commits using `--squash` and `-fixup`\n\n### Messages\n\n- summary line should be descriptive yet succinct, no longer than 50 chars\n- should not end with a period\n- after that comes a blank line and a more thorough description (72 chars) explaining **why** the change was needed, **how** it addresses the issue, and **what side-effects** it might have\n- it should also provide pointers to related resources (link to issue in bug tracker)\n- if commit A depends on B, state in message of A, and use SHA1 to refer to commits\n\n```txt\nShort (50 chars or fewer) summary of changes\n\nMore detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to\n72 characters. In some contexts, the first\nline is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of\nthe text as the body.  The blank line separating the\nsummary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body\nentirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run\nthe two together.\n\nFurther paragraphs come after blank lines.\n\n- Bullet points are okay, too\n\n- Use a hyphen or an asterisk for the bullet,\n  followed by a single space, with blank lines in\n  between\n\nThe pointers to your related resources can serve as a footer\nfor your commit message. Here is an example that is referencing\nissues in a bug tracker:\n\nResolves: #56, #78\nSee also: #12, #34\n\nSource: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n```\n\n### Merging\n\n- **Do not rewrite published history**\n- keep history clean and simple, before merging\n  - make sure it conforms to style guide, perform actions if it doesn't (squash/reorder, reword messages)\n  - rebase onto branch, so it can be applied directly to end of \"main\" branch and result in a simple history (suited for projects with short-running branches)\n- If your branch includes more than one commit, do not merge with a [fast-forward](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29673993):\n  - `git merge --no-ff my-branch`\n\n### Extras\n\nSome maintenance tasks git commands\n\n- [git gc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc)\n- [git prune](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-prune)\n- [git fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck)\n\n### More Git stuff\n\nSome articles by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)\n\n- [Confusing git terminology](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/01/confusing-git-terminology/)\n- [Some miscellaneous git facts](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/10/20/some-miscellaneous-git-facts/)\n- [In a git repository, where do your files live?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/)\n- [git rebase: what can go wrong?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/06/rebasing-what-can-go-wrong-/)\n- [How git cherry-pick and revert use 3-way merge](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/10/how-cherry-pick-and-revert-work/)\n",

Create an End-to-end pipeline\n\n- Create a very simple pipeline of reading in data, creating features, training a (simple) model, and computing the **competition-specific metric**\n- replicate as closely as possible to the [validation](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-kaggle-book/9781801817479/Text/Chapter_6.xhtml#_idParaDest-95) setup for leaderboard\n\n### 2. Experiment and research\n\n- start with a simple model and iterate through many ideas\n- read research papers, check other comps\n- look at data, even external data, reduce noise, augment the data\n- use different losses\n- post-process the predictions\n- more experimentation = better, evaluate them with validation setup\n\n### 3. Scale your approach\n\n- now you've converged on a final model, and are no longer experimenting\n- it's time to use all of the data and \"scale up\" the model\n- this means hyperparameter turning, using a deeper model, etc.\n- happens at the last 2-3 weeks of comp\n\n### Summary\n\n> Pick something that motivates you. First goal: create a feedback loop that allows you to experiment. Then experiment.

    "content": "\nWhen you read code and find it hard to understand, you're experiencing [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load).\n\nCognitive Load = amount of mental effort to complete a task.\n\nWhile reading code, you have to keep in mind information such as conditional logic, data structure state, loop indices, variable values, etc. And since people can typically hold only 5-7 pieces of information in their [short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Capacity), code that is more complex (involves more information) increases cognitive load.\n\nCognitive load is also higher for other people reading the code you wrote. This is why [code reviews](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html#complexity) are needed, to check if the code causes too much cognitive load.\n\nSo, be kind to your coworkers and write clean code.\n\nThe key to reducing cognitive load is to make code simpler.\n\nHere are some principles:\n\n1. **Limit amount of code in a function or file**: [Keep functions small](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html) and limit each class to [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).\n2. **Create abstractions to hide implementation details**: functions and interfaces are [abstraction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs211/2006sp/Lectures/L08-Abstraction/08_abstraction.html) to hide complex details, but don't go overboard.\n3. **Simplify control flow**: too many if statements or loops makes the [control flow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/simplify-your-control-flows.html) hard to understand, hide complex logic with helper functions. Reduce [nesting](https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/06/code-health-reduce-nesting-reduce.html) with early returns.\n4. **Minimize mutable state**: [stateless](https://stackoverflow.com/a/844548) code is easier to understand, avoid mutable class fields, make types [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)\n5. **Include only relevant details in a test**: test can be [hard to follow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/include-only-relevant-details-in-tests.html) if it includes boilerplate test data that is irrelevant\n6. **Don't overuse mocks in tests**: [improper use of mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/05/testing-on-toilet-dont-overuse-mocks.html) -> cluttered test with calls that expose implementation details\n\nHere's a [printer friendly version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgcBG2iOmzEWIKYs6hNDyTMZ-an0SOwmJZRsX898XD0/edit?pli=1).\n",

    "content": "\nWe possess a fundamental concept of self. We are aware of our names, our parents, and the milestones of our lives, such as our successes and failures. However, truly grasping our self-concept extends well beyond the mere facts of our personal history.\n\nSelf-concept is deeply intertwined with our self-esteem. It reflects in our belief in our capabilities to overcome challenges, to contribute positively to our world, and in our capacity for self-transformation. These aspects of self-concept are influenced by personal history, but according to Dr. Paul Conti, an individual can enhance their **agency** and ability to achieve goals through a deeper understanding of their self-concept.\n\n### How do we achieve this deeper understanding?\n\nOne effective method is to consciously and deliberately construct a [life narrative](https://youtu.be/CJIXbibQ0jI?si=mtY8J3gJ91xo_4Nb&t=5214).\n\n### What is a Life Narrative?\n\nThe process involves dividing your life into 3-5 year segments. Within these periods, note down in bullet points the life events that seem significant to you. This could encompass hobbies, work experiences, pivotal relationships, personal challenges, or anything else that stands out in your memory. These events could be either positive or negative, or even neutral experiences that continue to resonate with you.\n\n### What to include?\n\nIt's crucial to include moments that you fear you might forget, moments that you believe define you. The aim isn't to draft a seamless life story, but to create a collage of vital personal experiences.\n\n### Developing a Historical Sense of Self\n\nBy documenting these life segments, you cultivate a historical sense of self, which contributes to your understanding of your past, present, and potentially, your future. This historical sense grounds you in the flow of time and reveals the extent of your commitment to various pursuits at different stages of your life.\n\n### Recognizing Patterns\n\nThis narrative can illuminate persistent patterns in your work or relationships, helping you discern whether these patterns are beneficial. It's not about setting goals; it's about discerning a structured pattern in your narrative.\n\n### Am I on the right path?\n\nBy reviewing your life narrative, you can evaluate if you're on the course you desire. It helps you understand the journey that has led you to where you are today.\n",

More machine learning fundamentals interviews (things like logistic regression, probability fundamentals, vector calculus, and math puzzles).\n- The **robotics engineer** interviews: fun systems questions. extremely specific to robotics, less time talking about ML or RL.\n\n### Most common questions\n\n- What do you want to work on when you show up? Who do you want to work with? If you had unlimited compute what would you work on?\n- What was a past project you worked on? What was the impact? What did you learn?\n- What styles of communication do you prefer? Do you work in teams? Do you value mentorship?\n\n## Actionable Tips\n\n- **Coding Practice**: Consistent coding practice, such as using LeetCode premium.\n- **ML Background Interviews**: While tricky, preparing for \"ML Background\" interviews (math tricks and basic ML tradeoffs) through coursework study can be advantageous.\n- **Job Talk Preparation**: Emphasize a strong narrative and vision in your job talk, focusing less on technical detail and more on **engaging storytelling**.\n- **Research Agenda**: Clearly outlining a research agenda with timelines and goals can clarify your process and intentions for starting new projects.\n- **Saying No**: Be willing to decline unreasonable demands from companies; most are flexible and aim for a positive candidate experience.\n- **Interview Topics**: Inquire about interview preparation topics; recruiters might provide specific areas to focus on, such as programming concepts or problem-solving domains.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [AI Paygrades](https://aipaygrad.es/)\n- [2023 ML/AI Researcher Salary Report: Insights and Strategies for Successful Negotiation](https://www.teamrora.com/post/ai-researchers-salary-negotiation-report-2023)\n- [The last reliable (available) path into AI](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/path-into-ai)\n- [The AI research job market sh\\*t show (and my experience)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/ai-research-job-market)\n- [Behind the curtain: what it feels like to work in AI right now (April 2023)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/behind-the-curtain-ai)\n",

But there are rainy seasons and dry seasons, just like in our lives.\n\nIn Israel, the west wind blows it's humidity against the hillside where it condenses the cool rocks at night, along with the [23 inches](http://www.jerusalem.climatemps.com/precipitation.php) of rain Jerusalem gets each year, it's enough to grow little sprigs of grass.\n\nThere are dirt paths in the hillside where shepherds let their sheep graze on the little springs\n\nIt's not a lush green cattle pasture where everything is in abundance, but it's just enough.\n\nGod leads us along the right paths through the little springs giving us just enough for the day.\n\nSome day he'll bless us with a lot of sprigs, and other days maybe only a little. But **always enough for what we need**.\n\nHe doesn't \"make\" you lie down, but He offers His peace and contentment every day to those who seek it.\n\n### Still waters\n\nIt's hard for modern people to take life slow.\n\nWe focus on staying busy, working hard, sacrificing relationship and health at times in hopes to be rich, and God offers us a chance to slow all that down.\n\nStill waters is a shallow, quiet trickle of water gently flowing along, maybe a small creek in the park.\n\nA shepherd will never lead his sheep to a rapid flowing river. God doesn't want this for us too.\n\nHe longs to give us peace, rest, and takes us to where water is pure, and almost motionless so we refresh ourselves in Him.\n\nIt's a place where we slow down, and be quiet and still in our hearts.\n\nHis invitation to drink of His peace is found in Isaiah 55:1 which says, “Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.” He reminds us again in Revelation 7:17: “For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of water.”\n\nwe must actively seek God every day so he leads us to a continual place of rest, and prepare us for His kingdom's work.\n",

    "content": "\nToday marks 22 rotations around the Sun for me.\n\nSince I'm graduating soon, the end of this year, I wanted to reflect on my life so far from day 1 at college up till this point.\n\nI entered INTI Subang college in **Jan 2019** with my best friend from high school. We both dreamt of working at FAANG companies in the US, and share the same passion starting a company until today. I still remember the first orientation day, I went into this big hall filled with rows upon rows of students fresh out of high school, each with their own unique passions and dreams. I remember feeling anxious and alone until I saw a familiar face in one of the seats at the back.\n\nW convinced me to join the American University Program Club as committees, and I'm grateful he did. All of us in the committee became good friends. We took classes together, had lunch together at various places in SS15, and crammed for exams together at the one-floor library. We would go out for movies, have kbbq buffet together, celebrate birthdays at the mall. I remember spending a lot of my time in the freezing computer room at the library, writing medium articles and doing assignments. I remember stay late till 9 p.m. making decorations and preparing for our Halloween event.\n\nThen in 2020, COVID hit and the familiar faces became pixelated and their voices became digital. I never had to take a 1.5 hour train ride every day to campus anymore, but not being able to be around them anymore in person was sad.\n\nNow, we're all split and we don't really keep in touch anymore, but it was a point in my life where I was healthy, and I will always remember it fondly.\n\nI took a gap semester after finishing up all my units at INTI in **Summer 2020**, and I spent my time completing online courses on R and Machine Learning and reading fiction books. I enjoyed the time with my family at home. I did a lot of home workouts, I went out for jogs, I could spend the entire day just reading a book, and I was able to pursue what I was interested in. I distinctly remember reading a few pages of Crime and Punishment every night at 12 a.m. before bed in the living room, eating digestive biscuits with hot soy milk, sucked into the compelling world of Russian literature. I barely had any social interactions with people other that my family, but as an introvert, that worked out well.\n\nThen, **Jan 2021** came, and to say my life changed is an understatement. My life was struck by a disease that slowly ate away my health, physically and mentally. I went through physical turmoil, psychological torture, and experienced utter helplessness in search for a cure to the suffering.\n\nWhat I initially thought was just a minor issue with my body turned into an (now almost) 3 year fight against GERD.\n\nAfter the medicine from the first clinic didn't work, I went to a second clinic, and a hospital, and it was a slow realization, as I switched from one medicine to the next, that what I have is chronic.\n\nThe first big change was my sleep. I slept flat initially and was having burning sensations in my chest and breathing issues. I played the cover of \"Green Eyes\" and Okinawa by 92914 every night to sleep because I couldn't stand the pain. I found out that I had to sleep at an incline, and it's been that way since. You can imagine the discomfort of not being able to lie down flat, it's torture. It's like not being able to take in a deep breath, or an itch that you can never scratch. I envy people who lay flat on the ground at parks, can you imagine that?\n\nThe second biggest change was my diet. I slowly realized the amount of limitations placed on my diet as days turned into weeks, and into months. My two favorite things at that time: green tea and chocolate was out of my life from that day. Anything with pepper is off limits. I could no longer drink ice cold carbonated drinks on a hot day. I couldn't take sips of alcohol or eat mandarin oranges during Chinese New Years. No more fried chicken from Texas Chicken. No eating the crispy skin on roasted pork. And so much more. At that time, I lived on a diet of thin-noodle soup and fish paste which my mum made most days at home. It became my favorite food.\n\nThe third was my fitness. I couldn't exert my body the same way I could before. I no longer had the freedom to push myself physically, to go for jogs that made me feel alive and out of breath. All I could do was pedal the stationary bike in my house at a suitable pace. My body has been deteriorating since then. Aside from the occasional bicep curls that I can do, and that time I tried to lay down to do a bench. My body can no longer perform the way it used to.\n\nBasically, I could no longer do and eat 90% of the things I could before.\n\nI went through all this at that time, while taking midnight online classes in from ISU **Spring and Summer 2021**.\n\nMy friends never knew about my condition, and I spent most of my time home. It felt like I was battling this alone.\n\nI was switched several kinds of medications for months, and was recommended antidepressants to treat anxiety, because it's one of the triggers for GERD. Even though they relieved the symptoms, it was still creeping there. I was just never the same. I had to rely on these pills to keep me functioning, they literally reduce the amount of acid being produced in my stomach.\n\nI'm grateful for the support I have from my family to help me deal with the disease. I thought about how much worse it would be if I had this disease, but not have caring parents or the financial capabilities to seek health care.\n\nIn **August 2021**, it was time for me to fly to the US.\n\nMy best friend decided to stay in Malaysia, while I fly to the US with two of my other friends and my sister. When I first arrived, it felt nice. I've been stuck in my home for more than a year, and now I'm in a new environment with new people. I remember orientation where groups were formed, names were exchanged, and dozens booths with free stuff, the grass and the sun. I felt more free, even though I was still trapped in this body.\n\nI wasn't very socially adept, and I spent a lot of my time with the friends that I came here with.\n\nLiving with J was stressful, and only nice 20% of the time. Maybe some of his actions shaped me the way I am today, but I believe you can help people improve without making them feel bad about themselves. Denigrating others and placing that much unnecessary pressure on someone is not right.\n\nI had my first interview from the career fair, and then my second interview got pulled because I wasn't a citizen. From then on, I realized how hard it is for international students. I started fervently applying online in hopes of getting lucky. I did a lot of one-sided interviews, and continued with interviews as I was back Malaysia during winter. I don't remember much about what I did in Malaysia but it probably involved seeing doctors.\n\nAs I got back to the US in **Spring 2022**, I was told I got the offer for one of the companies. They wanted me to start asap. But because of the \"no working in the first two semester of arriving in the US restriction\" for F1 students, I couldn't take the offer. It was really defeating.\n\nMy health also got bad to the point where I had to get a medical reduced course load because I could not swallow food at all. I also found it hard to breathe. I arrived for a week and I already wanted to go back home.Eventually, medicine got me back on my feet for the time being. And it was during this time when I fell in love with hackathons. I did them back to back on weekends, and I loved the thrill.\n\nThe highlight of 2022 was my Tesla internship in **Summer 2022**. A big part of who I am and what I want today stems from the experiences I had and the people I met in the bay area. Even though I didn't like the work I did the most, being in California expanded my horizons. The world felt really small in Ames, IA. In California, I felt like it was what I was missing the whole time. I felt like I belonged. I had dozens of new experiences and made some of my closest friends during that time, albeit I did had to take PPIs the entire time to sustain myself, it made me feel like I could still live a life with GERD.\n\nIn **Fall 2022**, I was living in a new apartment. My sister helped move us out of that prison over the summer and she had to face the attacks and rage of J. It significantly improved my living conditions and it's something I should be more grateful about.\n\nI grew really depressed at this time. I felt like I was trapped in Iowa and wanted to go back to California. I realized how little this place could offer me. There's no where I can go besides the library to do my work. It's the same restaurants with sub-par food. And I couldn't fill my time with gym or any kinds of sports. I began to resent Iowa. I missed not being able to go for trips to the beach, or take the train to SF chinatown, or just be around my friends. I felt like coming to ISU was a bad decision. I should've had more agency, instead of applying here because my friends were doing it too.\n\nI started another round of internship hunt, in hopes of getting a better position in California. I stopped my medication and my condition worsened. I also started to develop really bad skin conditions (genetical) that felt like another punishment on top of GERD, and it was a lot to bear. This skin condition made me fear sugar and foods with high GI index. My food options was constrained even further. You can imagine how hard it is to avoid sugar in the US. Everything I buy in grocery stores, I look at the \"Total Sugar\" amount.\n\nI've never had confidence with my smile, because it's been crooked since I was in high school and I've dying to get it straightened till this day. And this skin condition just made it worse. I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt like I'll never be able to be with someone. That I was a deformed and unlovable. It was really hard to internalize why this was happening to me. GERD is very likely genetical, and this skin condition as well. Ever since these two disease started to consume my life, my relationship with my parents were challenged. It's really easy to blame others for genetical diseases, even though they had no part in causing it, I just have no where else to direct it too. Face time calls with my mom always revolves around the issues with my body and nothing else. I don't want her to feel bad or worried, with me being so far away, but I just can't help it. I can't fake being ok, cause I'm not.\n\nThis condition also made me get really paranoid about sweating. So all this just felt like everything was getting worse. It feels like it's going downhill ever since 2021 and I notice a pattern of issues just arising in my body.\n\nFinals were done and the early internship hunt was not a success. After the semester ended, I visited Tokyo (it was really fun) and went back to Malaysia in the winter.\n\nWhen people talk about going home, they talk about all the food they get to eat, the friends they could see again, and the health checkups to make sure they're prepared for the lack of health support in the US.\n\nWhen I went back, it was largely about dealing with my stomach and skin conditions. I had to meet with a Korean doctor with an Oriental medicine background every week. My skin condition was serious. It was weekly sessions of just delivering pure and raw pain and psychological turmoil. I was being tortured for something I couldn't control. I already had a condition that has no cure (without surgery), and with this on top of it, it just felt like I was cursed. It felt like God hated me. I did another GERD scope, which the conclusion was basically I developed a Type I hernia from doing situps and I just have to deal with that with strong medicine and lifestyle changes. Not very helpful if you ask me.\n\nI did get to eat some of the food I enjoyed, got to see my friend group from college. One month passes by really quick.\n\nI came back to the US and endured the cold, freezing weather of Iowa again, and started **Spring 2023**. The cold aggravates my symptoms, it squeezes my core. I can't wear clothing that's too tight cause of my skin condition. I felt broken.\n\nI started attending a Chinese church at this time, and they provided a lot of support. The elderly people were super kind and caring, it felt like home. I stopped going church in 2022 because the bigger churches felt so lonely, and the disease was really shaking my faith. It was hard to accept that God would place this on me. It's easy to say suffering builds tolerance, and it makes you stronger, and you will come out of this a better person. But I'm going through all this right now, living it day by day, at this very second, it's still there. When will it end?\n\nMy skin conditions came back in March and I had to take antibiotics. I went through a lot of discomfort. I hated my body. Eventually the antibiotics helped and things started to look better. My colleague reached out to me and asked if I wanted to go back to the team for the summer. I failed Glassdoor's 3-round interview, so going back was the only option.\n\n**Summer 23**. It was really nice to be back. I got to see old friends and make new ones. I went for a lot of AI events and hackathons, it felt unreal being in the same room with CEOs and YC founders, sitting at the same table with stanford Ph.D. students, and staying up all night at the ferry building in San Francisco for my app to be presented and awarded. I went to my first american party (and another one later on), although it was more like a networking event since everyone were interns. My parents came to visit for 3 weeks and it was nice driving them around to touristy spots, and eat good food. They liked it a lot, especially since I was paying for everything. I felt like an adult for the first time. It was 14 weeks filled with adventure, thrill, and lots of networking. I'm a little more confident in speaking now, although still trying to be less awkward. During this time, I got back on PPIs cause it started to flare up, but the in-house Tesla doctors told me to stop taking them, because my bones will break easier due to the side effects of long term PPIs. I was worried. So I switched to something else that was less effective, but less harmful. I eventually stopped taking them when I felt better.\n\nLeaving California again was hard. My old friends came back full time, and I felt like I was delaying my life. I also had only one more class to graduate, and I was contemplating a lot about coming back to Iowa. But now I'm glad I did. I was really burnt out in California, and never took the time to rest.\n\n**Fall 2023**. The first few weeks being back was hard, I felt really bored. Not because I didn't have anything to do, but because what used to be 8 hours of work, and then outings and events after work hours and in the weekends turned into 2 hours of classes a week.\n\nI got a chance to visit Toronto in September for the Airflow summit. It was my first all-paid-for conference and it was fun to say the least. I got to meet two of my friends from last summer. We caught up with dim-sum and hotpot, and I'm glad I got to see them again, and hope to in the future. I walked around UofT, saw a protest, and got to meet interesting people.\n\nLately I've been busy applying to grad school with my best friend from college. He never got to come to the US and now I'm hoping we go to the same grad school and work on our company together. I've been doing hackathons again, writing articles, working on side projects. Having more time on my hands is a curse and a blessing. A lot of the work is intrinsically motivated.\n\nI don't see my friends as often anymore cause we don't take the same classes. We just celebrated one of their birthdays and it's nice to be able to sit down and have dinner with them. It almost feels bittersweet. 2 years passed by quickly. I start to remember all the dinners we had together, the assignments we worked on, and the discord calls. I don't know where each of us will be next year.\n\nMy skin condition came back this month, and it killed me. I had a lot of breakdowns this semester. I would sit on the carpeted floor in my bedroom just spiralling and tearing up.\n\nIt hurts in the shower, so I blast worship music and sing in the bathroom to deal with the pain. I feel anger, sadness, disgust all at the same time. I've spent days crying in the bathroom saying I can't take this anymore.\n\nIt's scary to not feel comfortable with seeking healthcare as an international student because of the cost. Apparently I was dealing with my condition using the wrong methods (which seemed right at that time), and it was making it worse. Now I'm left with bandages and ointments and antibiotics every day, in hopes of a fast recovery for my Boston trip.\n\nSo that brings me to **today**.\n\nI had a good birthday celebration. I spent it with people I love and care about. I got wishes from my close friends, and it made me realize how blessed it is to have them in my life. And how much I appreciate them being in my life.\n\nThe past 2 years of my life has been revolving around these issues, these rules that helps avoid triggering these diseases, and it's still hard for me to accept it.\n\nI stopped medication a while now, but my symptoms come and go, the most frequent one being the heartburns that induces asthma like symptoms and the stabbing pain in my lower-left abdomen. And the occasional sore throat and ulcers at the back of my tongue. I wake up feeling horrible, and never well rested, and I can never figure out if it's because of my conditions.\n\nI'm terrified that this is my life now and I hate this life. I'll never be able to life like a normal person. I won't get the chance to be drunk at parties. To bar hop with friends late night in NYC. To just be able to try out new foods and desserts without worrying about whether it is worth the risk of utter pain and maybe cancer or my skin condition developing. To backpack across europe and go on crazy hikes. Doing fun and dumb things that a young person in his 20s get to do. To get married and have kids. To just be.\n\nMy mom keeps telling me to focus on what I still can do, and it's not a lot. I try to see a silver lining, but it's suffocating to be in this body. Most days I can distract myself with writing, coding side projects, with good kpop music, but at the end of it all, I'm still sick. When it's quiet and I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm consumed with fear.\n\nI was asked what did I learn from this condition that I have today. Here's my attempt at answering that.\n\nI learned that my faith wasn't as strong as I thought. It's easy to believe in God when things are going well. But when you're struck down with diseases and your health is stolen away from you, like Job, can you still sustain? Will you hold strong in believing, with no guarantee that things will be better? Right now I'm still battling with this.\n\nI learned that in tough times, it's so easy to spiral in circles and not see a way out. It feels like everything is closing in and this is everything, and it's forever, that it won't change. With issues that takes time to heal, where progress is not immediate, it's hard to visualize that things do get better. Under duress, my brain focuses on the current too much. I've found that talking to people helps, and I'm the kind that would rather suffer in silence than ask for help so it's been challenging. Or talking in the third person, and rationalizing through the situation and repeating \"It's going to be ok\" and \"This is not forever\"\n\nI learned that there are issues that people are facing that you can't see. People see me and think I'm healthy and fine, and I'm not. I'm disabled. So it's better to be kind to everyone, even when I'm in pain, I try to make other people's lives better. I'm still selfish at times, especially with my family, and that's something I'm working on.\n\nI learned that gratitude is essential to deal with big life issues, and might be the precursor to radical acceptance. If I was more grateful with what I do have in my life, if I'm around people I love, these issues fade away. It used to be all there is, it clouded my thoughts, but through gratitude, it becomes smaller.\n\nI'm going back Malaysia after graduating to hopefully fix most of my health issues.\n\nI suffered through the whole ISU experience in hopes of achieving the FAANG dream, and if not that, I could've went back to Tesla. It would be a nice life still. But I can't.\n\nHere's hoping that in the midst of suffering and despair, I see a way out of it.\n\nPeople say I sound dead and tired, and I honestly don't know whether I was like this all the time, or the accumulation of suffering over years that rendered me like this. People say suffering builds strength, but it seems to just be making me worn out and tired. Maybe I'm just not strong enough. I find it hard to garner up the energy to do things nowadays. I'm just tired of everything.\n\nI thought a lot about how to continue living a meaningful life in the face of trials and tribulations. How to live when you're limited in so many ways and life seems to be working against you. When things that used to provide joy are off-limits. When a basic need like health, something a lot of people take granted for, is not met. And there's little you can do about it besides medicine, where you suffer the side effects later on in life. A life time of medicine.\n\nBut who knows. Maybe I'm just overthinking things and being emotional as a 22 year old who's never faced big life challenges until this happened to me.\n\nI know life is never fair, and life is suffering. And I like to believe that God only places as much suffering in your life as you can bear. He also places people in your life to help you get through them. So far, I feel less alone.\n\nMaybe I live with this disease for the rest of my life, but I adapt and it could still be meaningful.\n\nOr maybe years into the future, I'm healthy again, looking back at my life in my early 20s and remember only the good parts.\n",

[Data modelling](https://medium.com/@seckindinc/data-modeling-fundamentals-dba245b7dc9f)\n   - **entity**: a concept or object in real world that can be uniquely identified (ex: person, place), represented by a table in db\n   - **attribute**: characteristics of entity (ex: name, age), represented by a column in db\n   - **relationship**: how entities are related to each other (ex: person has a name), can be 1-1, 1-many, many-many.\n2. Events, Message Queues, and Workers\n   - distributed systems that process work in real time (APIs) and asynchronously (queues + workers)\n   - one key piece of asynchronous systems is [message queues](https://medium.com/must-know-computer-science/system-design-message-queues-245612428a22), which are used to:\n     - rate limit processing of events\n     - communicate between microservices\n     - shard load of specific types of events to be processed at different rates\n     - batch process a bunch of events\n   - ex: instead of one mega server handing all tasks, throw them on a queue, have worker pods scale and pick them up, and send them asynchronously\n   - also used for [interservice communication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/design/interservice-communication)\n3. Autoscaling infrastructure\n   - for monoliths: setup autoscaling ec2\n   - for microservices: implement horizontal pod autoscaling in k8s\n   - db: amazon aurora spins up new replicas based on increase load\n4. Cloud Technologies\n   - can't avoid learning, need real-world experience solving business scaling problems\n   - ex in AWS\n     - SNS, SQS : message queues\n     - S3 : storage\n     - kafka, kinesis: event streaming\n     - EC2: monoliths\n5. Caching\n   - caching allows system to handle more load, respond faster, without scaling up\n   - read engineering blogs and system design to understand where/when to apply caching, instead of just saying \"throw redis at it\"\n   - types of caching:\n     - site cache: serve content quickly to return users\n     - application/output cache: server level HTML caching\n     - distributed data cache: redis, memcached\n     - file caching: CDN for static files\n6. Concurrency / Idempotency\n   - [idempotency](https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency) = ability to execute same operation multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application\n     - ex: customer submitting same order multiple times (because of bugs) -> only one order is created\n     - how? send an [idempotency key](https://brandur.org/idempotency-keys) via api request, where it could be a hashed key of the forms data\n",

    "content": "\nI talked to J today, a UX designer.\n\nHe interviewed 16 designers and developers and there are 3 common themes of issues they face in collaborating.\n\n1. Lack of documentation\n2. Communication gaps\n3. Lack of **context**\n\nThe idea is to have LLMs to have context of conversations between the designers and developers in a team, so that they can collaborate better.\n\nHe mentioned feeding it the Design System of a company, which is unique to each company. And have access to the file system to see file changes.\n\nThe idea could be to have a landing page to serve as the ground truth, the status of the project, issues being worked on, pain points, etc.\n\nI liked the idea of having an agent pull up relevant information in a chat while you're talking to someone. It's like having a personal assistant.\n\nDesigners have this vision of how the product should look like, the user experience, while developers just want to build it.\n\nThere's a lot of back and forth between the two, and it's hard to keep track of the changes. Requirements also change every week, so designs have to be updated.\n\nIt's interesting to think about how LLMs can fit into this workflow.\n\nI told him that I believe designers can be developers in the future, and it's easier for designers to code than developers to learn design, and he thought the exact opposite.\n\nLLMs are already being used internally in companies to help boost productivity and collaboration.\n\nIt's just a matter of time before your coworker(s) is a locally-hosted LLM model that you can talk to, instead of waiting for a response from another team/department.\n",

    "content": "\nMy professor was teaching about [hypothesis testing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) in class today.\n\nIt reminded me of some blogs by [Allen Downey](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/) that I bookmarked ages ago.\n\nI read through [them](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html) in class and this is the [framework](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html) to takeaway about hypothesis tests.\n\n1. Compute **test statistic** that measures size of apparent effect. It could be a difference between two groups, absolute difference in means, see more examples [here](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/06/more-hypotheses-less-trivia.html). We call this test statistic 𝛿\n2. Define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model of the world under which the assumption that effect is not real, ex: if you think there is a difference between group A and B, H0 = there is no difference between A and B.\n3. Model of null hypothesis should be [stochastic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic), that is, capable of simulating data similar to original data.\n4. Goal: compute p-value (probability of seeing an effect as big as 𝛿 under null hypothesis). You can estimate p-value using **simulation**: calculate the same test statistic you used on the actual data for each simulation.\n5. Count the fraction of times the test statistic exceeds 𝛿. This fraction approximates p-value. If it's sufficiently small, you can conclude that the apparent effect is [unlikely due to chance](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/05/hypothesis-testing-is-only-mostly.html).\n\n## Why simulation?\n\n- analytical methods are slow and expensive, but even as computation gets faster, they are appealing because they are\n  - **inflexible**: using a standard test -> particular test statistic and model, might not be appropriate for problem domain.\n  - **opaque**: real-world scenario has many possible models, based on different assumptions. In standard tests, assumptions are implicit, not easy to know whether model is appropriate.\n- simulation on the other hand, are\n  - **explicit**: creating a simulation forces you to think about your modeling decisions, the simulations themselves document those decisions.\n  - **arbitrarily flexible**: can try out several test statistics and models, can choose most appropriate one for the scenario.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Statistical Rethinking 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) ([website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/))\n- [Hypothesis testing - Think Stats 2e](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html)\n",

    "content": "\nOn how to be a good codemate by [Brian Lee](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/codemates/).\n\nSome takeaways/interesting points:\n\n- It has everything to do with settings expectations on how you communicate and collaborate within a shared codebase, not your coding ability or quality\n- tell your teammates how to **test your workflow**, hook the script (unit test, integration test, or bash script) into CI so your codemates can't accidentally break you, [tests](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html#the_beyonceacutesemicolon_rule) are the only scalable way to inform your team on how to not break your code.\n- changes requiring manual steps need to be **announced publicly**, ex: updated dependency, changes in AWS account permissions. The pro move is to use tools that transparently and automatically install and use currently checked-in configs\n- effort in writing actual code is in equal parts of packaging code that satisfies all automated linters, test coverage requirements, links to tickets, and other blocking requirements\n- adopt mindset of investing in formatters that automatically fix formatting issues, than linters that nag you about issues\n- One common toe-stepping maneuver is refactoring - renaming modules, moving functions/classes around. Merge conflicts are inevitable\n- Refactoring benefits: compress mental map needed to understand how the codebase works.\n- Refactoring cost: people need to relearn their mental map, a needless refactor is like sorting a bookshelf by color - unnecessary and productivity killer\n- Two rules for refactoring: (1) **Don't Refactor**, get formatting and naming right the [first time](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/noutils/), (2) **don't mix refactors with feature changes**, refactoring changes are 10-100x easier to review than normal feature-adding changes. Look at [Google monorepo](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNF) for managing refactors at larger scale\n- flake tests build up in CI, causing it to rerun multiple time before passing, CI runtime only increase, and eventually people stop trusting CI. senior eng become reviewing bottlenecks.\n- Adopt \"leap of faith\" strategy and pretend CI can be trusted, and figure out tests that can catch your mistakes, and add it. The cost of breaking main branch is equally expensive to suffer through worry-laden code review process.\n- Have a quick rollback procedure to mitigate accidental breakage.\n- The ultimate solution is to embrace [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), shard codebase along organizational lines, reduce O(n^2) cost of coordinating people's work\n",

George had a struggle writing lyrics for \"Something\".\n- creative work bears a strong resemblance to play. Sometimes, it's all a matter of perspective\n\n### Notes\n\n- Don't be afraid to **take a break** from a project: John and Paul would come together when they're stuck on song writing; Mark Twain took year long breaks\n- Use **different tools** for different writing states: ex: sketch ideas in a different font than the final form; write out ideas and type it as it takes shape\n- Give **chance** a chance: free-association and cut-up techniques break us out of conventions\n- make it **easy to capture ideas**: it's easy to capture them with our phones today, ex: Charlie Puth sings into voicenotes on his phone\n",

    "content": "\nSome statistics on plastic\n\n- [430 million tons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10013851/) of plastic is produced yearly\n- One-third of this total takes the form of single-use plastics\n- [95% of the plastic](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf) used in packaging is disposed of after one use, a loss to the economy of up to $120 billion annually\n- One-third of this packaging is not collected -> significant economic cost by reducing productivity of vital natural systems such as the ocean -> $40 billion in damages\n- Coca-Cola produced 3 million tons of plastic packaging in 2017\n- Average person consumes [five grams](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured/plastic-ingestion-by-people-could-be-equating-to-a-credit-card-a-week) of plastic every week—mostly from water\n- About [95% of the tap water](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/you-eat-a-credit-card-s-worth-of-plastic-a-week-research-says/) in the United States is contaminated\n\n### Solution\n\nPicking up waste is only fixing a symptom of a larger problem\n\nThe solution lies further upstream: we have to make less plastic, develop better, more recyclable products, and find sustainable alternatives that increase [circularity](https://www.unep.org/circularity) (keeping products in use as long as possible)\n\nHow much plastic is actually being [recycled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_recycling)?\n\nIn the US, only about [5-6% of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/12/1081129/plastic-recycling-climate-change-microplastics) are being recycled.\n\n### Infrastructure and incentive\n\nThe biggest problem is a shortage of the [costly infrastructure](https://plasticsrecycling.org/our-team) that's required.\n\nThe further from large cities, the less recycling. More **state and federal incentives** to build an **infrastructure for collection** is needed.\n\n### challenges of recycling\n\nThe vast [majority](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/sustainability/how-is-plastic-recycled-a-step-by-step-guide-to-recycling.aspx) of \"recycling\" is grinding plastic, melting it, and re-forming it. This mechanical recycling well involves properly sorting and cleaning materials, which is time intensive and expensive.\n\nIt's also very [difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/)/impossible to recycle many types of plastic more than once without causing the material to acquire **defects and [contaminants](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/recycling-contamination/)** (many recycled materials contain high levels of unwanted toxins)\n\n### local policies for recycling\n\nLocal policies make a huge difference.\n\nMaine and Oregon invested in recycling programs, and up to 80% of bottles made from PET ([polyethylene terephthalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)) are recycled. In some states, such as in the South, that percentage is in the single digits.\n\nThe national average for these materials is 30%.\n\nSome states have policies that [hinder progress](https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/).\n\nIndustry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute [state-level laws](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation) that **prevent** bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags.\n\nOver a dozen states currently have [preemptive laws](https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/preemption/) on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics\n\n### Improving recycling\n\nOne, simplify and standardize process of plastic production. Currently more than 10,000 chemicals are used, and upward 3,200 have \"one or more [hazardous properties](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report) of concern\"\n\nSecond, find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials, instead of having to sort everything first. For example, [chemical process](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.2c00402) that can [transform several types of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/30/1063837/how-chemists-are-tackling-the-plastics-problem/) into propane, and using [soil bacterium](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4626) to break down plastics and re-form them to bioplastics.\n\nThird, using microbes that can break down and recycle [PET](https://www.americanbeverage.org/education-resources/blog/post/what-is-pet/). One company doing this is [Carbios](https://www.carbios.com/en/). A [microbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideonella_sakaiensis) discovered in Japan in 2016 was the first one identified that can live solely on plastic as a food source.\n\n### reducing demand\n\nTo solve the problem in the plastic pollution crisis, we must solve the root problem: _plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap_\n\nPolymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require **policy and behavioral changes** small and large.\n\nTiny changes can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution.\n\nExample: policymakers in Washington, DC instituted five-cent charge on plastic bags in 2010, and estimates show number of bags dropped by more than half in months, and quantity found in [local waterways dropped 30%-70%](https://gwhatchet.com/2018/02/07/district-tax-leads-to-sharp-decrease-in-plastic-bag-use/)\n\nA global [Extended Producer Responsibility](https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm) scheme would be an example of a major shift.\n\nChange will be difficult, but they can be instituted in a way that don't hurt businesses.\n\nCreating incentives for alternatives -> innovation and new jobs.\n",

If he did not believe that one must live for something, he would not live.\n> — Leo Tolstoy, A Confession\n\nAnother great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDjrTkssZmE) by Horses on the topic of [Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death).\n\nHe reflects on thoughts of death and the works of [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy): \"The Confession\" and \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\".\n\nIn [_The Confession_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26244.A_Confession), he attempts to find the meaning of life on the examples of science, philosophy, eastern wisdom, and opinions of his fellow writers.\n\nTolstoy [concludes](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/) that there are [four ways](https://www.swarthmorereview.com/posts/2-8-22-tolstoys-confession) to live in the face of death:\n\n1. **Ignorance**: Not think about the absurdity of existence, the problem is once start thinking about these things, you can never go back\n2. **Epicureanism**: Filling life with pleasure - drinking from an [endless supply of honey](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/life-proverb) and ignoring the beast\n3. **Suicide**: One realizes the foolishness of existence, and have the willpower to end their lives\n4. **Acceptance of life** (by weakness): clings to life because of the lack of courage to end it all, so you accept it instead.\n\n[_The Death of Ivan Ilyich_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych) is a fantastic companion piece to _The Confession_, it talks about Ivan, a man who is brought face to face with his own mortality.\n\nI read this in my plane ride back to school from California, and getting a terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, to experience the agony and suffering of a man to be on the brink of death made me examine my life.\n\nIt made me reflect on what it means to truly live, to not be in my death bed and be filled with regrets about the way I lived my life.\n\nIt made me wonder the things I'm doing that fulfills the expectations of others, like how Ivan fell for the trappings of status, adoration, success.\n\nIt was depressing he felt so isolated in his deathbed, he was surrounded by the most shallow of people, even his wife, and just wanted someone to comfort and cry with him.\n\nAfter his death, people who went to his funeral did not mourn for Ivan, in fact, they selfishly thought about the promotions they would get, and even annoyed by the tasks they must perform. Broadly, they are filled with joy, that it is Ivan who died, not them\n\nThinking about death from time to time is a good practice. Memento mori. I hope to truly live, and to be surrounded with people I love, and leave this world in peace.\n\n> A life poorly lived only amplifies the horrors of death or create them entirely. So I believe the answer in death is not found in what happens after or during or even why we all must die, but instead in how we live.\n",

Simply because too many things in business piling up ahead of then that they can't get through.\"\n>\n> I still claim that anyone that wants to can do it. Things are looking better and I look forward to not giving a demonstration of my theory for some time.\n>\n> “Me. I like life very much. So much it will be a big disgust when I have to shoot myself. Maybe pretty soon. I guess.\"\n>\n> \"I'll tell you, it's like being in a Kafka nightmare. I act cheerful like always but am not. I'm bone tired and very beat up emotionally.\n\nTowards the end of his life, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nHe lost his ability to write after [electroconvulsive therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/), and eventually lead him to his suicide.\n\nThat's not to say Hemmingway was a victim, he made a lot of bad choices in his life, was a bad father, and was a womanizer, and an ego obsessed liar.\n\nBut should look deeper than the labels.\n\nWe should consider not just the who of Hemmingway, but also the why and how.\n\nWe should carry some empathy and compassion into conversations about people, perhaps especially the dead, because they are not here to make their own case. To them, I believe, we owe honesty.\n",

    "content": "\nThere are [Golden Rules](https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4147) for being a good mentee.\n\nHere are four key recommendations for best practice.\n\n### 1. Select the right mentor(s)\n\n- finding suitable mentors is a process of judgement and learning, there needs to be congruence between your goals and the skills and knowledge of the mentor\n- Find someone with content expertise, or influence in a field, who has a wide network of contacts\n- Someone in the top of their field isn't necessarily a good mentor, personal attributes (patience) and values (altruism) are fundamental to a good relationship. You should like, respect and trust your mentor.\n\n### 2. Be respectful of your mentor's time and manage it wisely\n\n- Be proactive in scheduling appointments, plan a regular slot\n- Plan for meetings by setting out agendas and prioritising discussion points\n- Include a timeline to schedule each item so the both of you focus on what is important\n- Propose solutions to help your mentor decide which answer may be best (\"managing up\")\n- request actions before meetings to help your mentor prepare \"Please review X so we can discuss at our meeting\"\n\n### 3. Communicate efficiently and effectively\n\n- begin with honest conversations regarding your goals and aspirations\n- include a written plan of short and long term goals, which helps share a vision of success with your mentor\n- Clarify roles and expectations on both sides to minimise conflict and disappointment.\n- establish regular cadence of communication that includes goals and progress towards them, for example: summary of current project status, including progress and problems, discussion of new projects, etc.\n- pay attention to your \"talking-to-listening ratio\", it should be less than one. You should be listening more than you are talking.\n- Send focused messages with brief background that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\" are ideal\n\n### 4. Be engaged, energising, and collaborative\n\n- avoid emotionally draining behaviours, such as complaining, pessimism, and \"snarking\" about others.\n- Show that you are mature and genuinely open to learning\n- be an energy donor, not an energy recipient\n- help drive projects forward, be proactive, and accept all comments as important learning opportunities\n- Be a \"closer\" : someone who follows through on tasks in timely fashion and at a high standard.\n- Be generous and honest in giving others credit, you're working with not just your mentor, but other colleagues and the wider scientific community.\n",

    "content": "\n[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) (data build tool) is a CLT that enables data analyst and [engineers](https://www.getdbt.com/data-teams/hiring-data-engineer) to transform data in their [data warehouses](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/data-warehouse) more effectively.\n\n### where\n\ndbt is the T in [ETL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/etl).\n\nIt doesn't extract or load, but it sits on top of your warehouse and transforms data that's already loaded.\n\nThis is known as [ELT](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/elt).\n\nELT is becoming more prevalent because data warehouses like Bigquery and Snowflake are extremely performant and scalable, that transformations can be more effectively handed in-database rather than elsewhere.\n\n### What\n\nSo [what](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt) does it do?\n\nThe only function of dbt is to take code, compile it to SQL, and run it against your database.\n\nAt the most basic level, it's a compiler and a runner.\n\nYou write dbt code in a text editor of your choice, or the [IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) in dbt cloud, and run dbt in the cli.\n\ndbt compiles all the code into raw sql, and execute it against a configured data warehouse.\n\ndbt code has two core workflows: **building** data [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models) and **testing** data models\n\n### building models\n\nA data model is any transformed [view](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/view) of raw data.\n\nTo create a model, you write a SQL SELECT statement. dbt then builds it in the database, materializing it as a view or [table](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/table).\n\nThis model then can be queried by other models or analytical tools.\n\n[Materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations) means the strategy ([DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl)) by which a data model is built in the warehouse. Or in other words, the manner in which data is represented.\n\n### testing\n\nYou can [test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests) the integrity of SQL in each model by making assertions.\n\nYou can test for things like:\n\n- whether a specificed column only has non-null or unique\n- values that have a corresponding value in another model\n- values from a list\n- custom tests that suit business logic\n\nThere are two ways to define a test: singular and generic.\n\nSingular tests is test in its simplest form. You write a SQL query that returns failing rows, save it in a .sql file in your test directory.\n\nGeneric tests are parameterized queries that accept arguments. they can be reused over and over, and are defined in a test block.\n\nThey're defined in a .yml file in `models` directory\n\nOut of the box, dbt ships with four generic tests already defined: unique, not_null, accepted_values and relationships.\n\n### dbt code\n\nWhat is dbt code exactly?\n\nit's a combination of SQL and Jinja, a common templating language used in Python.\n\nFor example, `ref()` is a function that gives users the ability to reference other models in their code.\n\nref does two things: interpolates itself into raw SQL as the appropriate schema.table, and it automatically builds [DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dag) of all the models in a project.\n\nWith Jinja, you can do if statements, loops, macros, and gives SQL superpowers.\n\n### modular code\n\ndbt also has additional functions and variables, where you can express logic that checks if code is running in dev vs prod, state of database. etc.\n\nThis allows you to write modular code that can automate complicated and time-consuming tasks.\n\nThis means dbt gives users powerful tools to build, ship and share their own transformations.\n\nWhich is why dbt ships with a package manager.\n\nSo to summarize everything, here's why dbt is so [powerful](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction):\n\n- avoid writing boilerplate [DML](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dml) and [DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl), just write SELECT statements and dbt takes cares of materialization\n- build reusable, modular data models that can be referenced\n- reduce the time it takes for queries to run with metadata\n- Use Jinja in SQL for control structures, macros, hooks\n- Publish packages that can be referenced by otherse\n- Use source control processes like branching, PRs\n- Write data quality tests quickly and easily\n- [document](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation) descriptions for each model and field\n- snapshots your data to track changes or reconstruct historic values\n",

The hours from 7 to 12 are your time to build for the future before the world descends on you.\n\nIn economics, a [discount rate](https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/discounting-101/) is used to assess the present value of future benefits, with a higher rate devaluing distant gains.\n\nA zero discount rate refers to the idea of not diminishing the value of future benefits when assessing the importance of tasks. It emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their true significance and long-term impact, without devaluing them due to the time it takes to achieve those benefits.\n\nCowen [suggests](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/09/do-i-wish-to-revise-my-time-management-tips.html) using a \"zero discount rate\" to evaluate tasks. This means prioritizing tasks based on their importance, regardless of the time it takes to reap the benefits.\n\nCowen advises focusing on vital tasks early in the day and avoiding exceptions. He emphasizes that the morning hours (7 to 12) are the best time to work on important tasks, free from external distractions.\n\nThis also applies to [selecting good projects](https://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/using-zero-discount-rate-could-help-choose-better-projects-and-help-get-net-zero-carbon) that help save the climate.\n\nWhere are you reaping short-term benefits because it's easy and it seems important?\n\nWhat is distracting you from working on something that helps you achieve your long-term goals?\n",

I got some pork baos too. I chose take out, so I could eat it at a park in UofT.\n\nI walked through the campus and saw many [Romanseque Revival-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_Revival_architecture) buildings.\n\nI walked 20 minutes to Queen's park, and saw a protest going on. I sat down on a bench and ate my rice noodles.\n\nI went back to my Airbnb to keep my baos for later.\n\nI went out to get my haircut. I went to People's Salon and got a haircut for 20 CAD.\n\nI went back for a quick shower, and started off to the conference.\n\nI stopped at the chinese bakery to get some pastries.\n\nI got an egg tart, a bbq pork pastry, red bean pastry, lotus, and wife cake.\n\nI walked to the Marriott while eating all the pastries I bought.\n\nI arrived at 12.\n\nI met a Singaporean girl, she was working at a startup in Toronto while taking classes. She's studying statistics in NUS. She was a year younger than me. She might be the youngest person at the summit.\n\nI couldn't eat any of the food at lunch, but sat down with her and talked about a lot of things.\n\nWe walked out to a korean restaurant and I ordered Bibimbap for takeout.\n\nWe talked about our careers, about how I don't have a strong accent, about the weather.\n\nI went back to the hotel to eat my take out, while she went to the sessions.\n\nI went for the use cases sessions the entire day with her.\n\nAfter the last session, we went to the after party at the Sheraton.\n\nWe walked past the skating rink with the Toronto sign, and took a picture.\n\nWe got to the hotel, went up the escalator, and got tickets for the drinks.\n\nWe went out into the patio and saw multiple food stations, a charcuterie station, and a live band.\n\nIt was time to network.\n\nI initiated a conversation with a chinese guy, he works as a privacy engineer at Snapchat.\n\nAfter talking briefly about his work relating to user data privacy, he went to take a call\n\nI went to another table and talked to the guy who gave the one of the opening talk on open-source.\n\nI asked him for advice about open source, how it makes money, whether there is enough support for contributors, about his favorite project, the next up and coming programming language, and about LLMs space.\n\nI awkwardly left the conversation, and went found the Snapchat guy again.\n\nWe continued our conversation for the next 30 minutes or so, talking about his time at Google, his time at Snapchat, and about a lot of other things.\n\nIt was close to 8:30 p.m., and I started looking for C, but she went home.\n\nBefore leaving, I felt a sinking feeling, that I didn't talk to enough people.\n\nNetworking is hard, you need to find the right exploit vs explore balance. You have to have a long enough conversation to build rapport, but not too long that you're stuck with one person.\n\nI had an idea about asking people directly if they were hiring, maybe that would be a good idea.\n\nAs a last-ditch effort, I went to the Astronomer booth and asked if they were hiring.\n\nThe marketing new hire put my information down in her notebook.

And it was only $1 per ride.\n\nToronto is such a diverse city, a quick scan of the crowd, I can find people of different ethnicity.\n\nI got off at Bay St, and walked towards the Marriott.\n\nBreakfast was croissants, I sat down beside the guy I held the door for into the hotel.\n\nHe went to Oregon State, and works at AWS. He came to the US the same year I was born.\n\nWe went into the main hall, and the summit kicked off.\n\nI wrote notes, and started gathering potential people I could message for a job. The talks were at the big hall till 11 a.m.\n\nAfter that the sessions were split into 4 ballrooms.\n\nIn between were breaks, I went to each sponsor booth and had a good chat with the people there, and got nice swags. Google put the most effort in their swags.\n\nI found the Taiwanese guy who is now working in Paris, asked him about his life there, mentioned that you're forced to take PTOs, so senior employees sometimes leave for the whole summer.\n\nDuring lunch, I sat beside also a Taiwanese guy, he's paid to work on open-source projects, he's worked in Singapore and Japan, but settled back Taiwan.\n\nThe thing about these airflow talks is I haven't faced those problems before, so a person like me listening is not able to appreciate their solutions as much as a senior data engineer who's experienced the challenges that come up with scale.\n\nI got bored from the talks, went out and talked to a sales guy at the Snowflake booth.\n\nWe talked about snowflake vs databricks at first, then sports, then US cities, US vs Canada, and I thanked him for his interesting thoughts.\n\nI went for the last talk, and talked to someone sitting beside me. He's worked multiple companies, including Apple, and is now at a startup in Texas. He's a head of data, and likes that he can take ownership of the data stack.\n\nI left the Marriott 6:30 p.m. and went to the BMV bookstore. I browsed the literature section, then the philosophy section, and bought \"The Conquest of Happiness\" by Bertrand Russell. It seemed like the most practical book there for my life as a lost 21 year old.\n\nI stopped by a canadian gift store, got some chocolates for friends.\n\nThen I saw a mini HMart packed in between two stores, I squeezed into the store and found kimbap, and bought it for lunch the next day.\n\nNext stop was IKEA. I went in and ordered 6 beef meatballs and a $1 hot dog on the screens. I saw the packaged almond cake in the freezer, and was reminded of eating it back in Malaysia.\n\nIt was close to 8, I travelled back to the Eaten Centre Mall.\n\nI arrived at Yonge-Dundas Square, and took some pictures. It's like a mini times square.\n\nI went into UNIQLO first thing to buy a t-shirt.\n\nThen I went underground and got pocket hand sanitizers at BABW. The handpicked apple scent was nice.\n\nI got hungry and went in search for food.\n\nI came across a sushi store, with a big sale sign. The lady mentioned it was buy one get one free, I did some quick filtering to look for what I could eat, and I only saw two boxes of cali roll. I bought it and went down to the food court to feast.\n\nUnfortunately it was laced with wasabi, so I couldn't eat it. I dumped one, and kept the other in hopes I could give it to someone.\n\nI passed by SzeChuan house, and they were also selling their food at a discount. I bought a two big boxes of fried rice and bean sprouts, at only 10 CAD. What a steal.\n\nI ate a little bit of it, but decided I should go back to my airbnb and eat it there.\n\nI booked a Lyft, and waited for it to arrive inside because I had no internet.\n\nAs I walked out to find the driver, I was apparently on the wrong street.\n\nAs I frantically tried to find the car, there was a drum performance going on, people and cars in all directions, a protest that just started, and it was chaotic.\n\nI finally found the car, and got in.\n\nThe driver asked me what the protest was about, I said I didn't know.\n\nFirst impressions, downtown Toronto is really packed. I don't quite understand why all the stores are small. The sidewalks are smaller too.\n\nI liked seeing the streetcar going in every direction. Although getting on and off is pretty unsafe, as there's no platform, you're literally stepping onto the road.\n\nI saw groups of chinese and korean people hanging out as I walked Yonge Street, I thought about what my life would be like if I grew up here or if I went to school here.\n\nIt made me think about how much a place shapes you.\n",

So far it's just people going from one bar to another, dancing, and drinking a lot, which is the culture of the time.\n\nI landed in O'hare airport in search for food. I got a salad from a restaurant called Summer House, they did not get my order correct. I ate only the lettuce. I got a plain hamburger from McDonald's for the protein and some bagel bites from Auntie Anne's to satisfy my cravings.\n\nFirst impression of flying Air Canada is the use of French by the flight attendants and the announcements on the plane.\n\nThe plane was pretty old, the interface for the entertainment system was also super slow, like each click will take 5 seconds and the hourglass loading animation would show up.\n\nI read more of \"The Sun Also Rises\" on the plane. I stopped at the part where Jake and Bill were fishing in Spain.\n\nI started noticing French translations in all the signs.\n\nI exchanged some Canadian dollars, bought a $12.35 ticket for the UP Express train to downtown Toronto.\n\nAt one point the scene outside of the window looked like Kuala Lumpur.\n\nWhen I arrived at Union station, it was confusing.\n\nI waited for R and H, my friends from Tesla to meet up.\n\nWe found each other, and drove into Kensington Market.\n\nWe passed by many mushrooms and weed shops, something I found surprising.\n\nWe headed towards Juicy Dumplings, and got souped dumplings and Pan Fried juicy pork buns.\n\nAfter that, we decided to get hot pot. It was H's first time trying.\n\nWe walked around more as we waited for a text to be seated.\n\nH talked about his fear of getting stabbed by someone with a needle, which made both of us paranoid.\n\nChinatown was relatively quiet that night, perhaps because it was a Monday.\n\nWe sat down at 8:35 p.m.\n\nWe promptly ordered our soup, some cuts of beef and lamb, and made our sauce.\n\nThe beef was the best I've ever had, there was a crunch to it, and it was tender.\n\nWe talked about what 20 year olds would talk about.\n\nAfter dinner, we went to our airbnb to check in.\n\nWe said our goodbyes, and promised to see each other again in the bay.\n\nI struggled with the wifi, knocked on someone's door, and met A, a film student from South Korea.\n\nI took a shower, unpacked, called my parents, did some writing.\n\nI slept at 2:30 a.m.\n",

Comfortable silent is used frequently in Japanese conversation. It's the pauses within a speech that brings out the meaning of the words being spoken.\n\nJapanese culture reflects Ma in many ways:\n\n- The Japanese bow has a pause at the bottom to accentuate the meaning of the action\n- Arrangement of Japanese bonsai plants and flowers (ikebana)\n- Art of Japanese calligraphy (shodo)\n- Tatami tea rooms\n- Traditional Noh theatre, emphasizes what the actor isn't doing\n\nWhat are things in your life that you can remove to create more space?\n\n> ‘The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life… Keep only those things that speak to your heart.

The author recommends that anything that takes away your time should go into the log in chronological order.\n\nFor example, tasks or issues you worked on, code reviews you opened, meetings you attended (including notes), or research you do on new features.\n\nThis concept reminds me a lot of having a second brain.\n\nI would love an app that can help me effectively capture, organize, and easily access it for me when I need it.\n\nIt can help deal with the information overload I face when I read newsletters, watching YouTube or listening to podcast, or find something interesting on [curius](https://curius.app/).\n\nThere are some software ([mem.ai](https://get.mem.ai/) and [rewind.ai](https://www.rewind.ai/)) today that helps capture information effectively, organizes it for you, and makes it accessible when you need it.\n\nMaybe I'll build one myself.\n",

This often leads to uncovering new insights and connections that might not be apparent through mere reading or listening.\n- **Articulation**: Putting thoughts into words forces a person to clarify their understanding. This process of articulation helps in identifying areas where the understanding might be vague or incomplete.\n- **Reflection**: Writing allows for reflection on the subject matter, enabling the learner to connect new information with existing knowledge. This synthesis helps in creating a more robust and interconnected understanding of the subject.\n- **Revelation of Gaps**: Sometimes, the act of writing reveals areas where the knowledge is lacking or inconsistent. Recognizing these gaps is the first step towards filling them and achieving a more complete understanding.\n\nApply the feynman technique when writing:\n\n1. Choose a concept you want to learn about.\n2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student. Use simple language and avoid jargon\n3. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.\n4. Simplify and use analogies.\n5. Review and refine until you can explain it in the simplest way possible.\n",

Classics are classics for a reason.\n- Bring a pen with you too. Reading is better if you’re taking notes\n- Beat them up. Books are not precious things.\n- The whole point of reading is to really understand something. If all you’re after is the ‘gist,’ skip books and stick with blog posts.\n- Don’t just read books, re-read books. There’s a great line the Stoics loved—that we never step in the same river twice. The books don’t change, but you do.\n- Embrace serendipity. So many of my favorite books are just random things I grabbed at bookstores\n- “If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.”\n- \"Don’t be satisfied just getting the ‘gist’ of things,\" is what Marcus Aurelius learned from his philosophy teacher Rusticus.\n- When intelligent people read, they ask themselves a simple question: What do I plan to do with this information?\n- Look for wisdom, not facts. We’re not reading to just find random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? We’re reading to accumulate a mass of true wisdom—that you can turn to and apply in your actual life.\n",

Do you have a founder/market fit?: pick a good idea for my team!\n2. How big is the market?: ex: Coinbase\n3. How accute is the problem? ex: Brex\n4. Do you have competition?: Most good ideas have competition, but needs a new insight -> Yes I do\n5. Do you want this?: Do you know personally who wants this? -> I know someone who wants this, but I am not sure if I want this.\n6. Did this recently become possible or necessary? ex: Checkr\n7. Are there good proxies for this business? proxies is a large company that does something similar, but not a direct competitor. Rappi example.\n8. Is this an idea you'd want to work on for years?: boring idea is okay, and tend to be passionate over time.\n9. Is this a scalable business? Software -> check, high skilled human labor.\n10.

Quantify on a scale if desired\n- Visual focus\n  - Narrowing **visual attention** on a specific target increases **alertness and arousal**.\n    - recruits neurochemicals that increase focus, motivation, and perceived effort\n    - maintain focus on target for at least 30 secs, up to 90.\n- To maintain motivation\n  - take short breaks every 20 min or on the hour\n  - engage in panoramic vision by looking at horizon or corners of rooms help relax tired eyes and improve focus\n  - breathing properly and staying visually focused\n  - random intermittent reinforcement (i.e. in casinos), rewarding oneself randomly for completing milestones, enhances motivation\n- Dopamine <-> motivation\n  - dopamine is molecule of motivation\n  - rewarding oneself after each milestone diminishes reward potency\n  - Viewing accomplishment as the only reward undermines success probability\n  - You need to randomly reward yourself\n- middle problem\n  - motivation decrease during middle phase of goal pursuit\n  - break middle section into smaller chunks\n  - use tools like visual target to increase focus\n- Motivation throughout the day (circadian rhythm)\n  - Most people experience their highest level of attention and motivation 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking up.\n  - time block and engage in goal pursuit and don't worry about specific timings\n",

The only thing that sucks is I have GERD, so it really limits what I can make.\n\nI also cleaned the house a little and went to the gym.

    "content": "\nGitHub [built](https://github.blog/2023-02-06-the-technology-behind-githubs-new-code-search/?utm_source=theblueprint&curius=1433) a [code search engine](https://github.com/search?type=code&auto_enroll=true) from scratch in rust, called Blackbird.\n\nWhy not use an open source solution?\n\nBecause general text search products aren't great for _code_ search.\n\nThe UX is poor, indexing is slow, and it's expensive to host.\n\nHere were the three main motivations:\n\n1. A new UX for asking questions of code, and get answers through iteratively searching, browsing, navigating, and reading code\n2. Code is already designed to be understood by machines, so we should take advantage of that structure. It also has unique requirements; we want to search for punctuation, no stemming, keep stop words, and search with regex.\n3. Github scale is a unique challenge. Deploying on elasticsearch took months to index (8 mil repos). Today there are 200m. It's not static, and it's constantly changing. Right now, you can search **45 mil repos**, representing **115 TB of code** and **15.5b documents**.\n\n## just use grep\n\nIn programming, always start with what the naive approach; in this case, it's grep.\n\nLet's do a little napkin math.\n\nOn a machine with 8 core intel CPU, [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) can run an exhaustive regex query on a 13GB file cached in memory in 2.76 seconds.\n\nThis isn't going to work with the amount of data they have.\n\nCode search runs on 64 core, 32 machine clusters.\n\nEven if they put 115 TB of code in memory, assuming perfect parallelization of work, they're going to saturate 2,048 CPU cores for 96 seconds to serve a single query.\n\nAnd only that one query can run. This comes up to 0.01 queries per second (QPS).\n\nThere's no cost-effective way to scale this approach to all of Github's code.\n\nWe need to build an index.\n\n## Search index primer\n\nTo speed up queries, we need to pre-compute a bunch of information in the form of indices.\n\nThere are two indexing techniques: **forward and inverted index**.\n\nA [forward index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing#The_forward_index) stores a list of words for each document.\n\nAn [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) would be the opposite, mapping content to a set of documents that contain them.\n\nFor code search, they built a special type of inverted index called [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) index, useful for looking up substrings of content.\n\nTo perform a search, they intersect the results of multiple lookups to give the list of documents where the string appears. With a trigram index, there's four lookups for the query \"limits\" : `lim`, `imi`, `mit`, and `its`.\n\nUnlike a hashmap, these indices are too big to fit into memory.\n\nWe build **iterators** to lazily return sorted document IDs (based on ranking of each document) and we intersect and union the iterators and read far enough to fetch the requested number of results. This way they never have to keep the entire entire posting list.\n\n## Indexing 45 million repos\n\nwe have the technique, now to to figure out how to built the index efficiently.\n\nwe need to figure out some insights into the data we have which guides our approach.\n\nwe know two things: Git's use of [content addressable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage?useskin=vector) and that there's a lot of duplicate content on GitHub.\n\nThis leads us to two decisions:\n\n1. Shard by Git [blob](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) object ID.\n   - nice way to evenly distributed docs between shards while avoiding duplication.\n   - scale no. of shards as necessary\n2. Model index as tree\n   - use delta encoding to reduce amount of crawling and to optimize metadata\n   - metadata = list of locations for documents (path, branch, repo) and info about the objects (repo name, owner, visibility)\n\n## building the index\n\nTo ingest all the repositories for the first time, one key property is we **optimize the order** which we do the initial ingest to **make the most of delta encoding**.\n\nWe do this by using a novel probabilistic data structure representing repository similarity and by driving ingest order from a level order traversal of a MST of a graph of repository similarity.\n\nUsing this order, each repo is crawled by diffing it against its parent in the delta tree. This means we only need to crawl blobs unique to that repo, not the entire repo.\n\nHere's the process.\n\n1. Kafka provides events (`git push`) that tells us to index something.\n2. A bunch of crawlers interact with Git and a service to extract symbols from code.\n3. Kafka is used again to allow each shard to consume documents for indexing.\n4. The data is partitioned between shards. Each shard consumes a single Kafka partition in the topic.\n   - **Indexing is decoupled from crawling** through the use of Kafka and the **ordering** of messages in Kafka is how we gain **query consistency**.\n5. Indexer shards take the documents and build the indices\n   - tokenizing to construct n-gram indices (for content, symbols) and other useful indices (languages, owners, etc) before serializing and flushing to disk when enough work as accumulated.\n6. Finally the shards run compaction to collapse up smaller indices to larger onces that are more efficient to query.\n   - Compaction also k-merges the posting list by score so relevant documents have lower IDs and will be returned first by lazy iterators.\n\nDuring initial ingest, we delay compact and do one big run at the end, but then as index keeps up with incremental changes, compaction is run on shorter intervals to handle things like document deletion.\n\n## Life of a query\n\nRedis is used to **manage quotas** and **cache some access control data**.\n\n1. front end accepts user query and passes it to query service\n2. service parses query into abstract syntax tree and rewrites it\n   - resolves languages to canonical [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) language ID (determine what langauge it is)\n   - tags extra clauses for permissions and scopes\n3. Fan out and send n concurrent request\n   - query must be sent to each shard in search cluster due to sharding strategy\n4. Conversion of query to lookup information in indices\n   - regex gets translated into a series of substring queries on ngram indices\n   - [trigrams](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) are sweet spot in design space, but causes problems at scale. GitHub uses \"sparse grams\", a dynamic gram size.\n5. Iterators from each clause are run (and = intersect; or = union)\n   - returns a list of documents\n   - double check each document before scoring, sorting, and returning requested number of results\n6. Aggregate results from all shards\n   - resort by score, filter, return top 100\n7. Github.com front-end does syntax highlighting, term highlighting, pagination.\n\n```ruby\nand(\n  owners_iter(\"rails\"),\n  languages_iter(326),\n  or(\n    and(\n      content_grams_iter(\"arg\"),\n      content_grams_iter(\"rgu\"),\n      content_grams_iter(\"gum\"),\n      or(\n        and(\n         content_grams_iter(\"ume\"),\n         content_grams_iter(\"ment\")\n        )\n        content_grams_iter(\"uments\"),\n      )\n    ),\n    or(paths_grams_iter…)\n    or(symbols_grams_iter…)\n  ),\n  …\n)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is the entire system.\n\nThe ingest pipeline can publish 120k docs/s, so working through 15.5b should take 36 hours.\n\nDelta indexing reduces no of documents we have to crawl by 50%, allowing us to re-index entire corpus in 18 hours.\n\nWe started with 115 TB of content to search, deduplication and delta indexing brings that down to 28 TB of unique content. The index itself clocks in at 25 TB, which includes all the indices, and a compressed copy of all unique content.\n\n## Concept review\n\n- forward and inverted index: indices for for full-text search\n- [content addressable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage?useskin=vector): fetching something based on content.\n- [sharding](https://planetscale.com/blog/how-does-database-sharding-work): splitting large data across multiple clusters to scale horizontally\n- git [blob](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects): blob (binary large object), named by a SHA-1 hashing of size and contents of file.\n- [delta encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding?useskin=vector): storing data in form of deltas, storing only the differences\n- [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree?useskin=vector): a subset of edges of a connected, edge-weighted, undirected graph that connects all vertices together **without cycles** and with **minimum possible total edge weight**.\n- [k-merges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm?useskin=vector): merging k sorted arrays to produce a single sorted\n- compaction: collapse smaller indices to larger ones\n- [bitmask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10493411/what-is-bit-masking): data used for bitwise operation\n- Probabilistic data structures: [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash?useskin=vector) and [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog?useskin=vector)\n- Serializing: convert object state to byte stream\n- Flushing: sync temporary state of data with permanent state.\n- abstract syntax tree: tree-like data structure that represents the structure of source code in a programming language\n",

[Plant-based meat](https://gfi.org/plant-based/)\n\nWhat: [crafted](https://www.escoffier.edu/blog/world-food-drink/how-is-plant-based-meat-made/) using combination of plant ingredients that mimics taste, texture, and nutritional profile of meats. First, select protein-rich plants like soy, peas, or lentiles, which contain amino acids (essential building blocks of protein). Then to get the texture of meat, use heating, cooling, and pressure techniques to align the proteins in a way that resembles the fibrous structure of real meat. With texture down, now for the look and taste. [Processing, flavoring, fats, and natural colors](https://eatnowadays.com/blogs/crave-better-blog/what-is-plant-based-meat-made-of) are added, i.e. beet juice is used for the red \"meaty\" color, vegetable oil is added for the fat.\n\nGood\n\n- less greenhouse gas emissions\n  - 90% less beef\n  - 63% than pork\n  - 51% than chicken\n- less land and water\n- much lower levels of pollutants running from farms and into waterways\n\nBad\n\n- highly processed (high in sodium)\n- high in coconut oil (high in saturated fat -> heart disease)\n\n## 3.

This mimics the conditions within an animal's body, enabling cells to organize and form muscle fibers, the building blocks of meat. The cells continue to grow and differentiate to form the texture and composition of traditional meat.\n\nGood\n\n- same nutritional qualities as red meat\n\nBad\n\n- same health risk\n- requires biopsies of animals, when it ramps up, how many animals would be required?\n\n## Which is best?\n\nWhich is nutritionally superior?\n\nIf you care about your personal impact on animal welfare, public health, and the enviornment, plant-based meat comes out on top.\n\nSwitching to meat alternatives isn't an all-or-nothing decision.\n\n[A 2022 study](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/cutting-beef-out/12766) estimated forgoing red meat for one meal a day can **decrease your dietary carbon emissions by 48%**.\n\nSo start today.\n\nThere's [a lot you more can do](https://ed.ted.com/earth-school) than you think.\n",

The idea is to intentionally change the climate of the planet.\n\nBut it looks like we've been doing it this whole time time.\n\nWe've been haphazardly geo-engineering the planet by dumping a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere, decreasing the amount of heat that we can radiate back into space.\n\nWe also release a lot of Sulfur dioxide (SO2) when we burn dirty fuels like coal and fuel oil.\n\nIn a short period of time, **SO2 can decrease temperature** of an area of the planet.\n\nIt happens because it's good at seeding clouds, by combining with moisture in atmosphere to form droplets of sulfuric acid.\n\nThis creates **more and fluffier clouds**.\n\nThis happens when volcanoes erupt, and SO2 comes out. it can cool the planet with the dust and SO2.\n\nOne really big source of SO2 is the huge cargo ships that burn the cheapest oil which has a lot of SO2.\n\nAnd they produce ship tracks, which you can see from space. They are clouds by sulfur dioxide being spat out from these big ships.\n\nThe UN's IMO made a [new rule](https://zenodo.org/record/7864530) for [sulfur regulation](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn7988) in 2020.\n\nOver the last few years, [scientist found](https://www.science.org/content/article/changing-clouds-unforeseen-test-geoengineering-fueling-record-ocean-warmth) the warming of the ocean is attributed to **new light hitting it** that wouldn't normally be hitting it because of **less ship tracks**, and less dust from sahara.\n\nGlobal warming is **worse than we thought** it was because we were **shielded by the effects of other pollution** that we were throwing out in the air.\n\nThis is also good because it's a massive experiment that shows the effects of local geo-engineering on the atlantic ocean.\n\nInstead of using SO2, one way is to just shoot sea water into the air using [misters](https://www.emicontrols.com/en-us/) that make it super tiny so it can float in the air.\n\nMost of the water evaporates leaving behind little crystals of salt that then can seed clouds, and falls back down into the ocean.\n\nIt's going to get hot enough that we'll see marine extinction, humans dying from heat wave, etc.\n\nThe [3 things](https://youtu.be/dk8pwE3IByg?t=302) we can do:\n\n- Stop putting new CO2\n- Start taking old CO2 out of atmosphere\n- Deal with impact of current warming\n\nWe're in the overlap period, where problem is big enough where we can't ignore anymore, but we can still do things to solve it.\n",

Thankfully Atal aced the presentation.\n\nIn the end, we got the Social Good Shout out award.\n\nI really wanted the cash prize in the top 3, but looking at the other projects, they had a lot more technical implementation.\n\nIt was understandable since they consisted of young undergrads like me could not afford to sleep until they finished their app.\n\nOverall through Atal, I got to meet a lot of people.\n\nI'm glad I took the decision to reach out to people, because you never know what will happen.\n\nYou might end up coding for their team, and build a winning project.\n\nI got the chance to talk to CEOs and YC startup founders. It was great to have casual conversations with them. Only in SF can you talk to a CEO directly.\n\nI really want to be in SF when I graduate.\n\nThe energy here is insane.\n",

I realized I was left alone to build out the entire prototype.\n\nThroughout the 4 grueling hours, I had many disagreement and conflict with myself and others about what was possible and what wasn't. I let doubt and fear get to me at many points. I was afraid that time was not in our favor, and I will be left with an incomplete app, like my last hackathon.\n\nBut luckily, I persevered. Atal provided support with his brother, calling all the way from India, and we worked through the app together.\n\nOne thing led to another, I just kept coding and didn't sleep the whole night.\n\nI thought hard about what the UI should look like. It had to be readable and clean. I also worked on doing session states so that the app doesn't just refresh and remove all past data.\n\nAt break of day, I accomplished what we sought after.\n\nBut then, Atal came back with another idea of generating the entire petition letter. Scratching about 30 minutes of work.\n\nBut we found our selling point.\n\nWe were able to show Claude 2 generated a longer letter than GPT-4.\n\nAt that point, I could relax a little. Knowing I have done my part. I could rest for 30 minutes.\n\nI woke up confused.\n",

I knew what I wanted the code to look like.\n\nIt was a **conducive environment** because it was quiet, and there were no distractions.\n\nI broke the task into **smaller parts**, I worked on one function at a time.\n\nI didn't focus on reaching a flow state, it **happened naturally**.\n\nI was given a **deadline**, and that provided a boost of motivation to work on the task\n\n[Csíkszentmihályi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) identified 9 [components](https://tinyurl.com/2xkse9zh) for the flow experience\n\n- Intense and focused concentration on the present moment\n- A loss of reflective self-consciousness\n- A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity\n- A distortion of temporal experience, as one's subjective experience of time is altered\n- Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience\n- Immediate feedback\n- Feeling the potential to succeed\n- Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible\n",

That's equivalent to 3 of our largest nuclear reactors running 24/7\n- **Easy to create**: LK-99 material can be prepared in about 34 hrs with extremely basic lab equipment\n- **New reactor designs**: Nuclear fusion reactors rely on superconductors for plasma confinement. Modern designs use RBCO/YBCO superconductors cooled with LN2 or Liquid He, creating a huge temperature gradient and challenging operation.\n- **Room temperature quantum computers**: Quantum computers use superconductors to preserve coherence in qubits. Small changes in temperature and pressure can cause the entire QC to fail during operation.\n- **Superconductors batteries**: Simply inject a current and keep it in the coil until you need it. Previously, too costly to maintain.\n- **Ultra-efficient computer chips**: 0 resistive losses during operation with superconductors. No need for cooling fans\n- everything else: super-cheap MRI machines, MagLev trains everywhere, and a super efficient electric grid\n",

If you're going to copy something, **do it openly** instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously\n- Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work\n- **Danger to copying**: Tendency to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are\n- when you do copy something, **don't copy every feature** of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do.\n- the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.\n- One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to **copy something from one field into another**. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by **deliberately learning** about other kinds of work.\n- **Negative examples** can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing\n",

They might not have thought about your problem as much as you have.\n\nAnother skill is to be **willing to do gruntwork**, especially looking at data. Jason had to spend 40+ hours to do data labelling and validation.\n\nThe reality of research is a lot of hard work and drudgery, and it's an important part of the research process. It can help you build intuition about the research.\n\nThe final skill is being a **good communicator**.\n\nCommunicating well makes you more trustworthy to work with.\n\nDon't make promises you can't keep, be realistic about when you can meet deadlines and finishing tasks.\n\nBe specific when communicating blockers, instead of \"X doesn't work\", say \"X didn't work when I tried it using formulation F on model M using dataset D\" which decreases the _mental load_ of the other person.\n",

I've been to different doctors and tried different medications, I've come to believe I have no control. That this is my life now.\n\nI feel it's tricky with GERD.\n\nIf I believe I am in control, and I can cure GERD, I feel dissatisfied with my current situation. I think about all the things I'm not able to do and eat, and I yearn and long for the day I get to become this idealized version of myself without GERD.\n\nBut if I accept that it cannot change, and I adapt my lifestyle, and be content with becoming this different person, then I don't feel that dissatisfaction.\n\nBut I still want to cure GERD, it's a disease that's holding me back. I do not want to live with this for the rest of my life.\n\nHoping for change and practicing acceptance and focusing on the good of now feels like push and pull of a tidal wave.\n\nSome days the waves are crashing, and I sense there's hope again.\n\nOther days it gets bad and I feel the dread, fear, and the sinking feeling of being trapped in this weak and fragile state.\n\nPerhaps I just need to strike the right balance.\n\nThere are still things that are within my control.\n\nI need to focus on that.

    "content": "\nWith the progress of deep learning, there is now widespread use of AI technologies.\n\nWith that, comes with the propagation and amplification of biases and breach of user privacy.\n\nWhat if we could somehow make AI models \"forget\" the data it was trained on?\n\n[_Machine Unlearning_](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/06/announcing-first-machine-unlearning.html) is a subfield of ML that aims to remove the influence of specific subset of training examples (forget set) from a trained model.\n\nThe ideal unlearning algorithm would (1) **remove the influence** while (2) **maintaining accuracy** on the rest of training set and **generalization** to held-out examples.\n\nThe naive way is to retrain the model on a new dataset that excludes the samples from the forget set, but this can be computationally expensive.\n\nThe ideal algorithm will use the pre-trained model as a starting point, and **efficiently make adjustments** to remove the influence of the forget set.\n\n### Applications\n\nMU goes beyond protecting user privacy. It can:\n\n1. erase inaccurate/outdated information (due to errors in labelling or changes in environment)\n2. remove harmful, manipulated, or outlier data\n\nIt's also related to other areas of ML\n\n- [Differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy?useskin=vector): guarantee no particular training example has too large an influence on model (stronger goal compared to unlearning)\n- [life-long learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07569): models that can learn continuously while maintaining previously-acquired skills\n- [fairness](https://tinyurl.com/28g452mh): correct unfair biases or disparate treatment of members belonging to different groups\n\n### Anatomy\n\nAn unlearning algorithm takes a pre-trained model, and one or more samples from the forget set to unlearn.\n\nFrom the model, forget set, and retain set, the unlearning algorithm produces an **unlearned** model.\n\nThe goal: unlearned model === model trained without forget set\n\n### Challenges\n\nIt is complex as it involves several **conflicting objectives**:\n\n1. forgetting requested data\n1. maintaining model's utility (accuracy on retained and held-out data)\n1. efficiency\n\nExisting algorithms make different tradeoff\n\n- full retraining = forget ✅, utility ✅, efficiency ❌\n- adding noise to weights = forget ✅, utility ❌\n\nThe second challenge is the inconsistent **evaluation**.\n\n- [classification accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04933) on samples to unlearn\n- [distance](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wu20b.html) to fully retrained model\n- error rate of membership inference attacks as [metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09880) for [forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10981) [quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02205)\n\n### Challenge\n\nThe first [NeurIPS 2023 Machine Unlearning Challenge](https://unlearning-challenge.github.io/) was announced to advanced this field.\n\nA [starting kit](https://github.com/unlearning-challenge/starting-kit) and a sample [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/unlearning-challenge/starting-kit/blob/main/unlearning-CIFAR10.ipynb) is also released.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nHow is forgetting evaluated?\n\nUsing tools inspired by Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) such as [LiRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570).\n\nThey were first developed in privacy and security literature with the goal of inferring which **examples** were **part of the training set**.\n\nIntuitively, if unlearning was successful, there will be **no trace of the forget set**, causing MIA to fail; since the attacker will be _unable_ to infer the forget set was part of the original training set.\n\nIn addition, distribution of retrained models and unlearned models will be compared. For an ideal unlearned algorithm, the two will be indistinguishable.\n",

It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as busy as the ones most of us lead now, that won’t happen. We have to teach ourselves now to live, really live . . . to love the journey, not the destination.” - Anna Quindlen\n\n[A Short Guide to a Happy Life](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/100286) is short book with life lessons accompanied by lovely pictures.\n\nMy main takeaway is to not waste your days just existing, but to truly live by appreciating the little moments. To learn how to love the journey, but not the destination. To not take life for granted, but treat life like a terminal illness, a great gift, and then we'll start living life like we ought to live it.\n\nLessons and advice from the book\n\n- \"Don't ever confuse the two, your life and your work\"\n- \"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.\"\n- “Show up. Listen. Try to laugh.”\n- “You cannot be really good at your work if your work is all you are.”\n- “Turn off your cell phone. Keep still. Be present.”\n- “Get a life in which you are generous.”\n- “All of us want to do well, but if we do not **do good** too then doing well will never be enough.”\n- “Knowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God gives us.” It is so easy to exist rather than to live… Unless you know a clock is ticking.\n- “Think of life as a terminal illness.”\n",

Current retry: %s.\", file_name, retries)\n...\n```\n\nHere are the [challenges](https://medium.com/@ArzelaAscoli/writing-professional-python-logs-e1f31635b60b) of logging this way.\n\n- **missing contextual info**, the above log might be enough for a dev environment with one user, but in a production system, questions that can arise are:\n  - Who sent this request?\n  - Which organization does the user belong to?\n  - Which file store did we connect to? Is there a session identifier or something else that helps us trace down the error?\n  - Is this log line connected to a request identifier?\n- **transition** from dev only to machine readable logs\n  - logs should not only human-readable, but also machine readable in production system for easier querying\n- **inconsistent** wording\n  - dependent on author, different naming convention, missing information\n\nIntroducing [structlog](https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/)\n\n> Structlog offers a lot of nice features that help you write logs in a faster and less painful way. It helps you to add contextual data to your logger and offers a modular configuration for parsing your log lines in a machine readable and developer friendly way.\n\nSummary of learnings\n\n- a key-value format for variables creates standardizes log messages and naming convention\n- contextual data are added explicitly by binding variables or implicitly by using [context variables](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html), enriching logs with useful metadata\n- structlog preprocessor extends content of log messages and renderer allows easy parsing of logs into machine/human-friendly format\n\n[Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) is another library that makes logging enjoyable.\n",

It was my ticket into the Bay Area. So it holds a special place in my heart.\n\nMy most recent hack - [ClassGPT](https://github.com/benthecoder/ClassGPT) was using the ChatGPT API for document question answering on my class lecture slides.\n\nEven though there was no prize involved, and there were dozens of other apps that did something similar, I had so much fun building it.\n\nIt was my own app in the corner of the internet. I could say I built it from scratch. I could share it with my friends and have them test it out.\n\nI wanted to put it out into the world and show others what I was capable of. So I posted it on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benedictneo_classgpt-chatgpt-for-class-lectures-with-activity-7037663043819884544-RJfF) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benthecoder1/status/1631893511220916225?s=20) and they became my most popular posts ever.\n\nPeople even reached out to me and even offered me internships.\n\nIt made me realize how important it is to launch side projects.\n\nIt projects who I am and how I spend my time.\n\nThey demonstrate I'm someone who can generate output.\n\nWith LLMs, coding a new side project has never been easier.\n\nHaving ideas is easy, but execution is hard.\n\nI hope to continue building, and devote time to launching.\n\nSome quotes I want to come back to:\n\n> It’s a massive differentiator to have launched something\n>\n> it’s becoming increasingly obvious that projects - launched, defined, things - are currency\n>\n> To build and make things rather than reposting others work\n>\n> Get out of your feed. Make your own feed. Put something new out there. Launch something. Don’t worry about the form or function.\n>\n> Put something out into the world that is yours. That allows you to demonstrate what you’re capable of. Keep it weird. Keep it yours. And if you don’t, someone else will.\n",

For skilled players, Blackjack offers the best odds, potentially allowing professional players to win \\$1.50 to \\$3 per \\$100 from the casino.\n- Memorizing a basic strategy chart in Blackjack can minimize loss to around 60 cents per a hundred dollars.\n- Card counting in Blackjack involves tracking face cards and aces. More aces mean a higher chance of hitting blackjack, while more face cards increase the chance of the dealer busting.\n- The Martingale algorithm, which doubles your bet after every loss, is generally ineffective due to table limits.\n- In Craps, the follow-on bets offer even odds, allowing prolonged play without losing money.\n- In Poker, the best strategy is to be highly skilled and play against less skilled players with a lot of money to lose.\n- Roulette is generally impossible to win consistently due to the casino's edge, though some older casinos with unbalanced wheels could have exploitable biases.\n\n**Casino Policies and Technology:**\n\n- Casinos tend not to kick players out for winning, banking on the law of large numbers for eventual profit. However, if a player is identified as a professional with an edge, the casino can eject them using trespassing laws.\n- In New Jersey, casinos can't kick players out but can ruin the game for them by putting the cut cards at the front, making card counting impossible.\n- Casinos may use RFID embedded chips to track player betting and identify anomalies, possibly flagging certain players for observation.\n\n**Psychology and Gambling:**\n\n- The thrill of winning often outweighs the pain of losing for true gamblers, driving them to continue gambling.\n\n**Slot Machines:**\n\n- Slot machines are labor-efficient and major revenue generators for the casino, with adjustable odds ranging from 80% to 99% payout.\n- Progressive slot machines increase the potential payout as players lose, with optimal play possible when the bank is above a certain level.\n\n**Monte Carlo Simulation and Statistical Concepts:**\n\n- Each game has a different edge calculated through Monte Carlo simulations, where millions of hands are simulated to calculate expected wins or losses.\n- The concepts of expected value and the law of large numbers underpin casino games' outcomes, with every hand being independent, illustrating the \"hot hand fallacy.\"\n- Splitting aces and eights in Blackjack provides higher winning odds according to Monte Carlo simulations.\n",

You can be activated or calm.\n\nYour brain is telling itself a story about what is going on inside your body in relation to what's happening in the world.\n\nIt's creating this story using knowledge about emotion from your past to predict what you're going to see, and hear and feel.\n\nThat's what emotion is.\n\nIt's also an explanation of every thought, feeling, and action.\n\nThe main takeaway I got is that **emotions do not happen to you**, they're created based on our past experiences.\n\nAnother way to say this is emotions form based on our interpretations and expectations.\n\nKnowledge of a past event is fed to the brain which predict how we're supposed to feel, when we a similar event in the present.\n\nWe also have more **control of your emotions** that you think.\n\nLisa talks about cultivating new experiences as a way to change our emotions.\n\nWatch movies, learned something new, do things that require you to have different experiences that gets you outside of the normal range of what your brain will predict.\n\nWe're the only ones who can change our emotions.\n\nAnd we always have tools at our disposal to feel differently and act differently.\n",

Emotional exhaustion - richer than physical, it's not just being tired, it's the feeling you cannot handle one more thing on your plate or it'll all fall apart.

I'd argue it is the # of **high quality teams**. A high quality team is 2-4 smart people who know each other well, have at least 1 technical founder, and are all serious about doing a startup.\n- **Startups are not a thinking game, they are a doing game**.\n  - If you don't have good startup ideas now, the way to get better ones isn't to think really hard, it's to build stuff and launch it and learn from what happens.\n  - Building and launching your own products, end-to-end, is especially important experience to have. **Building software at large companies means tweaking features of large existing products. That's a very different skill from launching your own stuff**.\n- Do it **first thing after you graduate**\n  - Why? You don't have to quit anything to do a startup when you graduate. And if it doesn't work out, it just becomes your first job.\n  - dropping out should be an edge case. only do it if you're not liking school or your project takes off.\n  - working for a few years first has a downside: it'll be harder to convince your college friends then, they'll have settled into their job or moved.\n- Startups >>> big tech\n  - choose a startup; you'll learn more relevant skills, pick up startup culture, and meet other people who are more interested in startups.\n  - more ex-Stripe founders were funded than ex-Google founders in recent YC batch, despite the fact that Google has 27 times as many employees as Stripe.\n- Apply for YC\n  - How much traction? None. Most of the companies YC funds are idea stage or prototype stage.\n  - No visa issues at YC, great for international students\n\nMore on PG's [blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html).\n",

    "content": "\nAn idea from the book \"101 Things I learned in Engineering School\".\n\n> **Electrical systems** are protected by fuses or circuit breakers that trip before a power surge can ruin expensive components or damage hard-to-access wires.\n>\n> In **steel buildings**, connections between structural members can be designed to deform during earthquakes, to prevent catastrophic failure of the larger system. Repair of the connections can be done at a fraction fo the cost of replacing the entire building.\n>\n> **Biomedical devices** are often connected loosely to protect a patient. A pulse oximeter, used to detect blood oxygenation, is connected to a patient's finger with deliberate weakness, preventing injury should someone trip over the cable.\n>\n> The clips that hold **lobster traps** together are designed to corrode after one fishing season. When traps are lost or abandoned, the clips will fail before the wire-gridded sides, leaving the pieces that are much less hazardous to boats than a pile of submerged boxes.\n\nIn my head I'm thinking, were these only discovered after the failures happened?\n\nAnd engineers were working backwards from the problem, and figuring out a solution?\n\nAnd through trial-and-error, realize that a circuit breaker was needed?\n\nOr did they have enough knowledge about the system beforehand and discovered a failsafe was required?\n\nIn coding, writing tests is a similar philosophy. You write code where you expect failures to happen, and that increases it's reliability.\n\nThis concept can be applied to our lives.\n\nIf we can plan our lives while expecting that failure is a possibility, we can avoid expensive mistakes.\n\nIf we set high expectations for ourselves, without accounting for failure, without deliberate weakness in the design, it will cause mental injuries.\n\nBut what's the definition of failure?\n\nIs failures = not meeting expectations?\n\nIs the key to not setting expectations in the first place?\n\nAre expectations just disappointments waiting to happen?\n\nDesign your life to fail.\n\nSo when failure comes, you're ready to face it.\n",

    "content": "\n> There is an old Eastern fable about a traveler who is taken unawares on the steppes by a ferocious wild animal. In order to escape the beast the traveler hides in an empty well, but at the bottom of the well he sees a dragon with its jaws open, ready to devour him. The poor fellow does not dare to climb out because he is afraid of being eaten by the rapacious beast, neither does he dare drop to the bottom of the well for fear of being eaten by the dragon.\n>\n> So he seizes hold of a branch of a bush that is growing in the crevices of the well and clings on to it. His arms grow weak and he knows that he will soon have to resign himself to the death that awaits him on either side.\n>\n> Yet he still clings on, and while he is holding on to the branch he looks around and sees that two mice, one black and one white, are steadily working their way round the bush he is hanging from, gnawing away at it. Sooner or later they will eat through it and the branch will snap, and he will fall into the jaws of the dragon. The traveler sees this and knows that he will inevitably perish.\n>\n> But while he is still hanging there he sees some drops of honey on the leaves of the bush, stretches out his tongue and licks them. In the same way I am clinging to the tree of life, knowing full well that the dragon of death inevitably awaits me, ready to tear me to pieces, and I cannot understand how I have fallen into this torment.\n>\n> And I try licking the honey that once consoled me, but it no longer gives me pleasure. The white mouse and the black mouse – day and night – are gnawing at the branch from which I am hanging. I can see the dragon clearly and the honey no longer tastes sweet. I can see only one thing; the inescapable dragon and the mice, and I cannot tear my eyes away from them. And this is no fable but the truth, the truth that is irrefutable and intelligible to everyone.\n>\n> The delusion of the joys of life that had formerly stifled my fear of the dragon no longer deceived me. No matter how many times I am told: you cannot understand the meaning of life, do not thinking about it but live, I cannot do so because I have already done it for too long. Now I cannot help seeing day and night chasing me and leading me to my death. This is all I can see because it is the only truth. All the rest is a lie.\n>\n> Those two drops of honey, which more than all else had diverted my eyes from the cruel truth, my love for my family and for my writing, which I called art – I no longer found sweet.\n>\n> ― Leo Tolstoy, A Confession and Other Religious Writings\n\nPastor Kieth shared this at the service at Renewal today for his sermon about life.\n\nIt's pessimistic view of life, about how the chasing and indulging in the pleasures of life is not sustainable, and the honey will not taste sweet any longer.\n\nTrue meaning comes from living out God's purpose, and loving others the way God loves us.\n",

That's 1.3 billion tons of food that either never leaves the farm, gets lost or spoiled during distribution, or are thrown away.\n\nFood waste is an environmental issue too.\n\nWasting food = wasting energy and water it took to grow, harvest, transport, and package.\n\nAnd food that goes to landfill produces methane when it rots.\n\n6-8% of human-caused greenhouse gas can be reduced if food waste is stopped.\n\nIn the US, 32.6 million cars worth of GG emission is generated from food waste.\n",

They were commending the taste and the price of the char siu.\n\n\"7 dollars for this is a good deal, you won't get this in Malaysia\"\n\nWe walked down to the dim sum place and got shrimp and chive dumplings, egg tarts, steamed and baked pork buns.\n\nI liked the egg tarts the most, it reminded me of the ones from home. Everything else was standard.\n\nWe went into the park at past 4 and everything was unfortunately closing.\n\nIt was also very windy and my parents were suffering from the cold.\n\nI got clam chowder to warm them up.\n\nWe gave up trying to walk through the park and went back to the car.\n\nI drove down to the windmills, we took some pictures.\n\nI went to see the American bison next. They're huge in person.\n\nI planned to go Twin Peaks to catch the sunset but that wasn't happening.\n\nWe ended up going to Japantown for ramen.\n\nI finally got to try Marufuku Ramen.\n\nThere was a 50 minute waitlist upon arriving past 7.\n\nSo we killed time finding something at Chameleon Vintage.

    "content": "\nMy parents picked me up at my airbnb to have have leftover Claypot rice from Koi Palace at their airbnb.\n\nI brought my MacBook along to plan the day.\n\nMy plan was as followed.\n\nOld Fisherman's Wharf -> Cannery Row -> 17 Mile Drive.\n\nI was excited to drive down to Monterey.\n\nBut since I've only racked up a couple of hours driving in the US, it was intimidating as well.\n\nOne thing I noticed about the freeways is how easy it is to exit to a different lane when you're on the most right lane. Some of them are really subtle, and it's easy to exit on accident.\n\nAlso, my parents kept asking me to slow down at a 65 speed limit freeway. Cars around me were going 80-90 so it was hard to stick to 65.\n\nWe arrived at 2 p.m. I paid for 2 hours of parking with the Park Mobile app, and walked to the wharf.\n\nMy mom got distracted by some flea markets selling trinkets on the way.\n\nInitial impression of the wharf: it looks like a mini SF Pier 39. There was less crowd, and more boats around the wharf, just sitting on the ocean.\n\nWe got a $14 bread bowl Clam Chowder. We sat on a bench and all of us started munching it. It warmed up our tummies.\n\nAfter that we went into some shops, and got 2 scoops of homemade ice cream on the way back to the car.\n\nNext stop was Cannery Row.\n\nIt was a nice street, with restaurants and gift shops around.\n\nI saw a statue of John Steinbeck, and started seeing him on street pole banners, then found out he wrote a book about Cannery Row.\n\nWalking down the street to the end brought us to the aquarium.\n\nI looked up the Antique mall and found out it closing in 45 minutes. I rushed my parents to get to that place in time.\n\nI really loved the Antique mall. It was two floors filled with antiques owned by over 100 local dealers. I could totally spend at least 2 hours there. I looked at some vintage posters, saw an atari game console, vintage hot wheels, old t-shirts, and a bunch of other stuff. The whole time I figuring out what I could snatch for my apartment back in Iowa.\n\nWith 5 minutes left until closing, I had to get something. I frantically hunted for clothes, and managed to thrift a thick Rock Oil racing white sweater and a Flaming Santa Cruz black t-shirt.\n\nNext, we went to the Lighthouse bookstore.\n\nMy mom bought a cooking book. I read some poetry.\n\nIt was dinner time.\n\nSea harvest was the closest restaurant. We were cold and hungry.\n\nI got two plates of grilled seafood. We chose sea bass and salmon.\n\nIt was my first time trying sea bass. I was surprised at its richness in fats. The salmon was cooked to perfection. The rice that came with it also tasted good.\n\nIt was already 8pm, 17-mile drive can happen another day.\n\nBefore leaving, I wanted to drive along the coast.\n\nWe stopped at Perkins park and admired the wide bed of purple flowers, and the ocean crashing on the rocks.\n\nI drove further down and saw some people sitting at the beach, with a campfire in the middle.\n\nI got out and took some pictures.\n\nIt was getting dark.\n\nWe said goodbye to Monterey.\n",

You're giving in? No animosity? You're not secretly hoping that maybe they'll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?\"\n- The flipside is bad too, if you're outarguing the person, you're nuking the relationship\n",

For some reason, Singapore has better pastries than Malaysia.\n\nMy favorite pastries are the [Wife Cakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_cake?useskin=vector) 老婆餅, the flaky pastries filled with winter melon and coconut, and [Bean Paste Pastry](https://www.chinatownology.com/bean_paste_pastry.html) 豆沙饼 (the savory one 咸).\n\nI also took dim sum in Malaysia for granted. It used to be everywhere.\n\nI did some research for an hour and found a couple dim sum places and bakeries.\n\nDim Sum\n\n- Good Mong Kok Bakery (long-line)\n- Wong Lee Bakery (same owner as above, same food, no line)\n- other options: house of Dim Sum / delicious Dim Sum\n\nBakeries\n\n- Eastern Bakery\n- Yummy Bakery (egg tart)\n- Garden Bakery\n- AA Bakery at Stockton & Jackson\n- Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Company\n\nI first got to try Eastern Bakery.\n\nI got the egg tart, wife cake, and Bean Paste Pastry.\n\nThe egg tart was really good, the custard creamy and rich, and exploded in flavor.\n\nThe latter two however, was greasy and soft and too sweet for me. They did not, at all, resemble the pastries I was fond of.\n\nThen we queued for dim sum at Good Mong Kok Bakery.\n\nThe line wasn't bad, we waited around 25 minutes.\n\nWe got:\n\n- shredded coconut bun (extremely sweet)\n- baked BBQ pork bun (too much bread and filling was mid)\n- steamed Pork Bao (like above, too much bun)\n- malaysian sponge cake (just taste like sweet bread)\n- turnip cakes (Good texture and taste, but some sauce would be nice)\n- wife cake (haven't tried TBD)\n- shrimp dumpling (good generous, mouthful size)\n- siu mai (steamed pork dumplings) - strong pork flavor, I loved it.\n\nThe plan was to go Portsmouth Square, and find a place to eat.\n\nBut it was super loud and crowded, so we went to St Mary's Square instead.\n\nAfter some dim sum we went to Union Square.\n\nWe went into Nike store, tried the AirMax 90, 97, and dunks. I copped the Mica Green Nike Dunk Lows at a good price because of a 15% app deal and 6% Apple Card cashback.\n\nWe also got distracted by the Apple Store and admired the 14-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nThen we went to Westfield mall to visit some more shoes stores.\n\nI ate some leftover dim sum, game some to a homeless guy, and took the 6:16 train back home.\n",

Our minds easily twist the good into bad, and we avoid the bad and sweep it under the rug, even though they can teach us important life lessons and help us grow.\n\nWhat I took away from this is emotions, both good and bad, should be shared with the people you love, and when emotions are shared, they become simpler.\n",

There should be another layer between natural language and code generation, could be training set, prompting, a new language.\n- Compute services have a very low operating margin, 70% of it go to AWS or GCP\n- cons of consulting, you might get assigned a project that is boring, and the work never goes to production\n- in the Philippines there's an army class that you take where you march and learn how to hold a gun\n- Facebook data scientists work on mostly SQL\n- Developer advocate works on community-building, workshops, conferences, writing blogs, sometimes code, and salary can be 150k/year fresh grad, but they force you to write certain contents\n- companies start out with analytics, use snowflake, then realize they want to do machine learning, they get recommended low code ML solutions (Dataiku)\n",

    "content": "\nThe friends I made last summer aren't back at Tesla yet, so it's a weird feeling being back again but not having them around.\n\nIt's like starting a new semester at college but with all your friends graduated and already long gone.\n\nLast summer my team also had a lot of interns, and we would grab lunch together. These days I'm thinking hard about who I can get lunch with.\n\nHowever, with change comes new opportunity for growth and for meeting new people. Since I no longer have the same friends that I stick with, I'm forced to go out of my comfort zone and talk to strangers.\n\nThis week, I got to meet some interns from the SWE team at the cafe, and had lunch with an intern on my team. I like talking to strangers, I never know what I can learn from them. It's like the box of chocolates saying.\n\nGrowing up in Malaysia, taking the initiative to talk to strangers does not come natural to me.\n\nIt feels like I'm going against my own nature, physically and emotionally.\n\nI tried it today, I sat down waiting for the shuttle bus, and wanted to strike up conversation with the person beside me.\n\nI was actively searching for a common ground to start a conversation. I looked at his phone, it was worn out at the edges. Do I start with, \"Hey what happened to your phone?\" What if that's too personal I thought, would it come off personal or too out-of-the-blue? I then looked at his shoes. No nothing to ask there it was regular boots. What if I directly ask what team he belongs to? No that's way to early in a conversation with a stranger to bring up.\n\nI thought about it for so long that eventually the shuttle came.\n\nIn my mind I'm thinking, because of my overthinking, I missed the opportunity to network with this person, who could've fed me a new piece of information, or connected me with another person, both of which could've changed the course of my life.\n\nI went in the shuttle, want to the very last row, and sat beside a chinese guy in his mid 20s.\n\nI've seen him before at the office.\n\nSo for 30 seconds, I sat down thinking whether I should tell him directly. I can feel my heart racing. A clock ticking down.\n\nI was thinking, \"Gosh is it too late to say it now, I've already sat down for so long, it's going to be awkward\"\n\nThen, I just decided to take the plunge.\n\n\"Hey, I think I've seen you at the office before\"\n\nHe goes \"Yea, I think so too\", and says he's at the first floor.\n\nWe start talking about the team we work for, I mentioned I was a returning intern. He started going on about how Tesla is a good company that can bring lots of opportunities, about how his friends got to other companies with Tesla on their resume.\n\nWe both connected when we shared the same frustration for the IT department, and how messy things are.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I found out his name was Ben too, like me. We both were animated and exchanged contacts.\n\nI left the shuttle smiling.\n\nI love the moments where you can connect with another person, when both parties have something to relate to, and surprising little moments like having the same name.\n\nI aim to focus less on the anxiety of the infinite amount of possibilities from talking to strangers, and more on the opportunity of making genuine connections.\n\nHopefully by the end of the summer, I'll be more comfortable with serendipitous conversations with strangers.\n",

She began explaining that she was the one communicating with me on Airbnb messages.\n\nI was a little embarrassed, since my first day here I was overwhelmed, so I said some things how there were 9 rooms in the apartment and I wasn't comfortable staying here. I also shortened my stay on the first day itself.\n\nI was about to heat up my $9 bento box from 99 ranch for dinner but saw her moving a chair into the house and I went to help her.\n\nWe got to the age-old \"where you are from\" question and I blurted out Mandarin once she mentioned she was from China.\n\nI usually try to keep conversations in English. Even back at university, I wouldn't converse in mandarin with a Chinese, because it usually backfires when I fail to express myself due to my primary school level of Chinese vocabulary.\n\nShe asked if I needed anything, and I asked about the red bicycle that's been sitting the living room the past five days I have been here, untouched and unmoved.\n\nShe mentioned it was a girl's bike, but she could lend me a bike that belonged to her nephew at her house nearby.\n\nShe said to give her 20 minutes, and we can go check on the bike together.\n\nIt was already 7:30pm, and I was getting hungry, but I couldn't turn down this opportunity.\n\nWhat I initially thought would be a 5 minute thing turned out to be over an hour, we went to two separate houses. After discovering the bike had a flat tire at the first house, we moved the bike to a second house to get an air pump, but the pump we found at a shed was a ball pump. So we ended up leaving the bike there, and headed back to bring me home.\n\nIn the car, I got to know her a little better.\n\nShe moved here from China with her only daughter in 2017, and has been in California since. \"Time flies\" she said. She's an art teacher, and that influenced her daughter to study art therapy. Apparently, there are only 42 universities that offer this. She expressed her dissatisfaction about the daughter's choice of career path, but was understanding given that's her interest.\n\nWe also talked about my major, living cost in Iowa, whether I wanted to buy a car that she was selling for 2k, about my parents visiting, what my dad does, about durian being really expensive in California (~10 dollars per pound), and $60 in China.\n\nShe asked me about layoffs and AI, and my brain's english to chinese translation feature wasn't working very well, but I think she got some idea of what I was saying.\n\nEven though we both have completely different backgrounds and upbringing, we had a shared understanding of what it's like to be far away from home, and the struggles of starting a life somewhere new.\n\nI like this part about Airbnbs.\n\nYou get to meet different people from all walks of life and realize we're all just the same underneath.\n",

I was really close to getting an offer with Glassdoor, but they ended up going with a graduate student.\n\nI had no other options.\n\nI signed the offer letter to go back as an intern, and I felt no emotion at all. I told myself that I failed.\n\nIt felt like I made the wrong decision at that time. The entire Spring semester I wasn't looking forward to coming back.\n\nBut now that I'm here, I'm glad to be back.\n\nIt's only been 5 days and I've already met so many new people, explored new places\n\nMy parents are visiting too and I'm really excited.\n\nAnd all this wouldn't be possible if I were somewhere else.\n\nIt's funny how life works. It never goes the way you expect it to be.\n\nI worked so hard to escape what I thought was not the right for me, as if I knew what I wanted.\n\nInstead of trying to control how I want my life to be like, which causes a lot of unnecessary anxiety and disappointment. I'm optimizing now to just have fun, and take small steps towards what I like doing.\n\nThis summer will be exciting.\n",

    "content": "\nLearning to write more Pythonic code is one of my goals.\n\nToday we're learning about the `@property` decorator from this excellent [blog post](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/properties#what-is-the-error-message-%E2%80%9Cproperty-of-object-has-no-setter%E2%80%9D).\n\n## What is a property?\n\n> property is the Pythonic interface for adding dynamic behaviour to your interactions with attributes in classes.\n\nKnowing the what isn't very helpful without any context, let's answer the why.\n\n## Why properties?\n\nLet's say you create a Person class, and you want an attribute that returns the first and last name.\n\n```py\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, first, last):\n        self.first = first\n        self.last = last\n        self.name = f\"{self.first} {self.last}\"\n\njohn = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")\njohn.name # 'John Doe'\n```\n\nEverything might look fine, but there's an issue here.\n\n```py\njohn.last = \"Smith\"\njohn.name # 'John Doe'\n```\n\nChanging the `last` attribute did not update our `name` attribute, they're out of sync.\n\nYou could decide to create two methods: `set_first` and `set_last`, and update them that way, but it's not very Pythonic.\n\nAnother alternative, is a method that computes the name attribute on demand.\n\n```py\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, first, last):\n        self.first = first\n        self.last = last\n\n    def get_name(self):\n        return f\"{self.first} {self.last}\"\n\njohn = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")\njohn.get_name() # 'John Doe'\njohn.first = \"Charles\"\njohn.get_name() # 'Charles Doe'\n```\n\nBut there's an elegant solution, a pythonic way of writing name as an attribute itself.\n\nThat's properties!\n\n```py\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, first, last):\n        self.first = first\n        self.last = last\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return f\"{self.first} {self.last}\"\n\njohn = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")\njohn.name # 'John Doe'\njohn.last = \"Smith\"\njohn.name # 'John Smith'\n```\n\nThe main use case of property is when you have an attribute that depends dynamically on something else.\n\nIn our previous example, we had name depend on two attributes.\n\nin the `pathlib` module, you'll see @property in action as well\n\n```py\n# datetime.py, Python 3.11\nclass PurePath(object):\n    # ...\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        \"\"\"The final path component, if any.\"\"\"\n        parts = self._parts\n        if len(parts) == (1 if (self._drv or self._root) else 0):\n            return ''\n        return parts[-1]\n\nfrom pathlib import PurePath\np = PurePath(\"~/Documents/readme.md\")\np.name # 'readme.md'\n```\n\n## When to use property?\n\n- the value can be computed **fast**\n- the value is a piece of data intrinsically **associated** with the instance we are talking about\n- the value is a **simple** piece of data. (not common to see a property that returns complex data structures)\n\nThere's more to properties, you can make attributes read only by adding an underscore in front of variables to hide them, and create properties for them.\n\nThere's also property setters and deleters, which let's you directly assign attributes and to clean up other attributes that are auxiliary to the main property attribute.\n\nAlso @property apparently isn't a decorator, but a [descriptor](https://tushar.lol/post/descriptors/), which lets you customize the behavior getter/setter/deleter methods.\n\nThat's all for today.\n",

    "content": "\nIt was my second time trying out golfing at Top Golf today.\n\nI hit ~80 shots, and only a handful were good.\n\nTowards the end, my hands were starting to sore and all my shots were bad.\n\nYou need a firm grip and a stable swing, and I don't think my arms are strong enough, my golf club kept moving around.\n\nI also think I'm not tall enough. I was using the hybrid club and had to hold it in an awkward position, and it kept hitting my arm.\n\n_Update: It's the day after I wrote this and arms and shoulders are sore and my grip is weak._\n\nSome good tips I got for golfing are:\n\n- don't look where the ball goes as you're hitting it\n- bend your knees, loosen your shoulders and relax, I found taking a breath before each shot helped\n- bend your club towards where you want to hit, it helps direct the shot\n- don't charge for the shot at the start and hit like an axe, it should be a single circular motion that flows like water\n- focus on your grip and stance, then work on other things\n- focus on hitting the bottom of the ball\n\nHere's what each club does in golf\n\n## Woods\n\n> 1W - your main driver...typical loft is 9 degrees up to 15. These used to be actual wood, but now are getting more bulky, and are all metal.\n>\n> 3W - your fairway driver...hard club to master. Used for long par 4s or par 5 second shots.\n>\n> 5W - lofted to around 16-19 degrees. Can be used in the rough, hits a little shorter than > your 3W, and has a more shallow swingplane.\n\n## Hybrids\n\n> These are clubs that will look and feel like a hybrid between an iron and wood. They have no cavity back (empty back like an iron), but stand straighter up at address and have more loft. Hybrids have the same lofts as many of the irons, but give more consistency, strength, and ease of hitting the ball in the air than their iron counterpart. They are popular for hitting out of rough because of their ability to slide into the ball and not catch the grass behind the ball (this causes a flyer or a ball hit further than needed with little spin because the grass covers the grooves). They are also popular for seniors or women, but not exclusively. Kind of cool clubs and relatively new.\n\n## Irons\n\n> 1 - nobody can hit this. Not even God. Don't know why I'm even including it.\n>\n> 2-4 - your long irons. Shallow face, not as much loft. You can hit these farther, and with > less backspin. They are typically used for distances on the fairway, anywhere from 180-240 to the green.\n>\n> 5-8 - your mid irons. More loft, used to hit from 130-180 yards out from the green. More > spin, and higher trajectory.\n>\n> 9, PW, GW, AW, SW - your short irons and wedges. 9 iron and PW are your clubs from 130 in. > Gap wedge is a wedge between your pitching and sand wedges. Auxiliary is a specialty wedge > that you could honestly make any loft. Sand wedge is for bunkers, or if you feel > comfortable with it, chipping and flop shots.\n\n## Putter\n\n> No explanation necessary, although there are different types of putters. An offset (referring to where the shaft meets the head) teardrop (shape) putter is a popular one.\n",

You cast it and catch 80 fishes out of the 100. That's 80% recall. However, you also catch 80 rocks in the process, that's 50% precision.\n\nYou can use a smaller net, and target a pocket of the lake with only fish and no rocks, but you only get 20 of the fish, but no rocks. That's 20% recall and 100% precision.\n\nGet the idea?\n\nRecall = what proportion of the things you catch are actually fish (true). (ex1: 80 / 100)\n\nPrecision = of those you catch, what proportion are fish. (ex1: 80 / 80 + 80)\n\nTo balance between these two metrics, we optimize the [F1 score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score), which is their [harmonic mean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harmonic_mean).\n\nHowever, in some cases, precision would be more important than recall, and vice versa.\n\nHere's where the [F Beta](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score#F%CE%B2_score) scofe comes in handy.\n\nWe can adjust the value of Beta to assign higher weight to either precision or recall.\n\nBelow is a [toy example](https://github.com/MenaWANG/ML_toy_examples/blob/main/modeling%20algorithm/metrics-fbeta.ipynb).\n\n```py\nfrom sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score\n\n# define two models\ny_true           = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # half positive\ny_pred_precision = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # perfect precision, two false negatives\ny_pred_recall    = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] # perfect recall, three false positives\n\nperfect_precision = [y_true, y_pred_precision]\nperfect_recall    = [y_true, y_pred_recall]\n\n# the two models score similarly when beta = 1\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=1))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=1))\n\n# higher perfect precision scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=0.5))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=0.5))\n\n# higher perfect recall scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=2))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=2))\n\n```\n\nThe [beta parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) determines the weight of recall in the combined score.\n\nbeta < 1 lends more weight to precision, while beta > 1 favors recall (beta -> 0 considers only precision, beta -> +inf only recall).\n",

    "content": "\n> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler\n\nSome notes on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qKv5TBaOA) on essential coding topics to help me become a better programmer.\n\n## #1 Not using programming standards\n\nThere are [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) to follow in writing code such as whitespacing, file structure, and naming to make code consistent and readable.\n\nIt's especially important when working with other people, as it allows everyone to rely on shared expectations.\n\nNot keeping standards is like switching fonts all the time, you can still read it but the differences can throw people off.\n\n## #2 Not learning programming principles\n\nProgramming [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles) guide you into becoming a better programmer. They're like raw philosophies of code.\n\n[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is an acronym for five design principles intended to make OOP more maintainable.\n\n- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle\n  - aim to break code down into modules of one responsibility each, it's more code, but you can test it more cleanly and use parts of it elsewhere\n- **O**pen/Closed Principle\n  - design modules to be able to add new functionality in the future without making changes to them, extending but never modify directly\n- **L**iskov Substitution Principle\n  - only extend modules when it's still the same type at heart, if not, create its own type\n- **I**nterface Segregation Principle\n  - modules shouldn't need to know about functionality they don't use, split modules into smaller abstractions like interfaces, is useful when testing as it allows us to mock out only the functionality that each module needs\n- **D**ependency Inversion Principle\n  - code should communicate with each other abstractly through interfaces, allows for swapping parts of code\n\nCombining these principles ends up decoupling your code, which gives you modules that are independent of each other, making code maintainable, reusable, scalable and testable.\n\n## #3 Not using programming design patterns\n\n[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) give real solution to code problems, but they aren't fixed implementations.\n\nThey're used to architect software solutions, matching the right shapes to fit the needs our software has.\n\nTHere are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_type) main types\n\n1. Creational patterns - make and control new object instances i.e. factory pattern\n2. Structural patterns - how we organize and manipulate objects i.e. adapter pattern\n3. Behavioral Patterns - how code functions and how it communicates with other parts of the code, i.e. observer pattern.\n\nThese patterns are used in big corporations, and creates a universal vocabulary of programming.\n\n## #4 Bad naming\n\nBad variable naming makes code hard to interpret.\n\nHere are some fixes\n\n1. Avoid encoding - remove type information in variable\n2. Expand abbreviation - expand to full name to avoid miscommunication\n3. Use clear distinction - use names that more accurately represent nuances in code\n4. Replace \"magic\" values - define as named constants, clarifies significance and keeps things in sync if used elsewhere\n5. Be descriptive with names - find balance between clear enough without being verbose\n\n## #5 Not testing code\n\nWriting test can be difficult when code is not properly architected.\n\nAt the high level, there's end-to-end testing, which lets you test code as the end user.\n\nAny spaghetti code can be e2e tested since it doesn't really touch the code, but only what it delivers. It's also more tricky to setup since it requires a fully functional application running.\n\nAt the lower-level are unit tests that verify the operations of modules in isolation, and integration test that examines how modules interact with each other.\n\nApplying SOLID principles makes testing easier.\n\n## #6 Bad time management\n\nTime estimation is hard.\n\nRule of thumb is to 2x or 3x initial time estimate for a task.\n\nAccount for unknown problems along the way.\n\nRemember that creation goes hand-in-hand in problems.\n\nIt's better to overestimate schedule than underestimate it.\n\n## #7 Rushing\n\nThings can feel great when blazing through projects, there's a place for that in prototypes.\n\nBut if this is a long-term project, take your time and think things through from day-one.\n\nIt can give a better foundation to work from and avoid code debt.\n\nOvertime, you'll be saving time from batting decisions with no easy fix because of poor architecture.\n",

If you collected data, built pipelines, build a product, shipped something, write it all down in your resume.\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out? What do you look for when you hire?**\n\n> A lot of candidates look the same in coding tests. We look more at what they do outside of class, open source projects. There are some people who just have the love for building something, creating products that makes then stand out. These are the people that have deep knowledge about a certain thing, and having a conversation with them you can get signals that they've done a lot of shit.\n\n**What are some common mistakes candidates make?**\n\n> Nerves during interviews. Giving up on a problem at 0, and not trying to solve till 50% or 80%. Not asking edge cases when starting out in interview, which brings up a lot of issues later in your code. Advice is to just take a deep breath before each question. Calm down.\n\n**Were there key decisions or actions you took early in your career that contributed most to your success?**\n\n> It was small changes that eventually led me to where I am. I started out in consulting doing SWE, and I wanted to get into ML. I wanted to get into big tech to learn from great people. Just be sure rate of learning is positive. The industry is fast-paced and you have to be learning constantly.\n\n**Thoughts on Gen AI and how it impacts career?**\n\n> in every hype cycle of AI and ML people make a lot of predictions about what's going to happen, but things end up being the same. Things are definitely going to be different, it's going to be like the internet boom where a lot of business started making websites, APIs, etc. it'll happen with Gen AI as well. For ML, there's less focus on the data acquisition and training models, more on fine-tuning. For SWE, CRUD apps in webdev are going to go away, you can build basic websites with english now, although there are complexities with web dev now. So focus on the fundamentals and just pursue what you're interested in.\n\n**Culture difference in Amazon vs Meta?**\n\n> Amazon operates on a small margin, and it's very process-based. They're focused on how to optimize and improve their operations and processes. It also has a hierarchy where each team is siloed and you don't get access to what other teams are doing. They do have an annual ML conference where it's like academia, they have posters presenting their research. Meta operates on a high margin, they have more money to burn on new things. It's also very unstructured, you won't find documentation for something you need, so you'll be going across teams to get answers. Meta also values emotional intelligence. It's a big company, so experience is very team dependent.\n\n**What would you tell your younger self before starting a company?**\n\n> To start sooner. I wanted to start a company when I was your age, and wanted to get some experience from big tech. For some time I thought I didn't have enough experience yet or wasn't a good enough leader to start my own company. But now I believe 2-3 years is enough at a big tech and it can teach almost everything you need to know to found your own company. But working at big tech for so long did give me the financial ability to pursue my ventures now.\n\nSome mistakes:\n\n- felt intimidating talking to him right off the bat, I could tell he was really intelligent and articulate, everything he said was dense and rich in information.\n- I felt like I was asking really cliche and basic questions, and was thinking about better questions to ask midway, which made me lose focus about he was saying.\n- I was saying \"that's a good answer/point\", \"thank you for the insights\", but had nothing to respond back to or add on to what he said. I was also optimizing to ask as many questions as possible, but I need a less awkward way to respond back.\n- I was not confident in asking questions, I was hesitant and incoherent instead of being direct and clear.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n- Treat coffee chats as a conversation with a friend.\n- I should follow up on their response so I can latch on to something, give it time to digest and form structure.\n- I should do more research and ask questions that are high-value and specific to the person, my questions were too generic.\n\nI found this collection of interviews with ML practitioners on [ApplyingML](https://applyingml.com/mentors/) with some good questions and might be using some of these for my future coffee chats.\n",

    "content": "\nFinished my finals today and thought about dumping some thoughts on exams.\n\nIn Malaysia, there's this big test at the end of senior year of high school that everyone (in the national curriculum) takes before entering college. It's called [Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijil_Pelajaran_Malaysia) (SPM), or the Malaysian Certificate of Education.\n\nI took 10 subjects in the examination, and I remember the insane amount of effort that went into it. Our teachers for each course would provide past year papers with the answers, and our objective was to complete all of them.\n\nI had fun doing them, but it was a complete waste of time and energy. Instead of learning a useful skill, I was learning how to solve for x, without thinking **why** I had to solve for x in the first place.\n\nI did the exams, I got straight As, but what did I achieve? Was I just supposed to be this machine that was fed all that information and dump it all out?\n\nNow that I'm in university, I still feel that way about exams. But with more appreciation about both the good and bad of exams.\n\nWhat I like about exams:\n\n- studying with friends, going through something difficult together bonds us\n- a good way to make new friends, sharing practice questions, teaching them\n- teaches you how to consume and compress a lot of information in a short time\n- tests your understanding, but dependent on how much effort and care the lecture puts into making the questions\n- exam feels like a search problem, where the potential questions are a subset of the possible information covered in the course, also feels game theory like where you try to predict what kind of questions would the professor test us on.\n- as I take higher level classes, my exams has overlapping concepts, and I start to realize how the puzzle pieces connect together.\n\nWhat I don't like about exams:\n\n- doing well gives me false idea of knowing the content. I can get an A in the class but still not be able to **really** understand what's going on\n- puts me on a number line, directly comparing me with others, getting bad grades makes me feel like a failure.\n- anxiety-inducing and high pressure, my parents are paying a lot of money take courses as an international student, so I'm pressured to do well.\n- you're working in a vacuum and forced to work with what you have in your head, without any access to resources, which is unrealistic in the real-world.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n- I forget a lot from my previous classes because I don't apply information I've learned\n- I don't understand a class because I didn't seek to understand it in the first place, necessity is the impetus for learning, and I could never connect the information in my classes to something I can practically use at the time I was learning it.\n- I overthink a lot in exams, and when I overthink, I tend to change my mind about answers that were already correct, so I should pay attention to my first intuitions more.\n- the belief that you're not good at something is powerful, my inner thoughts when I face a problem I can't solve is \"I don't know this\", \"I'm screwed\", and it makes me give up really fast, clouds my judgement, and turns an easy problem into a complex one.\n",

    "content": "\n> In Bayesian statistics, model parameters are random variables.\n\nI took a [Bayesian statistics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayesian_statistics) course this semester and I think it'll be the most valuable course I'll ever be taking in my 4 year of undergraduate studies in Statistics at ISU.\n\nThere's a decay rate for knowledge that I retain for the classes I take, and it'll be the same for this course as well. But if there's one thing I want to take away from this course, it's the mindset of being a Bayesian\n\nI came across this [article](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/bayesian-inference-from-first-principles) by Christoph Molnar, and what better way to end the chapter of this course by understanding Bayesian modelling from first principles.\n\nThe first principles view of Bayesian statistics is that model parameters are [random variables](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Random_variable).\n\nThe model here can be a simple distribution, and the parameters - the mean of a distribution, coefficients in linear regression, the correlation coefficient - are variables with their own distributions.\n\nThis notion contrasts the frequentist view of treating parameters as fixed but unknown quantities. By treating them as random variables, we acknowledge the uncertainty around their true values.\n\nWe're also, later on, able to incorporate our beliefs since we assign [probability distributions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Probability_distribution) to these parameters.\n\nSo, we've established parameters are variables.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish in Bayesian modelling?\n\nWe start with data about an event, and we want to estimate a parameter of interest (θ). This parameter can be anything from effectiveness of a drug to the click-through rate on a website.\n\nIn mathematical form, our model is estimating P(θ|X), the parameter distribution for θ given the data X.\n\nBut we can't directly estimate P(θ|X), we don't know the true values of parameters in the real-word.\n\nIt's much more natural to estimate the inverse - P(X|θ) the distribution of data given parameters.\n\nAnd here's where [Bayes' theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayes'_theorem) come into the picture.\n\nThis theorem inverse the condition to P(X|θ), a.k.a the [likelihood function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Likelihood_function).\n\nFrom this theorem, we are given two things: P(θ), the prior distribution and P(X), the evidence.\n\nP(θ) is your beliefs about the world. You have to specify this BEFORE observing the data.\n\nThis prior can be informative or non-informative, and that determines how much your belief will influence the estimation. A non-informative prior means the data has more influence, and vice versa.\n\nIn statistics jargon, the posterior mean is the weighted average between the prior mean and the sample mean.\n\nThe cool thing being Bayesian is once you get an estimation P(θ|X), with the power of sequential updating, that becomes your new prior.\n\nThis idea of updating your priors is very intuitive, we're collecting new data and updating our beliefs from our interactions and experiences in everyday life.\n\nBayes' theorem also involves the term P(X) called the evidence, which is usually unfeasible to estimate. It's also known as the normalizing constant.\n\nSo instead we take the numerator P(X|θ) P(θ), which is proportional to the posterior distribution.\n\nIn most cases, the posterior distribution is not a known distribution like the Normal or Binomial distribution, so we need to perform sampling from the posterior using techniques such as [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo?useskin=vector).\n\nThere's no use to knowing all this without being able to apply it. So my goal is read [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) and learn [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) to put this knowledge into practice.\n",

With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\n\nIn the New Testaments, we have four [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\n\nAll of them tell the same story about the life of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus).\n\nThough the four books have many similarities, each author presents a unique perspective on Jesus, emphasizing a different theme for an intended audience.\n\n**Matthew** wrote mainly for Jews, emphasizing that Jesus, the son of David, was the Messiah for whom they were waiting. That’s why he began with a genealogy and includes multiple references to Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Jesus.\n\n**Mark** emphasizes Jesus as the Suffering Servant of God. This was especially relevant to believers in Jesus who were suffering for their faith.\n\n**Luke** was written to Theophilus, a gentile. Luke presents Jesus as the Son of Man and Savior of all people.\n\n**John** presents Christ as the Son of God and Creator of the world.\n\nThere's ongoing debate on the [historical reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels) on the Gospels.\n\nOne thing I found interesting is the only two events that are almost universally agreed upon are the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, and the crucifixion of Jesus by Pontius Pilate.\n",

I think I'll enjoy it a lot. The craft and detail that goes into taking each shot, and the adventure in choosing the right camera and roll of film.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4Yn16Rw8s) and got to learn a little but more about film photography.\n\nFirst, **how does film work**?\n\nThe basic idea is that film is a roll of plastic containing a magical mix of chemicals that make it sensitive to light.\n\nWhen film is placed into the camera, it lives in complete darkness.\n\nEvery time you shoot a photo, you let light in through the lense. That light then hits the film, and burns it in a way that shapes and color are reflected on the material.\n\nThe second question is **which camera** to choose.\n\nThere are 3 main types of film cameras:\n\n1. SLR (single-lens reflex camera)\n   - what you see on the viewfinder is very close to the image (thanks to mirror)\n   - option to change lenses and shoot manually\n   - bulkier and heavier\n   - who? action photography\n2. Rangefinder\n   - a different type of viewfinder that has framelines that assist you when shooting\n   - not all of them allow you to change the lens (the ones that do are more expensive)\n   - compact, smaller setup\n   - who? street photography\n3. Point & shoot\n   - automatic cameras, no need to set exposure or focus (depending on camera)\n   - require batteries\n   - who? easily capture moments of everyday life (first two requires precision and time)\n\nWhen choosing a **type of film**, there are two variables: style and price.\n\nAnd these films differ in color and contrast.\n\nFor beginners, go with Kodak GOLD 200 (cheapish color film)\n\nNow for **how to shoot**.\n\nWhen shooting film, exposure matters.\n\nOpposite from digital shooting, details in film are harder to recover from the shadows and easier from highlights. So, it's important to expose correctly or slightly overexposed, which means using a light meter.\n",

And your task is to name the color of the word, not the word itself, as fast as you can.\n\nFor example, when presented with the word \"[Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw)\", it's easier to say red, as opposed to the color of the text (blue).\n\nThere are some [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Theories) used to explain why this effect happens.\n\nThey're all based on the idea that our brains processes relevant and irrelevant information in parallel, but they both \"race\" to your brain's central processor to be chosen as a response.\n\nThis neurophysiological test has different [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Variations), and can reveal a lot about your brain and how it processes information.\n\nAmong the most important uses is in measuring a person's [selective attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27437-001) capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.\n\nIt can also diagnose different psychiatric and neurological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that studying this effect might help us better understand the black box that is our brain, which can allow us to overcome our fast instinctual thinking, known as System 1 in the book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow?useskin=vector), helping us reach to more logical conclusions.\n",

But that was a recipe for burnout.\n\nI would end up overwhelmed and disappointed, feeling I barely accomplished much at the end of the day.\n\nLately, I've been focusing on just doing three things for the day.\n\nHere's the system that I've been using, which draws from the [Bento method](https://www.bentomethod.com/bentomethod).\n\nMy tasks are split into 3 categories:\n\n- large (P1): Deep work that requires intense focus like writing articles, doing assignments, coding. (90+ mins)\n- medium (P2): Busy work that are process-based like research, editing, and organizing information. (45-60 mins)\n- short (P3): Habitual work like reading emails, catching up on news, doing the dishes, listening to podcasts. (15-30 mins)\n\nSo what are the three things?\n\nFor me, they comprise of one P1 task, and two P2 task. And however many P3 tasks that I perform on autopilot, like making my daily protein shake and listening to podcasts on the way to class, or doing laundry on the weekend.\n\nNow, there's also the question of when.\n\nIf you do time-blocking, how should you fit these tasks into your day?\n\nYour energy level throughout the day has 3 brackets too:\n\n- peak: mind and body are at their highest functioning form\n- through: exhausted from work during your peak period and need time and rest to replenish.\n- rebound: body is recovering from the low-energy trough and is ready to get back in focus mode for another few hours.\n\nAssign P1 tasks to the peak, and P2 tasks to the throughs. And for P3 tasks, save them for when your energy levels are at its lowest, since you can perform them on autopilot mode.\n",

Deconstruct the skill\n2. Learn enough to self-correct\n3. Remove practice barriers\n4. Practice at least 20 hours.\n\n**First**, decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done.\n\nIs it coding your own personal portfolio in React & Next.js? Building blazingly fast app using Rust? Creating a compiler from scratch? Be specific.\n\nSkills are just big bundles of other skills. Look into the skills you need to achieve it and deconstruct; break it down into smaller pieces.\n\nThe more you break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide what parts of the skills that will actually get you to what you want. Then practice those first.\n\nTo practice, you need reliable sources. Do some research, find 3-5 best resources. Don't use this as a way to procrastinate. Figure out the optimal stopping time for exploration, then start exploiting.\n\n**Second**, you don't have learn everything. You only need to learn enough to the point where you can practice, and self-correct as you practice.\n\nLearning is getting better at noticing when you're making a mistake, and doing something a little different every time.\n\nIn programming, that means having the ability to debug and fix errors in your code. It also means spotting opportunities to make your code more optimized.\n\n**Third**, life is full of distractions and the internet is full of noise. They get into the way of practicing.\n\nDevote time to learning. Block time out on your calendar. Set a timer and start working. Get into the flow with some music. Turn off notifications on your phone. Set website blockers.\n\n**Fourth**, we don't like to feel stupid. And when learning anything new, there's an initial frustration barrier.\n\nCommit to practicing. Learn in public. Get a study buddy. Write about what you learn. If you stick with the practice long enough, that barrier melts away.\n\nYou just have to practice 20 hours. That's 45 mins a day, for a month.\n\nAnd most importantly, **have fun**.\n",

Other runners would try to push harder, clenching their fists, scrunching their faces. But Carl Lewis stayed exactly the same—and go on to breeze past the others”\n\nWith this story, Hugh Jackman shares the idea of the the [85% rule](https://tim.blog/2020/06/26/hugh-jackman/).\n\nHe hypothesized that if you tell Type-A athletes to run at their 85% capacity, they will run faster than if you tell them to run at 100%, because it’s more about relaxation, and form, and optimising the muscles in the right way.\n\nAt first, it was counterintuitive to me that I don't have to give my 100% when trying to perform at my best.\n\nBecause if I'm not putting 100% effort into my work, then won't I fall behind to someone who is? Isn't pushing myself to the limit the precondition to success?\n\nBut the more I think about it, the more it made sense.\n\nWhen I practiced for my Grade 8 ABRSM Piano practical exam, I noticed diminishing returns as I practiced too much. My fingers would start tensing and start hitting the wrong keys. I forgot to relax. I was clenching my fists, pushing towards the finish line.\n\nWhen I studied for my final round interview with Glassdoor, overoptimized on the wrong things. I studied everything I could about AB tests, read dozens of articles, memorized the concepts. I passed the AB testing case study portion, but failed to explain what I had on my resume with any detail. I was racing down the finish line with perfect form, but it was the wrong race track.\n\nAs I'm graduating soon, every day feels like a race against time. I'm running at 110%, but it's still not fast enough.\n\nAs an international student, I tell myself I have to stand out from the rest, I need to put in more work while everyone else parties and has fun, and I can have fun later.\n\nBut all this \"productivity\" is backfiring. I'm burntout and exhausted. And with GERD on top of everything, I can't remember the last time I felt healthy.\n\nHopefully, writing this out will implant the 85% rule into my brain.\n\nWhere I will learn relaxation by scheduling breaks and being outside more, and stop maximizing performance and perfection by doing just enough.\n\n## Changelog\n\n- May 4, 2023: Found out the 85% rule is backed by a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4) in 2019 on Nature Communications\n",

Growing up in Malaysia and in an Asian household, you're pretty much expected to do good in school. I was also religious about ping pong, and devoted a big chunk of my primary and high school life to playing. I always had a friend who was better than me, and compared myself to him a lot.\n\nOnce I got out of high school and entered college, grades still mattered to me, but I was comparing myself with others on social qualities, i.e. how they dressed, how charismatic they were, and how many friends they had. I grew up wired to be quiet, and I sometimes wish being social and charismatic could just be a flip of a switch. I do believe once you do it more, it can become a switch, but right now I'm still at the point where forcing myself to socialize is taxing.\n\nNow, when I'm about to graduate, my focus and value system shifted more towards career and startups. I see 16 year olds on Twitter selling their startups and high school students getting internships at startups and I get incredibly envious, but moments later I get this intense drive and motivation.\n\nA [common advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtpOYxsZj7o) is to stop comparing yourself to others, especially someone you only see on the surface and to only compare yourself to the you from yesterday.\n\nBut I think you can extract some value by comparing yourself with others.\n\nIt can give you the necessary drive and fuel your motivation in times when you feel like you're in a rut.\n\nIt makes me go \"That could be me!\" and it makes be believe I can go bigger, do better.

Grant](https://youtu.be/1XDpa2HLXV0?t=596) shared in his TED Talk about two ways to overcome fear.\n\nFirst, practice gratitude. It's impossible to be fearful and grateful at the same time.\n\nI was amazed at how effective this is. I think this happens because fear stems from our uncertainty about the future, and gratitude helps guide us back to the present moment, allowing is to focus on the people around us, the things we have now, and how lucky we are to just be alive.\n\nThis made me recall of the idea that [a wandering mind is an unhappy one](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-wandering-mind-is-an-un/). I think letting your mind wander can cause fear.\n\nThe second way is to be intentional about your decisions.\n\nEverything that happens to you could be the best or the worst thing.

My go-to question tends to be, \"What's your major?\"\n\nBut I've come to realize posing that question is like running gradient descent with a small learning rate. It often takes a couple more questions (iterations) to really get to know that person or to get them talking (converge to global minimum).\n\nI think asking \"What are you interested in?\", gives an immediate glimpse into the person's life, revealing how they spend their time and their passions.\n\nI recently got asked what my life philosophy was, and I think that's a good question to ask. It did threw me off a bit, and made me think whether it's different from my values and principles. My answer was something along the lines of \"I want to create value, build something that provides value for humanity. I like coding and building stuff.\"\n\nAnother question is I want to start asking is \"What makes you happy?\" I think happiness is something a lot of people pursue, and you can tell a lot about a person from their answer.\n\nSome more lists of questions I found for better conversations\n\n- [Real Conversation Questions](http://jackieluo.com/questions)\n- [Questions to Ask People](https://www.calebontiveros.com/questions-to-ask-people/)\n- [Shortlist \"No Small Talk' questions (Kristen Berman)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnSo5Bg_QfLHrIiI60XJ00HxsHRvm33Yx3p3nYA6CDg/edit#gid=0)\n",

It feels like a nightmare that I'm still waiting to be woken out of.\n\nIf acceptance is the precursor to use suffering to get stronger, perhaps the precursor to acceptance is forgetting.\n\nI need to stop reliving the past, and move on.

    "content": "\nI learned a couple things about emotions from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqRYpEDDCrg) by Big Think.\n\nFirst, emotion is contagious, we can catch the emotional energy of another person. I was at NCUR 23' and this dude had insane energy talking about his research, I could feel his energy pulsating from him. I could feel his high lingering on me afterwards.\n\nSecond, emotion travels faster than rational thought. And when we experience big changes (layoffs, breakups, death), 5 signal emotions of change arise: fear, frustration, anger, anxiety, and grief.\n\nFirst law of thermodynamics tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Rather it can be transferred, transformed, or conserved. Let's apply this to emotional energy.\n\nConverting energy means bottling it all up inside, which then manifests in stress and burnout. Transferring energy is venting out to a friend. The problem with this is you're just moving energy around from one person to another.\n\nThe power comes in transforming energy, turning signal emotions into positive ones. You can take anxiety and turn it into anticipation, fear into motivation, grief into growth, all of which becomes fuel for growth and action.\n\nHow can you do this? You need self-awareness to know these negative emotions exist, then acknowledge it, and then choosing to transform them.\n\nThat means treating your mental state like a garden. A good gardener tends to their garden, and that means doing things like self-reflection, meditation, and journalling.\n\nThey know what's festering and what needs nurturing. That means remove negative thoughts from your mind like weeds from soil. And nurturing the positive emotions, so you can reap the crop, and be who you want to be.\n",

I drank soju with friends on New Year's Eve and had hotpot with family at Din Tai Fung, and a couple days after, I developed [GERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease?useskin=vector), and my life completely changed.\n\nI see GERD as a misfortune. One day I was fine, and the next I was struck by this incurable disease. It felt like a punishment that came out of nowhere, like being framed for a crime I did not commit. I always dream about going back to the past, when I was \"normal\". And this causes a lot of unhappiness.\n\nAI Marcus Aurelius said in this [podcast](https://dkbshow.substack.com/p/marcus-aurelius-podcast-interview) that to endure hardship and prevail is good fortune.\n\nIt's hard for me to accept that I have GERD.

But while you're going through that suffering, it's numbing to the brain and it's easy to succumb to what's easier, which is to continue wishing for things to be go back to the way it was, instead of accepting and acting.\n\nIt's going to take a lot of effort for sure, I mean no one said life was going to be easy.

Since data in the real-world changes over time, model performance will degrade as time passes, a phenomenon the authors called \"AI Aging\".\n\nMIT, Harvard, and other top institutions trained 4 different ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network) on 32 datasets from four industries (Healthcare, Weather, Airport Traffic, and Financial) and found that [91% of their ML models degrade over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15245-z)\n\nKey takeaway\n\n> Neither the data nor the model alone can be used to guarantee consistent predictive quality. Instead, the temporal model quality is determined by the stability of a specific model applied to the specific data at a particular time.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nThe right solution is context-dependent, and investigation should be done to understand the cause of the degradation\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1. Alert when model must be retrained: need access to latest ground truth or able to estimate model performance\n2. develop efficient and robust mechanism for automatic model retraining: (if no data quality issue or concept drift), retraining model on latest labeled data can help\n3. Have constant access to most recent ground truth: allows retraining, but in practice, ground truth is often delayed, expensive and time-consuming to newly labeled data. Alternative is to have a model catalog and use estimated performance to select best performing model\n\nMore:\n\n- https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html\n- https://www.nannyml.com/blog/6-ways-to-address-data-distribution-shift\n",
