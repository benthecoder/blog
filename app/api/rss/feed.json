Frankl, he describes the conditions of the prisoners minds in the camps and the context of this quote.\n\nIn each suffering lies two choices: to either **embrace suffering with dignity, bravery and moral perseverance**, or to decay, in his fight for self preservation, into an animal. This determines whether or not a man is worth of his suffering. The suffering of the greatest kind is the suffering where humans are depraved of all choices and yet, the last of human freedom is the choice of how we deal with our suffering.\n\nThere's also the stoics view, who believed a true sage was someone worthy of all challenges the gods sent their way.\n\n> Show me one who is sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Show him me. By the gods I would fain see a Stoic. Nay you cannot show me a finished Stoic; then show me one in the moulding, one who has set his feet on the path.” – Epicetus\n\nThere would be no Hercules without all the trials and tribulations he went through. He was worthy of the challenges he faced, and that's why we remember Hercules today.\n\nSo the question isn't whether you will or will not suffer.

I hate that I have to do it.\n\nI needed some form of comfort. A coping mechanism. I decided to bring Man's Search for Meaning along with me. Scrolling on my phone wouldn't cut it. I didn't want a distraction. I wanted powerful words. Words that can help me make sense of all these emotions.\n\nI read in the car while my sister drove my mom and I to Pantai Hospital, which translates to beach hospital in English. It's kinda funny. This is my vacation while I'm back. Hospitals.\n\nIt's my second time back after an initial consultation. I arrived at 9 a.m., but had to wait till 10:30 a.m. to be called into my patient bed to get changed and prepped for my procedure.\n\nWhile waiting, I read Dr. Frankl's words on suffering. By no means did I suffer even the slightest amount of pain and turmoil the prisoners went through in concentration camps. However, he wrote before that suffering has no size, great or small, it is still suffering.\n\nI was convinced to think of suffering differently, a new mindset, a new perspective. Suffering is an opportunity, a value that can be attainted if I look hard enough. A chance to meet my great fate, to reach spiritual heights that I would not otherwise. To not seek meaning in life, but to think about what life expects of me. To accept suffering as a life's task. And when I feel like giving up, to remind myself of the love of friends and family, and God, who expects me to keep hanging on. I had to remind myself of the \"why\", so that I can bear any \"how\". And that what doesn't kill me will only make me stronger. Because suffering is meaning and meaning is suffering, and life will never cease to have meaning. Reading these words help quiet down the storm in my heart. I kept seeing these issues in my life as a bad hand in the genetic lottery, as a statistics. I saw myself as unlucky, unworthy of my suffering. But reading all these words help me form a clear and precise picture my emotion, which is suffering, and it ceased to be suffering.\n\nI went in and sat on the hospital beds. I was asked to confirm my date of birth and last meal by many nurses on many accounts. I suppose you can't be too safe, you wouldn't want to operate on the wrong person.\n\nMy veins weren't showing well, so the intravenous cannula (IV) insertions had some hiccups. They first did it on my right hand, but it resulted in a blood clot, or in medical lingo, a superficial thrombophlebitis.\n\nThe three nurses came to look at my IV. Are these nurses even trained?\n\nI observed who my friends were in the open space. The patients were at least in their 40s. One was definitely in his 70s. I couldn't understand it. Why is this happening to me. I found it funny. I couldn't help but laugh. This is the life that I have to accept.\n\nAs I was laying in bed staring at the ceiling, I just kept thanking God and my family. And said prayers for the procedure to go well. And that I won't wakeup halfway to a doctor sticking a tube down my throat.\n\nAs I got rolled into the endoscopy room, those tv/movie scenes with people being rolled to the ER comes to mind. Luckily for me, I'm not going into ER.\n\nIn the room, I see nurses and doctors busy getting ready setting up the equipments and tools. Dr W, the gastroenterologist from my initial consultation was checking her phone.\n\nEverything happened really fast. It's like dancers getting ready for their performance.\n\nI was strapped on a blood pressure monitor on my arm, and a small one for my finger. The doctor in charge of my anesthetic stuck another IV down into my left arm, and it stung, a lot. I could feel my arm burning when he injected propofol. A nurse sprayed some numbing agent into my throat and asked me to swallow it. Before my brain could register the taste of it, I was asked to bite on a device that could keep my mouth open for the tube to enter. Then I was asked to roll my body to my left. Soon after, the lights went out.\n\nNext thing I knew, I was outside in the patient rooms. I slept like a baby. It was the best sleep I've had since I could remember, maybe since I had GERD. I wonder why that is.\n\nBoth my hands were hurting a lot. I was given a sandwich with white bread wrapping tomato tuna and a thin spread of egg. I told them I couldn't drink Milo, it is cocoa which has caffeine. Do they even know I have GERD?\n\nI ate my breakfast, and was feeling an unusual high. I was abnormally positive. It had to be a side effect of the drug, which I later found celebrities misuse. I was on Twitter a lot.\n\nAfter a while, it was time to get the results.\n\nI met up with my mom again, who's been waiting the entire time.\n\nI got to meet Dr W after waiting 30 more minutes. Her conclusion was that the hernia was still there, but the inflammation is less severe than a year ago. I wonder what I did differently. I might've been a lot less stressed out this past semester. I got to live a slower and peaceful life. And a lot of good things (some bad things too) happened.\n\nI can never understand why she gave me more medication. And I just took it without question.\n\nShe seemed to be hesitant about me getting surgery, but never explicitly voiced out the concern. I don't think she knows how much I want this surgery. It's taken 3 years of my life away. 3 years is a lot in my 20s. Time seems valuable at my age now. I feel like I have to be at my very best at this time, physically and mentally. Now I have a chance to take it back. I wasn't going to give in. This is why I came back for. Why I gave up my california dream. That doesn't mean I'm not afraid. I'm terrified. What if it's too early for surgery? What if I'm being too greedy? What if I'm pulling the lever too early? Instead of exploring more, I'm exploiting too early? Is this God's timing? There's a lot to think about. But I'm glad I'm not alone in this.\n","data":{"title":"Endoscope #3","tags":"journal","date":"Jan 19, 2024"},"filePath":"endoscope.md"},{"content":"\nEvery success takes a little bit of luck.

I don't like it when I don't understand something. So I spend a lot of time trying to understand things.\n\nBut how does one get better at understanding things? Is there a secret hack? Does the practice of trying to understand things well lead to the ability to think well? And what does it mean to understand something well?\n\nTo me, understanding something well means being able to reproduce the idea through speech (explaining to a 5 year old) or craft (coding from scratch) in a simpler, concise manner, like compression, ideally lossless so that you're not straying too far away from the original idea.\n\nKasra has more comprehensive and actionable ideas on [how to think well and understand things](https://bitsofwonder.substack.com/p/how-to-think-well-and-understand), and here's my takeaway on it.\n\n## pay attention\n\npay attention to when you do or don't understand something\n\n- your goal is to get from point A (material is inscrutable) to point B (material is totally intelligible)\n- break things down into manageable pieces and understand those first\n  - make a list of all the words you don't understand and look them up\n  - keep asking yourself: **What are the things I do and don’t understand? At what point in the chain of reasoning did I get lost? What do I need to figure out next to make progress?**\n- What does it mean to understand something?\n  - something to do with your mind entering an isomorphic state to the mind of someone else who does understand it.\n- how do you know you achieved this?\n  - Seek feedback in as many forms as possible.\n  - Play around with the idea, re-explain it to yourself, ask yourself why the concept or theory is in this particular shape rather than another shape.\n  - What are the implications of the theory? What does it leave unresolved?\n  - Share all of these thoughts with others and see whether it makes sense to them.\n\n## Understand the history\n\n- divide the space of things you're trying to learn into **what** and the **why**\n  - what: content of our models and theories\n  - why: why this conclusion? answer lies in a history of experiments, proposals, and disagreements\n- **Reproduce the trail**: write out your own proof for the theorem, implement your own version of the algorithm, design your own hypothetical experiment.\n- **Building intuition**: When you know the trail of experiments and arguments that led us here, you start to build an intuition for how to solve future problems.\n\n## flexibility > correctness\n\n- for big questions with no answers, have the mental flexibility to “take on” different perspectives and see the merits and flaws of each.\n- constantly expose ourselves to different schools of thought and attempt to understand them even when we think they’re probably wrong.\n\n## don't cling on to a singular Truth\n\n> If understanding is contorting your mind to be isomorphic to someone else’s, the holy grail is to be able to contort quickly between various frames of thinking, to see how something that seems absurd on its face might actually be the next world-changing insight.\n","data":{"title":"How to Understand things","tags":"thinking, reading","date":"Jan 16, 2024"},"filePath":"understand.md"},{"content":"\n![The Bookworm (Spitzweg), Carl Spitzweg](/images/reading.jpg)\n\nsome highlights from Simon Sarris's [reading well](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/reading-well).\n\n### The act of reading\n\n- Reading is alluring. It has a nameless quality beyond satisfying desires for information and pleasure\n- Reading is nearly solitary. At the beginning you are alone with just the characters. By the end, you are alone with just the author\n- Reading is letting someone else model the world for you.\n- And after finishing a very good book one is driven a little mad, forced to return from a world that no one nearby has witnessed.\n\n### Read for the stories\n\n- The goal is not to digest information, but to **layer over your reality with a fresh coat of moss**. Your own world becomes colored by these stories, so it is worthwhile to spend time seeking the excellent works from across cultures and history.\n- A person who reads no great stories will be influenced by the few stories he does come across in life, for better or worse — and I think mostly worse.\n- a life that is sown with stories is one better positioned to **think and dream**.\n- He who has no poetry in himself will find poetry in nothing. A person that reads no stories is unready for life. A person that reads many stories will be open to yet more stories.\n\n### Read more fiction\n\n- But I think what is most valuable to read are the category of works that resist summary, and the commonplace nonfiction books rarely fulfill that.\n- on fondness for non-fiction: I think this arises from a belief that superior knowledge of the world comes from non-fiction. This thought is attractive to people who build systems, but **over-systematizing and seeing systems in everything can be a failure mode**.\n- Careful descriptions and summaries miss too much of the world. Hard distinctions make bad philosophy\n- Reading fiction helps you become an **unsystematic thinker**, something that is equally valuable but more elided by some engineers. It is easy to maintain an intellectual rigidity. It takes more care to maintain **a loose poeticism of thought**.\n","data":{"title":"How To Read Well","tags":"reading","date":"Jan 15, 2024"},"filePath":"reading.md"},{"content":"\nSome useful tactics to [getting things done](https://dubroy.com/blog/getting-things-done-in-small-increments/) in small increments by Patrick Dubroy.\n\n- **Make small progress everyday**: most things worth doing take longer, make a little progress even if it's 20 minutes a day\n- **Always know what the next thing to do is**: have a clear end goal (e.g. fix this bug) or concrete next step (e.g. write function to do X), add TODO statements in code.\n- Pay attention to **feedback loops**: fast feedback is important when working in small increments, this might mean hot reload for React, TDD, etc.\n- For bigger things, **make a plan and keep a log**: take 10-15 minutes to write down a plan before starting, when you get interrupted, take 30 seconds to summarize your progress and any next steps\n- **Block distractions**: HN, Twitter, block these websites on your computer, make context switching hard, use arc spaces to help you focus on one thing.\n","data":{"title":"Getting things done","tags":"work","date":"Jan 14, 2024"},"filePath":"thingsdone.md"},{"content":"\n![Melancholy, Edgar Degas](/images/melancholy.jpeg)\n\n[Defense mechanisms](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/defense-mechanisms) are unconscious psychological responses that protect individuals from anxiety, threats to self-esteem, and things they don't want to think about or deal with.\n\nIt was first described by Freud in his psychoanalytic theory.\n\nWhile defense mechanisms are often thought of as negative reactions, they can be adaptive and allow us to function normally, like using humor to get through a stressful situation.\n\nThey become harmful when they prevent us from confronting and dealing with issues, leading to an unresolved problem and contributing to unhealthy patterns of behaviour.\n\nIt's important to develop self-awareness and recognize when we are using them. Therapy helps to understand your defense mechanisms and learn healthier coping strategies. Always confront and process emotions and situations we are defending against, rather than avoiding them.\n\nBelow is a list of common defense mechanisms.\n\n1. **Denial**: \"I've been smoking for years and I'm perfectly fine.\"\n2. **Repression**: A person who had a traumatic experience in their childhood can't remember anything about the event.\n3. **Projection**: A person who is often dishonest suspects others are always lying to them.\n4. **Displacement**: \"He couldn't yell at his boss, so he came home and kicked the dog.\"\n5. **Regression**: A grown adult throwing a tantrum if they don't get their way like a child\n6. **Rationalization**: A student who gets a poor grade claims the teacher doesn't like them, rather than acknowledging they didn't study enough\n7. **Sublimation**: A person with aggressive tendencies becomes a professional boxer to express their aggression in a socially acceptable manner.\n8. **Reaction formation**: A person who is secretly attracted to a coworker constantly talks about how much they dislike them.\n9. **Intellectualization**: After a breakup, a person spends time researching psychological process of grief rather than allowing themselves to feel the pain and sadness\n10. **Avoidance**: A person who is afraid of heights takes a longer route to avoid crossing a high bridge\n11. **Acting Out**: When a person can't express their feelings verbally, they might act out their emotions.\n12. **Compartmentalization**: separating different aspects of life so that failure in one area doesn't affect self-esteem in another, \"I may have failed as a spouse, but at least I'm a good parent\"\n13. **Undoing**: 'undo' an unhealthy thought or behavior by engaging in a contrasting behavior, being overly nice to someone to compensate for thinking something mean\n14. **Suppression**: consciously pushing distressing thoughts to the back of the mind\n15. **Identification**: unconsciously adopting the characteristics of a more powerful person in order to feel less vulnerable, the bullied becoming the bully\n","data":{"title":"Defense Mechanisms","tags":"psychology","date":"Jan 13, 2024"},"filePath":"defensemechanism.md"},{"content":"\nI've always been told that stress is bad and I should avoid it. That I'm overworking myself and it's my body telling me to stop. I agree that chronic stress is an issue, but I always believed that the right amounts of stress can be good.\n\nRecently I discovered that the mindset towards stress is important as well from the [Huberman lab podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset), specifically the episode on applying growth mindset.\n\nHe cites a study: [Rethinking stress: The role of mindsets in determining the stress response](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-06053-001), where they basically had two groups of participants watch two distinct clips biased towards the nature of stress in 2 ways (stress is good vs stress is bad)\n\nThe tl;dr of the study:\n\n> Stress is bad -> Stress is debilitating.  \n> Stress is good -> <mark>Stress is enhancing</mark> .\n\nThe did multiple experiments, and one of them was testing on work performance, on soft tasks and hard tasks.\n\nThe takeaway is the people who learned that **stress is enhancing** significantly **improved their performance** on hard tasks, and the group who learned that stress is bad had no improvements at all.\n\nKeep in mind there were no additional practice, no drills to do, all that happened was they heard a tutorial that stress is enhancing.\n\nMindset matters.\n\nMore specifically, our cognitive appraisal (a fancy word for understanding) about stress matters: increased cortisol levels, elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus, and shifting of blood away from the periphery, etc.\n\nAll of these are characteristics features of a stress response, we've learned that these are mechanisms put into us to get away from lions.\n\nThe reality is that the stress response is there for a lot of reasons. It is inherent to us and other species as a way to **mobilize us** either away from things or towards them. We need the stress response to engage in **adaptive challenges**.\n\nSo the takeaway is to internalize that the **stress response is neither good or bad**, it depends on whether or not you believe the sensations you're experiencing are serving to enhance your performance or diminish your performance.\n\nAnd **Just learning that it can enhance your performance, can enhance performance.**\n","data":{"title":"Stress is Enhancing","tags":"stress","date":"Jan 12, 2024"},"filePath":"stressenhance.md"},{"content":"\nToday, I visited the third specialist for my condition.\n\nThe prior two specialists validated my condition. I did two endoscopes. The first one didn't catch anything, it only confirmed I had GERD. The second showed something more, it gave me more information to work with. It said I have a hiatal hernia Hill III.\n\nI was generating questions in the car with ChatGPT on my iPhone. So that I'm utilizing every second I have with him for the consultation, which later on I discovered costs RM 250 for just 15 min of his time.\n\nBeing in a hospital again feels familiar now, when I was growing up I remember joking and being glad that I never had any serious health issues that required me to admit to hospitals. Oh how I wish that could still be true.\n\nAfter taking the measurements for my health records, I was asked to wait for the doctor outside. A nurse then said that he was to perform a scope, so I had to wait 45 minutes more.\n\nI went out to the courtyard to catch a breath. I forget Malaysia's weather was humid, I miss the weather in the US.\n\nI joked to my mom, people come back from overseas to travel, eat good food, and see old friends. My first visit was to a hospital, to see a new doctor, but the bright side is I did get to eat good food after that.\n\nI was pacing myself around the courtyard, my thoughts mind kept oscillating between fear and gratitude, and I find myself internalizing the words \"it's going to be okay Ben, be grateful that you even get the chance to fix this, that your dad can pay for this, imagine if you were poor and you had this disease, that's even more unfortunate, stop comparing unhealthy you and healthy others.\" I also took some photos because it was a nice courtyard, with a koi fish pond.\n\nIt was time to see the doctor.\n\nI sat down in his room, with my mom and sister with me. He asks \"so what's wrong?\". I ask if can I use English, and begin my story.\n\nHis immediate reaction was, \"Oh so you were the one who messaged me? Wow, so young...\", his eyebrows slightly furrowed and his eyes softened with sympathy.\n\nHe starts the lecture on what GERD is and why reflux happens which I've heard a billion times, I don't understand why they would assume I don't already know this given I've suffered with this for 3 years. But I suppose it's standard practice to explain things.\n\nHe asked me what were the events that led to the first symptoms. I mention home workouts. I ask if this is genetic, I want someone, something to blame for this condition. I want a reason behind all this. He says, some people are naturally thin, and if you work out (especially with bad form), you risk stressing your muscles too much. I ask again if this is genetical, I forget his answer. There's no point knowing. I only want to know if I can be cured.\n\nHe talks about the surgery. My mom asks for the cost. He says ballpark range of RM 35k. My mom mentions I have no insurance. The doctor, surprised, asks why, she replied overseas studies. My dad thought he could save money.\n\nThere are different forms for the surgery, 180 or 360 degree wrap, and it can go different directions. He mentions a 360 might mean you won't be able to belch or vomit easily, or at all, where as a 180 has less side effects, but possible less effective at treating it. He mentions this has a good 10 year cure to it, after that, he's not sure.\n\nThere's too many variables here, I can't deal with uncertainties like this. I need data. I should dive into the research for this operation.\n\nBut he mentions surgery means I get to eat like how I used to, and as much as I want. I won't be thin anymore. That gave me some hope. A glimmer into what my life can be if everything goes well.\n\nI ask if I can work out again. If I can build my muscles like all my friends did back in ISU. I envied their ability to just stress their body out, and instead of getting GERD, they get healthy, strong, ripped bodies that they get to flaunt around, and enjoy social and practical benefits of it.\n\nI ask blatantly if there are other doctors I can get a second opinion on.\n\nThis is scary. What if surgery doesn't fully cure me? What if I go back to the US, and it comes back? What if I never get my life back?\n\nAfter consultation my sister brought us to Arkadia for Hakka food. I forgot how KL has a lot of good chinese food. I no longer have to think about food and that's such a blessing. It's all paid for by my dad. I need to start thanking him more.\n\nThen I went IKEA to buy a bunch of things I need to create a space for myself, a space for writing, for building, and for growing. And also a house for my cat (fingers crossed)\n\nI spent 1500 here, and I felt so guilty, since I might have to take RM 40k out of my dads pocket with this surgery, not to mention with conditions of my teeth and skin. I'm using so much money. I don't think I'm having kids, I do not want to place this burden on my future kids, I don't have good genes.\n\nThe day ended with the night market. It was nice being back, I recalled some moments I had here when I was younger, when life used to be simpler, when my body was fine, when all I cared about at that time was to just have fun.\n\nI more optimistic than ever for the past 3 years, in light of the events today. It seems surgery is very much possible, and can cure me.\n\nI also realized money is so important. I need to find the right intersection of what I do that I find fun and enjoy, and what has financial returns that can bring financial freedom.

If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n> 1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n> 1. Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or jargon if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n> 1. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\n\n### Stephen King\n\n> 1. Get to the point.\n> 1. Write a draft. Then let it rest.\n> 1. Cut down your text.\n> 1. Be relatable and honest.\n> 1. Don’t care too much what others may think.\n> 1. Read a lot.\n> 1. Write a lot.\n\n### The Age of the Essay\n\nPaul Graham\n\n> An essay begins with a question. You notice a door that’s ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what’s inside.\n>\n> Surprise the reader by telling them something they always knew deep inside but didn’t bother to do the work to make it conscious.\n>\n> Collect surprises. It’s a trainable skill. The more anomalies you’ve seen, the more easily you’ll notice new ones.\n>\n> Pay attention to things you’re not supposed to. If you’re curious about something, trust your instincts. Don’t believe what you’re supposed to.\n>\n> Expressing ideas helps to form them. In a real essay you’re thinking out loud.\n>\n> Writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.\n>\n> Don’t plan. From paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their course. Real thought is full of false starts. An essay is a cleaned-up train of thought.\n>\n> Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.\n>\n> Aim for maximum surprise – things you didn’t know that contradict things you thought you knew. What surprises you?\n>\n> Ask ‘why’ about things that feel off. That’s where fruitful material is.\n>\n> Read it out loud and fix everything that doesn’t sound like conversation.\n>\n> Ask reviewers for two things: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing.\n>\n> Cut the boring bits.\n>\n> Make unconvincing bits more clear, or change what you’re saying if you’re wrong.\n\n### Bertrand Russell's Writing Rules\n\n> 1. A style is not good unless it is an intimate and almost involuntary expression of the personality of the writer, and then only if the writer’s personality is worth expressing.\n> 1. There are some simple maxims-not perhaps quite so simple as those which my brother-in-law Logan Pearsall Smith offered me-which I think might be commanded to writers of expository prose. **First**: never use a long word if a short word will do. **Second**: if you want to make a statement with a great many qualifications, put some of the qualifications in separate sentences. **Third**: do not let the beginning of your sentence lead the reader to an expectation which is contradicted by the end.\n> 1.

I appreciated the format of this book, it's a list of 9 HOW TOs applicable to life, and I while I was reading, I was the reader of my own self.\n\n### Love Life\n\n- \"what would you do in your last hour?\"\n- \"our dissatisfaction were more the result of a certain way of living than of anything irrevocably morose about human experience\"\n- if mortality encourages you to reevaluate your priorities, ask yourself what your priorities are\n- if you've been living a half-life before this, what does a whole life consist of?\n- we shouldn't need a cataclysm to love life today, it would be enough to think that we are humans, and that death may come this evening\n\n### Read for Yourself\n\n- \"one cannot read a novel without ascribing to the heroine the traits of the one we love\"\n- \"every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self\"\n- \"art can properly affect rather than distract us from life\"\n- The value of a novel is not limited to its depiction of emotions and people akin to those in our own life; it stretches to an ability to describe these far better than we would have been able, to put a finger on perceptions that we recognize as our own, but could not have formulated on our own\"\n\n### Take Your Time\n\n- \"greatness of works of art has nothing to do with the apparent quality of their subject matter, and everything to do with the subsequent treatment of that matter\"\n- \"everything is potentially a fertile subject for art and we can make discoveries as valuable in an advertisement for soap as in Pascal's Pensées\"\n- \"n'allez pas trop vite - an advantage of not going by too fast is that the world has a chance of becoming more interesting in the process\"\n- \"Hang on to the performance, read the newspaper as though it were only the tip of a tragic or comic novel, use thirty pages to describe a fall into sleep when need be\"\n\n### Suffer Successfully\n\n- \"Love is an incurable disease.\" In love, there is permanent suffering\". Those who love and those who are happy are not the same\"\n- pain is subjective: \"we cannot allow ourselves to judge the legitimacy of another's pain simply on the basis of the pain we would have suffered had we been similarly afflicted\"\n- \"feeling things (usually means feeling them painfully) is at some level linked to the acquisition of knowledge\"\n  - \"being jilted by a lover is a perfect introduction to the mechanisms of emotional dependency\"\n- \"we don't really learn anything probably until there is a problem, until we are in pain, until something fails to go as we had hoped\"\n- \"we become properly inquisitive only wh ne distressed. We suffer, therefore we think, and we do so because thinking helps us to place pain in context. It helps us to understand its origins, plot its dimensions, and reconcile ourselves to its presence.\"\n- \"we cannot be taught wisdom, we have to discover it for ourselves by a journey which no one can undertake for us, an effort which no one can spare us\"\n- \"... a relationship between the degree of pain a person experiences and the profundity of thought he or she may have as a result\"\n- \"It is grief which develops the strengths of the mind. These griefs put us through a form of mental gymnastics\"\n- \"if genuine priority is the development of our mental capacities, the implication is we would be better off being unhappy than contentment, better off pursuing tormented love affairs than reading Plato or Spinoza\"\n- it is not the contented who have left many profound testimonies of what it means to be alive, but the violently miserable, suffering is the perfect precondition for insight.\n- \"suffering opens up possibilities for intelligent, imaginative inquiry – possibilities that may quite easily be, and most often are, overlooked or refused\"\n- \"far greater wisdom would seem to lie in pursuing ways to properly and productively unhappy\"\n- the task is to gain a better understanding of reality. Pain is surprising: we cannot understand why (we're suffering). Identifying reasons for such discomforts does not absolve us of pain, but may form the principal basis of a recovery. While assuring that we are not uniquely cursed, understanding grants us a sense of boundaries to, and bitter logic behind, our suffering.\n- \"too frequently, suffering fails to alchemize into ideas, instead of a better sense of reality, it pushes us into a baneful direction where we learn nothing new, where are subject to many more illusions and entertain far few vital thoughts than if we had never suffered to begin with\"\n- these are bad sufferers: people who learn nothing from their sufferings, and instead, react to them with a variety of ruinous defense mechanisms which entail arrogance and delusion, cruelty and callousness, spite and rage.\n\n### Express your Emotions\n\n- \"there may be significant things to learn about people by looking at what annoys them the most\"\n- \"find the right words for things\", don't just say \"That's nice.\", it prevents ourselves or our interlocutors from really understanding what we have lived through. \"We stay on the outside of our impression\"\n- \"The problem with cliché is not that they contain false ideas, but rather they are just superficial articulations of very good ones\"\n- \"the way we speak is ultimately linked to the way we feel, because how we describe the world must at some level reflect how we first experience it\"\n- \"wanting to sound like other people has it's temptation. there are inherited habits of speech guaranteed to make us sound authoritative, intelligent, worldly, appropriately grateful, or deeply moved\"\n- \"they begin to write well only on condition they're original, that they create their own language\"\n- \"Only that which bears the imprint of our choice, our taste, our uncertainty, our desire and our weakness can be beautiful\"\n- \"giving to what we feel a form of expression which differs so much from, and which nevertheless after a little time take to be, reality itself\"\n- \"our notion of reality is at variance with actual reality, because it is often shaped by inadequate or misleading accounts\"\n- \"[Monet] has freed himself from traditional, and in some ways limited, representations of La Havre, in order to attend more closely to his own, uncorrupted impressions of the scene\n- \"in every successful work of art: an ability to restore to our sight a distorted or neglected aspect of reality\"\n\n### Be a Good Friend\n\n- \"Marcel was passionately interested in his friends. Never have I seen less egoism, or egotism ... He wanted to amuse you. He was happy to see others laughing and he laughed\" – Georges De Lauris\n- \"Never, right up to the end, neither his frenzied work, nor his suffering made him forget his friends – because he certainly never put all his poetry into his books, he put as much into hsi life\" - Walter Berry\n- the likelihood of honesty in friendship is highly dependent on how much is on our minds (true but hurtful) thoughts and their tolerance to the truth (how ready others will be to break off the friendship given the honesty)\n- \"I feel infinite sadness at seeing how few people are genuinely kind\"\n- \"My only consolation when I am really sad is to love and ot be loved\"\n- \"He should always be the one to ask questions and address himself to what was on your mind rather than risk boring you with what was on his\"\n- \"conversations required an abdication of oneself in the name of pleasing others in the name of pleasing companions.\n- \"it was not for elucidating, egoistically, things that one was interested in (friendship). It was primarily for warmth and affection\"\n- \"i do my intellectual work within myself, and once with other people, it's more or less irrelevant to me that they're intelligent, as long as they're kind, sincere etc\"\n- \"I like you and I would like you to like me\"\n- every friendship demands a degree of insincerity: \"the ever-present requirement to deliver an affable but hollow word to a friend who proudly shows us a volume of her poetry or her newborn baby\"\n- discern the incompatibilities of truth and affection, divide their projects, make a wise separation\n\n### Open your Eyes\n\n- \"our sense of beauty was not immobile, and could be sensitized by painters, who would, through their canvases, inculcate in us an appreciation of once neglected aesthetic qualities\"\n- \"great painters possess such power to open our eyes because of the unusual receptivity of their own eyes to aspects of visual experience: the play of light on the end of a spoon, ..., pinkish tones on an old man's skin – qualities that can inspire our impressions of beauty\"\n- happiness may emerge from taking a second look; our dissatisfactions may be the result of failing to look properly at our lives rather than the result of anything inherently deficient about them.\n- \"it isn't his life that has been mediocre as much as the image of it he possessed in memory\" (images which preserve nothing of life)\n- \"beauty is something to be found, rather than passively encountered, it requires us to pick up on certain details.\"\n- simple images provide certainties, ex: spending money makes you happier, aristocrats who are more educated and well-spoken have more class, that formal education, factual knowledge and university degree = intelligence\n\n### Be Happy in Love\n\n- the limits lie not in love, but in the \"general difficulty of maintaining an appreciative relationship with anything or anyone that was always around\n- the idea of love feels like a vague, chimerical dream, and after having it, it can grow chimerical and vague\n- \"he will soon forget what is there to be grateful, because the memory of Gilberte-less life will fade, and with it, evidence of what there is to savor.\"\n- \"we're creatures of habit, and therefore always liable to grow contemptuous of what is familiar\"\n- \"Presence may be the very element that encourages us to ignore or neglect it, because we feel we may have done all the work simply in securing visual contact\"\n- \"deprivation quickly drives us into a process of appreciation\"\n- \"learn a lesson of what we naturally do when we lack something, and apply it to conditions where we don't\"\n- \"if long acquaintance with a lover breeds boredom, ..., it may be we do not know him or her well enough\"\n- \"suffer the interval between desire and gratification, ..., it allows people to know and fall deeply in love with paintings in Dresden, hats, dressing gowns, and someone who isn't free this evening\"\n- secrets to long-lasting relationships: \"Infidelity, not the act itself, but the threat of it. An injection of jealousy is the only thing capable of rescuing a relationship ruined by habit\"\n\n### Put Books Down\n\n- there is a danger of taking books too seriously, a healthy relationship (with books) would depend as much on an appreciation of their limitations as of their benefits\n- \"The universe suddenly regained infinite value in my eyes\" on works of John Ruskin. \"he found experiences that he had never been more than semiconscious of raised and beautifully assembled in language\"\n- \"books can bring back to life, from the deadness caused by habit and inattention, valuable yet neglected aspects of experience\"\n- \"there is no better wya of coming to be aware of what one feels oneself than trying to recreate in oneself what a master has felt\" \"we should read other people's books in order to learn what we feel; it is our own thoughts we should be developing\"\n- all books can do is provide us with desires, \"That is the value of reading, and also its inadequacy. To make it into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it\"\n- dangers of books \"instead of awakening us to the personal life of the mind, reading tend to take its place, when the truth no longer appeals to us as an idea which we can realise only bt the intimate progress of our own thought and the efforts of our heart, but as something material, deposited between the leaves of books like honey fully prepared by others and which we only need to take the trouble to reach down from the shelves of libraries and then sample passively in a perfect repose of mind and body\"\n- good books can silence people\n  - \"his combination of the utmost sensibility with the utmost tenacity. He searches out these butterfly shades to the last grain. He is as tough as catgut and as evanescent as a butterfly's bloom. And he will I suppose both influence me and make me out of temper with every sentence of my own\"\n  - \"So sick of Orlando I can write nothing\" - Virginia Woolf\n- \"artistic idolaters combined literal reverence for objects depicted in art with a neglect for the spirit of art\" - \"a picture's beauty does not depend on the things portrayed in it\"\n- \"look at our world through his eyes, not to look at his world through our eyes\"\n\nThis took 1 hr 42 minutes.

I might've been awake for the past 24 hours, time is a blur.\n\nI seem to capable of reading books only on plane rides, it feels more justified. Why would I spend time reading fiction and non-fiction when I could be coding, learning, and building? It seemed like opportunity cost that was too high. I already read articles on a daily basis. However, one of the habits I plan to build is to read physical books for ~30 minutes before bed. This way I can actually finish all the books I bought. And it might be good for my eyes and my sleep.\n\nI really enjoyed this book, it's more practical than reading Crime and Punishment or Great Expectations, where you're sucked into the story, forced to go through the torments, the heartbreaks, the sufferings of the characters. And at the end of reading it, you go \"Wow, what a story! how did the author dream up this entire book?\". Unless you put in the work to study the characters, the psychology behind them, the hidden context, the implicit meaning lying in between the words, you don't really get much from reading books like this. Sure you remember faint snapshots about Raskolnikov's mental anguish and psychological torment after committing a gruesome murder, and Pip's impoverished background and his rise in social status, but it's hardly applicable to your own life.\n\nIn this book, I got to learn about the interesting, eccentric, bedridden, generous, relatable, character who is Proust, a French novelist who wrote a really long book called _In Search of Lost Time_. From his book, Alain extracts key life lessons from his personal background and the fictional (but also very real)characters from his book.\n\nFrom lessons about how to love life today and suffer successfully, to express your emotions, being a good friend, and being happy in love, they're filled with personal accounts of his life experiences.\n\nI found his ideas on how to **suffer successfully** extremely rewarding, especially at very moment in my life. The painful moments where I couldn't eat 99% of the food served on the plane because of my tremendously inconvenient food restrictions, when I have pains from stretching and moving my chest due to the inflammations, even from breathing too deeply, when I have heartburn and consistent, dull, pain below my ribs probably because of the high altitude or the messed up eating schedule, when I can feel my throat burning, my breathing forcibly and uncomfortably strained the entirety of my long, painful existence, I think about how to suffer successfully in light of all this, how not to be a \"bad sufferer\" as he calls it, and succumb to pessimism, to be stuck in a violently miserable state, to turn off all emotions and sensibility and isolate myself from the world, and ultimately flirting with the lingering thoughts about ending it all.\n\nAfter distracting myself with two Sherlock Holmes movie series portrayed by R.D.J., and a third of a quarter of Harry Potter The Deathly Hallows, when my plane landed in Malaysia, I felt immense sadness and yearning. The state of my health shoved me into a corner where I had to give up what I fought for for the past 2 years, the internship hunts and the interviews, the constant pressure to always be learning and growing or I'll never be good enough to land a job, the inability to relax and rest because I was an international student, and by default, I had to work 10x harder. Failure to me meant going back home after graduation, it meant I wasn't good enough, that I failed to live up to my potential, that I have to continue to depend on my father who's already 61 years of age to pursue graduate school. Failure is more complicated and harder to define when it's something out of my control. An external bad actor that has a mind of it's own and specializes in making my life miserable. I can't will myself out of gerd, out of my sensitive skin, my inflammations, and other defects of my body that I attribute to my horrible genes. Perhaps failure is setting the wrong expectations, expectations that do not match reality. I came to the US, already sick, so I probably should've prepared myself for the possible outcome of returning home after graduation.\n\nI keep picturing healthy me living the life I always wanted, yet a realistic picture would be unhealthy me attempting to continue to survive with a deteriorating body. Truth is I was really depressed the entire time I was in the US, even when I was in California, especially when I was travelling around to all these new places, going to good restaurants, and trying new things, my limitations became more stronger and evident, I realized more things that I couldn't do as my opportunities and possibilities expanded. I found it hard to live with myself, to be trapped in a body that I did not want to live in, to be forced a hand in the game of life, where I no longer could exercise, an extremely important part of my life which helped me de-stress and build strength and endurance, something people who are perfectly fine do not perform because they're lazy. I couldn't move freely anymore. I had no freedom.\n\nThat said, I miss a lot of things about the US, and everything I see and hear in Malaysia just makes me miss them more. I'm leaving what to me, is a better life in all aspects. A higher paying job, my friends, good weather, old bookstores, California and Boston and Seattle, the tech industry, the hackathons, the cold, the accents, the culture, the atmosphere, my comfy room with 0 mess. I miss all this. a lot. Perhaps I should heed the advice of Proust, to see the beauty in everyday objects and things, take my time on what seems boring at first, to not let snobbery get in the way of appreciation of my culture, my home, and my people.\n\nChange is hard, especially one of this degree. We seek comfort in what is familiar and we avoid discomfort and change and potential for growth. We are creatures of habit, and bad habits (often times unconscious) are sinister. We take for granted much of the blessings in our lives, the people especially. We fail to live a good life because we're afraid. We fear the unknown, the terrifying thought of not knowing what to do with your life, the paralyzing notion that everything we do has no meaning and your life adds up to nothing but a speck in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI don't know what the purpose was for writing all this, I'm currently very jet-lagged and tired, but I have too many thoughts on my mind, usually they go in loops, never-ending cycles of grief. So writing this helps quiet it down, it gives a channel for it to flow, instead of an sporadic mini explosions, it's controlled, I'm calling the shots, I let it explode all at once.\n\nI'm also writing to remind myself of the good. It's something I often overlook and forget. I fail to see what I already have, and I only see what I don't. The dangers of having something is it forget what it was like to not have something. And the easier it was to obtain it, where the delay between desire and gratification is short, the lesser the appreciation.\n\nSo to remind myself: I have a loving family and a home to come back to and a father who can expense my medical bills to help figure out what's wrong with my body and fix it. I have a mother who is caring and is willing to cook and care for me, and a sister who does the same. I have the freedom to pursue my interest in this break, and I have no major responsibilities or ties that can promote stress and anxiety, although most of it is self-inflicted and arises in my own work assigned by the high expectations I set for myself. I have a place to call home and a family who is helping me get back on my feet. That alone should be enough reason to not be depressed about not being in the US. Everything else, the friends I have in my life, the books, programming pursuits, and art, are blessings that I shouldn't take for granted.\n\nI'll drop some notes on the Proust book tomorrow. Until then.\n","data":{"title":"Going Back Home","tags":"journal","date":"Jan 6, 2024"},"filePath":"backhome.md"},{"content":"\nSome notes & questions from reading [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/).\n\n- **values**\n  - `let` for constants, `var` for variables\n  - `\\(var)` for string variables (kinda weird)\n- **control flow**\n  - parentheses around conditions optional, braces around body (like JS)\n  - write `if` or `switch` after `=` (inline conditional)\n  - optionals:\n    - `?` after value to mark value as **optional**\n    - `if let` to create optional variables\n    - `??` to use default value if optional value is missing\n  - `_` can be used like in Python for unnamed vars\n  - tuples like Python\n  - switch case supports any kind of data\n  - `..<` to make range of index\n    - ex: `0..<4` is 0 to 3, and `0...<4` includes 4\n- `func`\n  - functions are first-class types, it can return another function as its value and cane take a function as an argument\n  - **closures**\n    - functions are a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later\n    - code in closure can access to variables and functions available in scope where closure was created, even if in a different scope when executed\n- `class`\n  - declare methods and functions within class\n    - dot syntax to access properties and methods\n    - init to create initializer\n    - `deinit` for cleanup before object is deallocated\n  - subclasses\n    - `super.init` to access superclass init\n    - `override func myFunc()` to override superclass implementation\n  - `get` and `set`\n    - set explicit name like this `set(newVal)` or `newValue` is the implicit name\n  - `willSet` and `didSet`\n    - run code before and after setting new values\n  - optional values: write `?` before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting\n- `enum`\n  - Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them\n  - case values are actual values\n  - raw values start at 0 and increment by one each time\n  - use abbreviated forms (`.value`) anytime the value's type is already known\n- `struct`\n  - ex: initializers are enums, and can initialize with abbreviated form\n  - always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\n- `async await`\n  - how to use\n    - `async` to mark function that runs asynchronously\n    - call with `await`\n    - use `async let` to call async function and let it run parallel with other async code\n  - Tasks\n    - use `Task` to call async func from sync code, without waiting for them to return\n    - use `withTaskGroup` to structure concurrent code\n  - **actors**\n    - similar to classes, but they ensure that different asynchronous functions can safely interact with an instance of the same actor at the same time.\n    - use `await` keyword when calling a method on an actor or accessing one of its properties\n- `protocol`\n  - Classes, enumerations, and structures can all adopt protocols.\n  - use `mutating func` in `struct` when writing methods that modifies structure\n  - classes don't require marking as mutating because methods can always modify the class.\n  - `extension`\n    - add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties\n    - ex: add methods and props like this to Int type `7.simpleDescription` or `7.adjust()`\n  - can be used like a named type\n    - ex: objects of different types all conform to a single protocol\n    - when type is a **boxed protocol type**, methods outside protocol definitions aren't available\n    - ensures no accidental access of methods or properties the class implements in addition to its protocol conformance\n- error handling\n  - `throw` to throw error\n  - `throws` to mark a function that can throw errors\n  - ways to handle\n    - `do-catch`:\n      - in `do`, write `try` in front of code\n      - in `catch`, errors are given name `error` by default\n    - multiple catch blocks\n      - handle specific errors\n      - name errors like `catch let printerError as PrinterError` (`PrinterError` is enum which adopts `Error` protocol)\n    - optionals\n      - `try?`: if function throws error, specific error is discarded and result is nill, else result is optional containing the value returned by function\n    - `defer`\n      - block of code that is executed after all other code, just before function return\n      - executed regardless of error or not\n      - can write setup code and cleanup code next to each other\n- generics: `<myGeneric>`\n  - there are generic forms of func and methods, as well as class, enum, and structs.\n  - use `where` to specify list of requirements\n    - require type to implement a protocol, require to types to be equivalent, to require a class to have a particular superclass, etc.\n\nthoughts\n\n- unwrapping values\n  - feel like this will be used a lot in ios dev, I use this a lot in react\n- closures\n  - ({}) to write closers\n- custom argument labels in functions\n- raw values\n  - another name for default values in an enum?\n- structs\n  - why is this important? \"structures are always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\"\n- concurrency\n  - what does calling async functions from sync code mean?\n- task groups\n  - is task group basically a grouper for async?\n- is actor basically classes but with async features\n- is it common to extend types?\n- how often is protocol used? seems like it's a way to enforce some properties of a class\n- is generic a type of types?\n\nAfter thought:\n\nThis was my first time reading through the docs of a new programming language, coming from R initially from Coursera, and Python with textbooks and hackathons, and hacking with Typescript for React and Next.js for side projects, I discovered I have a lot of gaps in programming knowledge. I've never used struct and protocols, and a lot of other concepts were foreign to me. It feels like I'm actually learning how to program for real.\n\nIt can only go up from here.

I find intrinsic motivation the most powerful generator for focus. If it's something that provides meaning and purpose, it induces flow, and flow is focus.\nIf you're not intrinsically motivated, utilize extrinsic motivation, make finishing the task satisfying and reward yourself with what you find rewarding.\n\nSet accountability strategies, I stream myself working because there's a sense of someone watching me and provides the pressure. Tell your friends/the public about your plans, that way failing has a \"cost\", your risk appearing untrustworthy and breaking a social contract. Make failing painful. Make it hurt.\n","data":{"title":"Tools for Keeping Focus","tags":"work","date":"Jan 3, 2024"},"filePath":"focus.md"},{"content":"\nIt's the start of a new year.\n\nWhat better way to start, than learning about learning, for programmers.\n\nThe day before, I wrote about learning to code. Today, we go one step further and learn about learning itself.\n\nBelow outlines [10](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2024/1/278891-10-things-software-developers-should-learn-about-learning/fulltext) research-backed findings about learning that apply to software developers, and their practical implications.\n\n### tl;dr\n\n- learning takes time, including time between learning. use spaced repetition. take breaks between learning sessions (90 min)\n- learn to chunk information by practicing more problems, recognizing patterns, to boost your working memory functionally and build up a mental library of patterns\n- spend time away from a problem, take a walk, chat with friends and family\n- internet and AI is a double-edged sword, use it cautiously, if your goal is to learn, think of an answer before searching, understand the answer deeply, go one step further, learn the deeper structure\n- use examples to go between abstract and concrete learnable facts (repacking <-> unpacking)\n- seek to succeed (rather than avoid failures) and believe that ability is changeable, that struggles are not dead ends but an opportunity to grow\n\n### 1. Human memory is not made of bits\n\n> tl;dr: human memory is fragile and unreliable, we're not just storing and retrieving like computers. but the benefit is problem solving and deep understanding by connecting knowledge together.\n\n- memory and learning: \"Learning means that there has been a change made in one's long-term memory.\"\n- with computers, we can store a series of bits and later retrieve the exact series of bits in memory; human memory is neither as precise nor as reliable.\n- computers have two operations: read and write. human memory has \"**read-and-update**\" operation, where fetching a memory can both strengthen and modify it – a process called <mark>reconsolidation</mark>.\n  - modification is more likely on recently formed memories\n- <mark>spreading activation</mark>: when trying to remember something, we activate a pathway of neurons to access the targeted information\n  - pathways can stay **primed for hours**\n  - this activation is not contained within one pathway, and cat spread to other connected pathways\n  - implications\n    - negative: recall can be unreliable as imprecise information can be mixed and conflated with target information\n    - positive: stepping away from problems can allow two unrelated areas to connect, arising creative and unique solutions. this is why taking walks and showers helps.\n\n### 2. Human memory has one limited and one unlimited system\n\n> tl;dr: when faced with a task beyond your ability, reorganize it, decompose it into smaller pieces that can be processed and chunked. reduces extraneous load, boost working memory.\n\n- two main components of memory\n  - **long-term memory**: information is permanently stored and is functionally limitless\n    - analogy: computer disk storage\n  - **working memory** (wm): used for consciously reasoning about information for problem solving and is limited.\n    - analogy: CPU registers\n- long-term vs wm\n  - wm is roughly fixed at birth, higher wm != higher general intelligence, but faster learning.\n  - ex: expert programmers can have low or high wm but it's contents of their long-term memory that mke them experts\n- <mark>chunking</mark>\n  - group multiple piece of information as one piece in wm\n    - ex: ben@gmail.com is one piece of information, and not a random string of characters\n  - more chunking == larger working memory, functionally\n  - how to chunk? practice using information and solving problems\n- <mark>cognitive load</mark>\n  - is amount of working memory **capacity**, demanded by task.\n  - two parts: intrinsic and extraneous\n    - **intrinsic**: how many chunks are necessary to achieve a task\n    - **extraneous**: unnecessary information that is part of performing the task\n    - ex: presentation format varies extraneous cognitive load. a implementing a a database schema is better with diagrams than plain text (you have to mentally transform them)\n    - **if you're a beginner, extraneous load is higher** because you can't distinguish intrinsic and extraneous easily.\n\n### 3. experts recognize, beginners reason.\n\n> tl;dr: experts can reason at higher level by pulling from their mental library of patterns, freeing up cognition.\n\n- cognition is split into system 1 & 2\n  - System 1: fast, pattern recognition in long-term memory\n  - System 2: slower, reasoning in working memory\n- experts are experts because they've done <mark>pattern matching</mark> a lot more than beginners. like chess players who can remember and recognize the state of the board, programmers recognize \"design patterns\"\n- beginners can become experts by reading and understanding a lot of code\n- seeing a variety of programming paradigms so you have a wide pool of patterns.\n\n### 4. understanding a concept goes from abstract to concrete and back\n\n> tl;dr: experts look at generics and abstract ters, beginners focus on surface details and can't see the big picture\n\n- making <mark>[semantic waves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0898589812000678)</mark>\n  - when learning a new concept, you benefit from both forms of explanation: abstract features and concrete details with examples, and **switching between them**.\n  - <mark>unpacking</mark>: gather several diverse examples (even wrong ones) of a concept to learn an abstract concept\n  - <mark>repacking</mark>: deeper understanding through recognizing how multiple details from examples connects to the abstract concept\n- abstract -> concrete\n  - when learning abstract concepts, you reach for concrete instantiations of concepts to examine\n  - as concepts get more abstract (values -> variables -> functions -> metaclasses), distance to concrete examples increases\n  - the saving grace is, as we learn abstract concepts, they become more concrete (a chunk) to us.\n\n### 5. Spacing and repetition matter\n\n> tl;dr: space out practice across multiple sessions, days, and ideally weeks, rest is important to consolidate information\n\n- <mark>spacing effect</mark>\n  - works because of relationship between long-term & working memory\n  - when practice solving problems, it's two skills\n    - 1\\) **match**: pattern matching information to concepts that can solve it\n      - requires activating correct neural pathway in long-term memory\n    - 2\\) **apply**: applying the concepts to create solutions\n  - why space out?\n    - if you repeatedly solve the same problem, pathway stays active, so skill #1 is not practiced.\n    - not spacing out -> people can only solve problems when told which concept to use\n    - interleaving different problems -> pathways take time to return to baseline, making spacing necessary to get the most out of practice time (because your brain needs to rest and reset)\n- learning sessions\n  - limit to <mark>90 minutes or less</mark>\n  - take 20 minutes to rest after each session, really rest by going for a walk / sitting quietly\n  - rest speeds up consolidation process (also happens during sleep)\n- maximizing efficiency for learning\n  - **randomize order** of type of problems being solved, so different concepts are activated in long-term memory\n  - take **short breaks** at random intervals to enhance memory consolidation\n    - 10s break every 2-5 min is recommended\n\n### 6. internet has not made learning obsolete\n\n> tl;dr: be more careful about using AI as beginners, try to think of an answer before searching. there's a difference between a beginner who has never learned the details and lacks memory connection, and an expert who has learned deeper structure but has forgotten the fine details.\n\n- AI tools can write code, and knowledge is available from internet within seconds, but do you understand/learn anything?\n- learning is required to become an expert\n  - learning = storing bits of knowledge in long-term memory and <mark>forming connections</mark> between them\n  - if knowledge is not present in the brain, it's because you have not learned it well, and the brain cannot form any connections between them\n  - higher levels of understanding and abstraction are not possible\n- why searching internet bad\n  - less efficient for remembering information (compared to physical books)\n  - immediately searching is worse recall of same information, rather than thinking of an answer first\n  - searching robs the brain of benefits of memory-strengthening effect of recalling information\n- context switching\n  - searching requires switching working memory from task at hand (coding) to a new cognitive task (searching and filtering and assessing)\n  - if the knowledge is memorized, access is much faster (like a cache verses fetching from disk)\n\n### 7. problem-solving is not a generic skill\n\n> tl;dr: teaching problem-solving != teaching programming, we learn specific skills like programming, the best chess move, how to create a knitting pattern, each of these skills are separate and don't influence each other. teach programming with programming practice problems\n\n- problem-solving & programming\n  - problem-solving is a large part, but you can't directly teach it as a specific skill\n  - even though it can be applied to different aspects of programming (design, debugging), it's not a generic skill\n- domain-specific problem-solving > generic\n  - while we can learn to reason, <>we don't learn how to solve problems in general</mark>\n  - we learn specific skills and they are separate and don't influence each other\n  - ex: chess has little to no effect on other academic and cognitive skills.\n- spatial skills is an exception\n  - allows us to visualize objects in our mind\n  - can improve learning in other disciplines: such as performance on a range of non-verbal skills\n\n### 8. expertise can be problematic in some situations\n\n> tl;dr: experts who transfer knowledge from one language to another can lead to faulty knowledge. they also have difficulties seeing things through a beginner's lens.\n\n- transfer knowledge\n  - experts know multiple programming languages, and transferring knowledge between them can lead to errors\n  - ex: difference in semantics between languages between Java and C++ in inheritance\n- <mark>expert blind-spot problem</mark>\n  - experts have difficulty seeing things through the eyes of a beginner\n  - overcome this by listening carefully to beginners, check their understanding, and tailor accordingly\n- <mark>tacit knowledge</mark>\n  - knowledge becomes so automated that it's hard for experts to verbalize: \"i just know\"\n  - beginners can learn better from instructional materials or a knowledgable peer (bridges the gap between beginners and experts)\n\n### 9. predictors of programming ability are unclear\n\n> tl;dr: intelligent people will not always make good programmers, and good programmers need not be high in general intelligence.\n\n- aptitude + practice\n  - a mix of this is needed for success in anything\n  - purely aptitude \"you're born with it\" and purely practice \"10,000 hours\" idea are two extreme views.\n- years of experience?\n  - there is weak link between years of experience and success in early career\n  - aptitude may be stronger than experience in early years\n- weak predictors\n  - (in early programming) **general intelligence** and **working memory capacity**\n  - these predict <mark>rate of learning</mark> rather than absolute ability\n  - spatial reasoning is a stronger predictor of success in programming, though still quite moderate\n\n### 10. mindset matters\n\n> tl;dr: a growth mindset helps you persist through challenges and overcome failures, but it takes effort to adopt the mindset. Seek help, take breaks, just because you're struggling doesn't mean you're not cut out for it.\n\n- programming ability is not binary: you can or cannot\n  - two theories\n    - <mark>learning edge momentum</mark>: each topic is dependent on the previous, so you will fall behind if you can't catch up\n    - geek gene: you're born with it or not (little empirical evidence)\n  - difference in programming ability = difference in prior experience\n    - ex: person A and B in same class, degree can have vastly different knowledge skills, either behind or ahead of learning edge momentum, making them seem \"born with it\" or not\n- fixed vs growth mindset\n  - **fixed mindset**: people's abilities are innate and unchanging. if you struggle, you're not cut out for it\n  - <mark>growth mindset</mark>: people's abilities are malleable. if you struggle, **with enough practice**, you can master it.\n  - the middle ground: anyone can learn Math, even if they're not initially good, but you won't get a Nobel Prize no matter how much you practice. However, with a growth mindset, you can **persist through difficulties and overcome failure more consistently**\n- growth mindset is hard to promote, misconceptions\n  - #1 reward effort than performance\n    - growth mindset favors practice over aptitude, so teachers reward effort, but learners aren't stupid, they know when they're not progressing.\n    - solution: only reward effort when learner is using effective strategies and is actually succeeding\n  - #2 growth mindset is static\n    - due to set backs and failure, people skew toward fixed mindset because the boundaries of their abilities are not clear\n    - solution: practice overcoming setbacks and failures\n- goal orientation: <mark>approach & avoidance</mark>\n  - **approach**: wanting to do well -> positive learning behaviours: working hard, seeking help, trying new challenges\n  - **avoidance**: avoiding failure -> negative behaviours: disorganized study, not seeking help, performance anxiety, avoiding challenge\n- how to adopt growth mindset\n  - seek honest feedback about your skill progression\n  - review the efficacy of your learning strategies\n    - note down times when you are doubtful\n  - expect shifts towards fixed mindset, but growth mindset can be redeveloped and made stronger with practice\n  - if you feel like quitting, take a break, take a walk, consider different strategies\n","data":{"title":"On Learning (for programmers)","tags":"programming","date":"Jan 2, 2024"},"filePath":"learning-programmers.md"},{"content":"\nLearning [how to program](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#skills1) is a complex skill.\n\nYou won't reach the skill level of a hacker by simply accumulating languages.\n\nYou need to learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language.\n\nYou should reach a point where you can pick up a new language in days by relating to what you already know to the manual.\n\nSo what is the way?\n\nIs it books and courses?

I'm grateful I get to see all these places.\n\nIt's time to review my 2023.\n\nI've written some reflections on my life in my [birthday](http://bneo.xyz/posts/22) post and my [graduation](http://bneo.xyz/posts/isu) post, now it's time to answer some reflective questions, and look forward to 2024.\n\nIn an ideal world, I would be moving to the bay, maybe back with Tesla, dealing with housing, OPT documents, work contracts, getting a car and paying for car insurance, meeting up with my friends on the weekends, going to more events and hackathons, and live the life I wanted every since I started at INTI in 2019.\n\nBut life is never the way we plan, and there are things we cannot escape from, events out of our control.\n\nHowever, I'm doing grad school, so I have another shot at this.\n\nI had a hiatus back in 2020 when COVID hit, and it was 6 months of reading, learning, and exercising. So 2024 seems familiar to me, I'm going to have another gap break before my graduate school starts in Fall 24', but with more intention, bigger goals, and greater purpose.\n\nMy main goal is to fix the many issues of my body, dive into research and find the root cause, and get surgery to end the 3 years of suffering. I was stuck in the US, unable to get proper health care and support, so coming back was necessary.\n\nIf my health permits, I'm also going to explore my wide array of interests, and commit to learning, and more importantly, **building** everyday. Habits are essential to learning, so I aim to pick up some daily habits for coding and reading, like how I'm doing in this blog.\n\nTo really reflect upon, and look forward to the new year, I've answered a list of questions from Twitter.\n\n### Capture\n\n1.

I like building things that can solve problems, especially if they're important, social issues that can be tackled with technology. This is why I'm addicted to hackathons, they give me the motivation for building. But now that I'm out of school, and I have more time, I'm going to start committing to one idea, and see how far it can go, and build properly with my friend [WC](https://weichun.xyz/).\n\nSome notes on \"[The Hacker Attitude](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude)\" by Eric\n\nA hacker solves problems and builds things. They believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help.\n\nTo become a hacker, you have to behave as though you have this kind of attitude yourself.\n\nAs with all creative arts, the most effective way is to imitate the mindset of masters – not just intellectually but emotionally as well.\n\nSo if you want to be a hacker, you have to repeat the following things until you believe them:\n\n1. The world is full of fascinating problems **waiting to be solved**.\n   - being a hacker is a lot of fun, but the kind of fun that takes a lot of energy\n   - **intrinsic motivation**: you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence\n   - **faith**: you have to develop a belief that even though you don't have all the pieces to solve a problem, you can learn and solve it piece by piece, and do that until you're done.\n2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.\n   - **don't reinvent the wheel**: creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. don't waste time re-addressing old problems, there are many fascinating new problems out there\n   - **share**: it's almost a moral duty to share information, solve problems and give solutions away so hackers can solve new problems\n3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.\n   - **solve new problems**: hackers should never be bored or have have to drudge at stupid repetitive work. This wastefulness hurts everybody.\n   - **automate**: automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everybody else\n4. Freedom is good.\n   - naturally **anti-authoritarian**: anyone who can give orders can find some stupid reason to stop you from solving problems you're fascinated by, fight the authoritarian attitude wherever you find it.\n   - **cooperate and share information**: develop an instinctive hostility to censorship, secrecy, and use of force or deception to compel responsible adults.\n5. Attitude is **no substitute** for competence.\n   - attitude alone is not enough, it takes intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work.\n   - distrust attitude and **respect competence of every kind**\n   - competence at demanding skills that few can master is especially good, and ones that involve mental acuteness, craft, and concentration is best.\n   - if you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself – the <mark>hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than drudgery</mark>\n\nMore resources\n\n- PG's essay, [Great Hackers](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html) and [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html)\n- [Things Every Hacker Once Knew](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/things-every-hacker-once-knew)\n- [How To Ask Smart Questions](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)\n","data":{"title":"The Hacker Attitude","tags":"programming","date":"Dec 29, 2023"},"filePath":"hacker.md"},{"content":"\nI like [MUJI](https://www.muji.com/us/feature/whatismuji/) products a lot.\n\nThey have an eye in creating pure and fresh products that are simple and low-cost, but good quality\n\nThe philosophy behind their design is a sentiment of \"This will do\" towards their products.\n\n> This is because we do not make objects to entice responses of strong affinity, like, “This is what I really want” or, “I must have this.” MUJI’s goal is to give customers a rational satisfaction, expressed not with, “This is what I really want” but with “This will do.” “This is what I really want” expresses both faint egoism and discord, while “This will do” expresses conciliatory reasoning. In fact, it may even incorporate resignation and a little dissatisfaction. MUJI’s goal is to sweep away that slight dissatisfaction, and raise the level of the response, “This will do” to one filled with clarity and confidence.\n\nI wonder if this concept can extend to software products. A lot of software today has dark patterns hiding behind vibrant and colorful buttons and icons, designed to hack our attention and overstimulate us. Maybe we need more software that makes us go, \"This will do\".\n","data":{"title":"What is MUJI?","tags":"design","date":"Dec 28, 2023"},"filePath":"muji.md"},{"content":"\nThe selection of people who we choose to inspire us is one of life's most important choices.\n\nWho you interact with shapes you irrevocably.

in the two-story modern airbnb apartment in Beacon Hill.\n\nMy alarm woke me up at 7:30 a.m., I thought there would be a sunrise today. It was just clouds.\n\nI tried to go back to sleep, but ended up scrolling twitter and cosmos.\n\nI finally got out of bed to eat breakfast at 10:30 a.m.\n\nIt was raining outside. You could only see the faint outline of the city. The mountains were hidden behind the fog.\n\nI sat with my family on the second floor to have oatmeal drenched in flaxmilk, cut bananas and apples, and tasty sweet potato chips from whole foods.\n\nMy family commented about how new the airbnb is, and my dad started discussing about credit card bills.\n\nI continued scrolling twitter.\n\nI felt a little sick after, and went back to lie on the bed.\n\nI wanted to work on my birth of Christ sketch.\n\nMy sister cracked open the window behind us.\n\nThe sound of the rain and the slight breeze made me sleepy.\n\nI fell asleep at some point.\n\nI woke up at 3:30 p.m. with the tablet in my hands.\n\nMy sister and dad went to Safeway to get soy sauce.\n\nI got on twitter again.\n\nI felt better now, and continued my sketch upstairs at the kitchen countertop.\n\nMy other sister and my mum watched youtube on the tv above the fireplace.\n\nI finished my sketch, I felt satisfied with the end result. I took two breaks for this sketch, I usually finish sketches in one sitting because I don't have the patience nor the accountability to finish them if I don't.\n\nI continued going on rabbit-holes, organizing my tabs, and writing blogs for the rest of the year.\n\nMy sister started cooking dinner with the meat we bought from whole foods last night.\n\nThe fire alarm kept going off because of the smoke.\n\nWe cracked every window and the cold breeze came uninvited to the living room, colliding with the heavy smell of fatty meat crawling from the kitchen, travelling across the entire apartment.\n\nAn old friend from church called, she's 7 months pregnant. I'm reminded of my younger self and feel old. Time is moving fast.\n\nI pan-fry my salmon. The flesh is golden and the skin is crisp, I plated it thinking it was done but it was slightly undercooked. I put it back.\n\nThe fire alarm went off again.\n\nMy sister took out the French lamb rack from the oven, it smells good.\n\nIt was finally time to eat. It's 8 p.m.\n\nThere were baked vegetables and potatoes, stir-fried brocolli, steak, lamb, and salmon.\n\nWe talked about plans for tomorrow, about the meal, about the trip, and about the future.\n\nThe lamb was really good. The meat was tender and the flavor rich.\n\nI got heartburn from the fattiness of the meat. I couldn't feel happy.\n\nI went to take a shower and went to bed.\n\nI started planning the spots to hit tomorrow and the day after.\n\nI spent the rest of the night discovering and organizing information, and writing these blogs. I haven't been doing anything else lately. I like doing it. I finally get to just do this and nothing else. It's a privilege. It's an addiction. Maybe a distraction too.\n\nIt's now 12:50 a.m.\n\nThis was my Christmas day.\n","data":{"title":"Christmas in Seattle","tags":"journal","date":"Dec 25, 2023"},"filePath":"christmas-seattle.md"},{"content":"\n[Design books](https://www.stripe.press/recommended/design-books.html) for non-designers, recommended by [Stripe](https://stripe.press/) Design team.\n\n1. **Beauty** by SAGMEISTER & WALSH\n2. **The Design of Everyday Things** by DONALD A.

If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse.\n\n[Second-order thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/) is the practice of not just considering the consequences of our decisions, but also the <mark>consequences of those consequences</mark>.\n\nEveryone can do first-order thinking, which is just the immediate anticipated result of an action. It's quick and requires little effort. Second-order thinking is more complex and time-consuming, but it can get you extraordinary results.\n\nHere's an example in [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/), as described by the man himself.\n\n> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”\n\nIn it's most concise version, Chesterton's Fence states:\n\n\"Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.\"\n\nSome examples of 2nd order thinking\n\n- hierarchy-free companies: removing structure altogether at companies doesn't address why hierarchies must exist in the first place; people will form hierarchies, which is far more complex to navigate, where the most charismatic will take control, rather than the most qualified\n- company culture: chief financial officer cutting cost by doing away the free snacks and sodas. this can prompt talent to jump ship, costing far more in employee turnover in an attempt to save a relatively small amount of money\n- habits: removing a bad habit, without eliminating the need or replacing it with a better one, can lead to a more harmful habit to take its place\n\nSo what's the takeaway?\n\nIt's not that you can't make improvements.\n\nIt's a reminder that we don't always know better than the people who made decisions before us, and we can't see all the nuances to a situation until we're intimate with it.\n\nUnless you know why someone made a decision, you can't safely change it or conclude they were wrong.\n\nThe first step is to understand it. Observe it fully. Notice how it interconnects with other aspects, especially the ones not linked to you closely.\n\nLearn how it works, then propose a change.\n","data":{"title":"Second Order Thinking","tags":"thinking","date":"Dec 23, 2023"},"filePath":"secondorder.md"},{"content":"\n![Advice to Subscribers, published in Le Charivari, April 1, 1840](/images/advice.jpeg)\n\n[Thirteen bits of advice](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/advice-for-new-software-devs-whove-read-all-those/) for early-career programmers from the [Computer Things](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/) newsletter.\n\n1. People listen to you because you're a **good writer**, not because you're a good programmer. Take any argument about \"objective truth\" with a grain of salt.\n2. Don't be worried about learning \"the wrong thing\", **learning is all about trying new ideas** and making mistakes, and iterating from them.\n3. Read [Debugging: The 9 rules](https://debuggingrules.com/), it's an important skill that beginners lack\n4. At some point you'll discover the **Right Way** to program, it could be TDD, functional, OOP or a million other things, and be convinced this is the only way. You'll learn that programming is frustrating and messy regardless of which Right Way people use, and you can make great software without it. You'll learn that there are 50 other Right Ways and learn to mix and match with the problem at hand\n5. Don't hold it against the Right Way Guy who introduced you to the Right Way; **most ideas need some modification** from their purest form to integrate well with other ideas.\n6. \"behind every best practice is a horror story.\" - [Julie Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30YWsGDr8mA). if you don't understand the best practice, look for the horror story that inspired it. it might be irrelevant to you, and you can do a different practice instead.\n7. A lot of best practices and conventions are \"**path dependent**\", arising from a mix of historical and cultural factors. retrace the whole path and see if the things everyone is doing that is not as relevant anymore.\n8. <mark>Take walks</mark>\n9. Almost every tool has a **form of hidden depth**, from Python to git to Jira. Don't feel like you have to become an expert in all of them, but spend 5-10 minutes learning a bi more about what they can do.\n10. **Talk to people in other parts of the company**: support, sales, finance, etc. shadow them if you have the time.\n11. **Try different types of programming** earlier in your career. Most companies are doing several different kinds of programming, if you're starting in web dev, try some frontend, backend, ops, some data stuff. This helps you learn, and more importantly increases your chances of finding software work you actually like.\n12. Don't get swept up in framework treadmill, **focus on learning fundamental skills**. Why? information in software propagates really quickly due to (internet, OSS, conferences), and overall there's a lower barrier to sharing ideas in software. If you're excited about something, go ahead and be an early adopter, otherwise, wait a few years for it to grow legs.\n13. No one can predict the future. **Do the best you can, live according to your values, and enjoy the ride**.\n","data":{"title":"Advice for Starting Programmers","tags":"programming, advice","date":"Dec 22, 2023"},"filePath":"advice-programmers.md"},{"content":"\n![The Artist's Garden at Giverny, 1900 by Claude Monet](/images/giverny.jpg)\n\nI love [Monet's garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Garden_at_Giverny?useskin=vector) in [Giverney](https://artsandculture.google.com/usergallery/impressionism-monet-s-lily-garden-in-giverny/ggKyII_ttwaVIA).

It's seen as a weekend task involving fighting with a lawn mower and is something people to do when they retire.\n\nIt's practical not philosophical, physical not metaphysical. It's not discussed seriously\n\nGardening can be a tool to combat the increasingly obvious and dangerous effect of climate change.\n\nGardening should happen everywhere.\n\n> I am a gardener. I can’t think of a more important responsibility. Gardening is not just a set of tasks. It’s not restricted to backyards, courtyards, balconies. It can, and should, happen anywhere, everywhere. Gardening is simply a framework for engagement with our world, grounded in care, action and intimacy with place. To garden is to care deeply, inclusively and audaciously for the world outside our homes and our heads. It’s a way of being that is intimately interwoven with the real truths of existence—not the things we’re told to value (money, status, ownership), but the things that actually matter (sustenance, perspective, beauty, connection, growth).\n\nWe need to be gardeners to protect our planet.\n\n> To be a gardener is to be invested in a place — to know it, to protect it, to be present to it.

Accumulation\n   - time spent together is the most obvious force: it takes [40-60 hours](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225) within the first 6 weeks to turn acquaintance into casual friend, and 80-100 hours to become more than that\n   - “Being around someone 24 hours a day, you tell them everything, ... You don’t do [that] when you are home.”\n2. Attention\n   - there are more opportunities than you think to make friends\n   - “You have to look for friendship in places you would never expect it.\n   - pay attention, notice when you click with someone, be open to chance encounters, step out of your habits and into the moments\n3. Intention\n   - you need action, when opportunity arises, have the courage, vulnerability, and willingness to let things be awkward.\n   - friendship takes energy and thought; they take work. showing up for your friends take effort, but it should be joy.\n4. Ritual\n   - have something baked into your schedule so all you have to do is show up\n   - book clubs, monthly hikes, dinner parties, group chats than run all day, etc.\n5. Imagination\n   - society places friendship on the sideline, it's playing supporting roles to work, family, and romance; design your life so friendship plays the role you want\n   - ex: buying a house together, going therapy together, raising their children together, friends are people who choose to love each other radically every day.\n6. Grace\n   - the previous forces are ideas, they're impossible to fully live up to. life gets in the way\n   - friendship is flexible, it can bend to fit the shape of our lives.\n   - it doesn't always have to be about presence, it can be love that can weather absence\n   - the concept of grace: a gift so profound that it can never be earned or deserved\n     - offer forgiveness to each other when we fall short\n     - create a space for connection, and reconnections, that feel nothing short of miraculous.\n","data":{"title":"6 Forces That Fuel Friendship","tags":"friends","date":"Dec 20, 2023"},"filePath":"friendshipforces.md"},{"content":"\n![View of the Gift of the Emperor's Gift Cup – Yōshū (Hashimoto) Chikanobu](/images/gift.jpeg)\n\n> The currency in a gift economy is relationship, which is expressed as gratitude, as interdependence and the ongoing cycles of reciprocity. A gift economy nurtures the community bonds that enhance mutual well-being; the economic unit is “we” rather than “I,” as all flourishing is mutual.\n\nWhat makes a good gift?\n\nSome notes and ideas about gift giving from this piece on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/blog/gift-shop-talk).\n\n- everyone’s idea of a good gift is so different; One’s own standards for gifts does not necessarily apply to everyone\n- there is some kind of quality of empathy or something — really understanding the person you’re giving the gift to\n- the best gifts are usually from people who know you really well, and in a particular way\n- good gift givers are also very good at listening and then remembering that one thing you said that one time about wanting something\n- \"I also love when people give me playlists for my birthday\"\n- it’s that foresight, or the fact that someone has been thinking about you as they buy or make somethings\n- pragmatic gifts: “I don’t know this person that well, but I know they live in New York. If they’re like me, they probably don’t want another physical object for their small apartment. I’m going to give them something that will naturally disappear — something ephemeral — like flowers, incense, candles, etc.”\n- a good gift has an element of surprise — that’s key\n- the best gift is when it’s something you want and you’re positive that the other person would want it too, because you can feel like there’s an overlap of what you can both feel excited about.\n- [gift economy](https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/the-serviceberry/), or reorienting your thinking around gifts and abundance rather than scarcity, changes our whole relationship to the world\n- gift-giving promotes a sense of reciprocity.\n- The first thing that you feel when you get a gift is gratitude, and the second is reciprocity, you want to give a gift in return.

The fundamental question is whether your skill is good enough for your taste.\n\nRight now, you could be in one of two scenarios\n\n### Taste > Skill\n\nwhen your taste is ahead of your skills, you are not satisfied with the work you produce.\n\nevery time you're unhappy with your work, it just means your taste for what is good is ahead of what you're able to create.\n\nThis is good. This means your skill has room to grow.\n\nYou have a voice in your head saying you can do better., a reference point of something you aren't able to achieve yet\n\n### Skill >= Taste\n\nWhen your skill is equal or higher than your taste, you're able to build what you believe is good.\n\nYou're happy with your work, but you also stop growing, unless you grow your taste first.\n\nThis dynamic between taste and skill is crucial.\n\n<mark>Skill is your floor, taste is your ceiling</mark>\n\nThe most effective way to improve your taste is by being **exposed** to what is good.\n\nTo create a good team, you have to work in one.\n\nThis makes good taste more valuable than good skills, the latter is easier to catch up with.\n\n### Closing the gap\n\nIf great taste is knowing what's good, and great skill is knowing how to build things, the third element is knowing why.\n\nKnow **what makes good things good**\n\nYou may study hundreds of artworks or great design work, and develop intuitive taste for good ones.\n\nBut unless you create your own designs, or paint or sketch, you learn what makes good things good, and ultimately allowing your **taste to turn into skills**\n\nThus, the two ways to help with closing the gap is:\n\n- just build stuff: your bad output constantly triggers your reasoning, question yourself \"why do I think this is crap?\"\n- discuss with others: elaborate on your judgement in your discussions. if you disagree on something being good, chances are you want to figure out why.\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- grow your taste – expose yourself to high-quality stuff\n- grow your skills on something you already have good taste for – e.g. learning design as a programmer\n- combine your taste and skills in a unique way – you know good design (taste) and you can code (skill)\n\nThis unique combination can help you decide what to work on and what to build as an entrepreneur.\n\nIt helps answer \"why me?\", and gives you the answer to these two important questions:\n\n- Why are you better positioned than most other people for doing that?\n- Why do you have a special shot at being successful?\n","data":{"title":"Taste > Skill","tags":"ideas, work","date":"Dec 18, 2023"},"filePath":"taste-skill.md"},{"content":"\nSome [advice](https://enlightenedcaveman.com/2006/06/25/advice_for_new_college_grads/) for new college grads by Chris from 2006.\n\nIt's advice that was written down 17 years ago, yet is still as, or more, important today.\n\n- amount of happiness ∝ amount of frustration\n  - frustration is all about unmet expectations, learn to set your expectation about life realistically.\n  - when you find yourself dissatisfied, ask yourself what you expected, and **ask yourself why you expected what you did**.\n- Good things in life take work\n  - in careers (work extra hard in your 20s) and in relationship (like taking care of a plant)\n  - don't expect getting to good life will be easy.\n- Rethink what you **really** want\n  - if you want to be rich, why?

I'm done. I finally get to leave Ames, Iowa.\n\nI remember back in INTI college in Malaysia when my friends and I were all applying for schools, I just went along with my friends and only applied for this school.\n\nI figured that would save money on the applications, and ISU was the most optimal choice for credit transfers, tuition and living cost, and friends.\n\nLooking back, I definitely would've applied to other schools. After California, I saw that the grass was greener. I could've had a better college life, made more friends, and got better internships.\n\nBut, I have to be grateful for the opportunity to study in the US. It's not an opportunity every Malaysian gets.\n\nI'm blessed to have a father who works hard to fund my educational and career goals.\n\nI'm going grad school anyways, I have a second shot at a \"college experience\", whatever that is.\n\nMy time here at Ames was pretty depressing. But there were good moments.\n\nThe beginning of it was nice, everything was new.\n\nNew apartment, new housemates, new classrooms, new weather, new life.\n\nIt was my first step into adulting.\n\nI started buying my own groceries, cooking my own meals, researched the best credit cards, managed my finances, paid taxes. Applied for jobs, interviewed, and learned how to communicate with people.\n\nA lot of \"adulting\" boxes that I wouldn't check if I stayed back home.\n\nWhat would be a fun college life experience in a small, quiet town is quickly filled with pain and suffering, inconveniences and boredom.\n\nWhile a normal student would go through issues of hard classes and bad grades, breakups, financial difficulties, sport injuries, I had to learn how to survive with GERD.\n\nIt creeps up on my life in all aspects.\n\nIn my sleep, my daily meals, my activities, every second of my life.\n\nDifficulty breathing. Heartburn. Sore throat. Stabbing pain on my stomach. A constant feeling of discomfort with my body. I've never felt myself since January 2021.\n\nIt was suffocating. I contemplated stopping college in the second semester when I had trouble eating and swallowing.\n\nHaving chronic health issues and being an international student are two things that contradict and are in conflict with each other. It doesn't make sense to be >8000 miles away and not be healthy. It made me realize and relate to the sad truth of how so many people cannot afford healthcare here in the US, such a basic right of human beings, and how it's much harder for me to achieve my dreams in the US.\n\nGoing to California was a breath of fresh air. I got to experience the bay area. The Silicon Valley. It was what I dreamt about when I started college. It was also my first job ever in my life. I got to work at the factory where Tesla cars are made and see Elon Musk in person. I made a lot of friends, saw a lot of places, ate good (limited) food. I grew a lot that summer.\n\nGoing back to Ames was just sad. It was like coming off from a high and back down to boring, flavorless Ames.\n\nThe one good thing was I moved to a new apartment where I could walk to classes <15 min. I started walking a lot more. I like walking.\n\nEverything was mostly a blur, besides classes and going to the library everyday to do work at the wide screen monitors, my environment was unchanging.\n\nAfter a really fun tokyo trip in winter, and the obligatory return to Malaysia, I came back to the cold and unforgiving weather, still trying to get an internship.\n\nEventually Tesla was the only company who wanted me for the summer, and I went back unwillingly, yet with gratitude that I could go back California.\n\nIt was another unforgettable summer. If the first summer was about being able to experience the bay, the second summer was about interacting with the people itself, and getting first-hand experience of the AI energy in SF. I had my parents with me for 3 weeks and got to drive around and explored with them. I went to church. I made more friends, saw old ones, had my first party experience, first meetups, first in-person hackathon. I remembered why I loved the bay and fell back in love with her again. If there's a place that can instill in you with the belief that anything is possible, it's SF.\n\nGoing back for my one final semester for one class was dreadful. I was actively trying to stay / go back after my 14-week internship was done.\n\nBut I'm glad with how my time here at Ames ended, I'm leaving on a good note. I'm really grateful for the chinese church and the people there who were filled with the love and kindness of God. It reminded me of the good in people, and that I have the responsibility to show it to others as well.\n\nClosing this chapter of my life, I learned a lot, but I still have a lot to learn.\n\nI'm still incredibly sick of living in this body. So, I'm glad I get to go home and fix my body. I'm going to do surgery and get my life back.\n\nAnd I'll be back stronger than ever.\n","data":{"title":"Graduating","tags":"life, journal","date":"Dec 16, 2023"},"filePath":"isu.md"},{"content":"\nToday was the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Fall 2023 Undergraduate Convocation [ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/amFC54Qeykw?si=5C4qdOCNjTfHPe_o).\n\nAll of the graduates received a medallion, with the three words inscribed on it.\n\n<mark>INVENT.

I also got the chance to interview Dale, a super kind and loving church friend.\n- ENGL 150: Critical Thinking and Communication\n  - lots of writing exercises, wrote about failing my driving test, made a poster about DJI FPV and presented it. It was funny reading my writing from 2 years ago. Realize I did achieve some of the goals I set for myself, and never realized I had that drive and attitude back then.\n\n### Summer 2021\n\n- COM S 228: Introduction to Data Structures\n  - the professor was interesting, he would write in a matrix themed text editor as he taught the class. Learned about inheritance and polymorphism, search, linked list, stacks, trees, maps, hashtables and heaps, and graphs.\n\n### Fall 2021\n\nI flew in to ISU in this semester. Felt really free after being trapped in the house for a year.\n\n- STAT 110: Statistics Orientation\n  - I met some friendly people here. We would have weekly compulsory activities and had to take pictures of ourselves meeting up. Never saw them since the class.\n- STAT 301: Intermediate Statistical Concepts And Methods\n  - This class was standard statistics stuff like regression, anova, hypo test, etc. I had to use JMP, a software for boomers to do statistics. I liked making the two page cheatsheets for the exams. I had to work some americans in a team for the project and labs.\n- STAT 342: Introduction To The Theory Of Probability And Statistics II\n  - This class is supposed to be hard, but the professors made it easy in exams? I remember she gave us back the test papers to \"correct our mistake\" to give us more marks. As someone from Malaysia, this was funny, but also made me realize the quality of education here. It had topics like Method of Moments, MLE, bias and unbiased, factorization theorem, MVUE, sufficient statistics. All these heavy stats concepts. I remember this korean dude that always went to me for answers, and would swear in korean under his breath during the exams.\n- COM S 230: Discrete Computational Structures\n  - this is the most theoretical CS class I had to take for my minor. taught by a former MIT undergrad student. It's basically a math course but for cs. I remember getting a pretty low score in my first exam, which scared me into taking this class more seriously. The logic, proofs, sets, counting and graphs were fine, but relations and set cardinality were hard to grasp. The TA, Jonathan is the hard carry in helping my friends and I get through this course. I have major respect for good TAs.\n- ENGL 250: Written, Oral, Visual, And Electronic Composition\n  - my first ever in person english class experience in the US. It was just me and J who were not americans and white and loud. I felt discriminated in this class, maybe it was just in my head, but it was hard to fit in. I went through my assignments and found that I wrote an interview piece with Harry Styles for his Fine Line album lol. The in-class and outdoors activities were a huge struggle to get out of my comfort zone, but it was a good experience nonetheless.\n- U ST 110 International First Year Seminar\n  - This class is basically meeting up once a week for some activities, talks from ISU staff, one time the police came to talk about safety. I got to give a panel talk this year for this class, full circle.\n\n### Spring 2022\n\nI came back from Malaysia and had a really bad flare up where I couldn't swallow food. I had to apply for a medical reduced course load. So I only took these two classes.\n\n- COM S 311: Introduction To The Design And Analysis Of Algorithms\n  - this class was challenging and fun. Taught me how to think like a computer scientist and learned some important concepts in CS: the sorting and searching algorithms, data structures, graphs, and NP-completeness. I remember working on the HWs with my friends at the library, discussing about the solutions together. I was also surprised that I got good grades in my finals, I remember thinking, \"wait, I did well?\"\n- THTRE 110: Theatre and Society\n  - took this class cause it was required. basically just got answers from a friend for the online quizzes.\n\n### Fall 2022\n\nI came back from California and felt pretty depressed. Really disliked Iowa ever since. I missed the highs in the bay area, the friends, and the energy.\n\n- STAT 471: Introduction to Experimental Design\n  - this class is interesting and relates to experimentation in tech, but it was hard to relate the concepts and fully comprehend them. I felt like I was just getting by. Concepts like subsampling, variance components, interaction, factorial treatment, split plots, blocking. It all felt really agriculture-centric. I wish a CS professor taught me this class.\n- STAT 475: Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis\n  - The chinese professor teaching this class was literally just reading the slides. I could see his inexperience in teaching. I stopped going classes after two weeks. The exams were open book. I remember listening to music on my airpods while taking the test lol.\n- STAT 484: Computer Processing of Scientific Data\n  - I had to learn SAS in this class. A SQL-like and boring language that I'll never have to use ever in my life. Just use Python guys.\n- ENGL 314: Technical Communication\n  - This class is a joke, I got a B+. I wrote a technical document about air fryers and how to make a fruit fly trap. If only ChatGPT came out during this time.\n\n### Spring 2023\n\nI went to Tokyo and then Malaysia, and came back in the cold and depressing land of corn. At this point, I really wanted to get done. I was applying for internships since the previous semester, and wasn't getting anything at all.\n\n- STAT 486: Introduction To Statistical Computing\n  - my research professor taught this class, it's weird to take a class with someone you work with, especially when he knows you skip his class, and says things like \"if you came to my class you would know X or Y\"\n- STAT 474: Introduction To Bayesian Data Analysis\n  - This is the hardest statistics class I took at my time here. I thought it would be fun and interesting, but oh boy was I wrong. I got the lowest in a class of 11 of other grad students in the first exam, and overall a B+. Maybe it was because I barely studied or reviewed the materials, but I felt pretty dumb in this class, like there's a concept that I just couldn't hold in my hands, it kept slipping away like sand. Maybe I had to concentrate my efforts more, be more curious, and hard working.\n- S E 419: Software Tools For Large Scale Data Analysis\n  - took this class for fun because it kinda relates to data engineering, but it taught pretty old stuff, and never liked the professors classes, so I lost interest really quick. I only went to the required labs, which forced me to borrow a windows for school to do the assignments.\n- COM S 472: Principles Of Artificial Intelligence\n  - I had fun with the [programming exercises](https://github.com/benthecoder/othello-ai). Never went to class after the first 2 weeks. studying for midterms and finals just involved 2x speed a few days before, and taking notes on notion.\n\n### Fall 2023\n\nI left this one final class so I could graduate with my sister. Initially I felt like it was bad planning, I could've just graduated in May and went full time at Tesla, but this entire semester was chill and I got to experience things I never did before and do things I enjoy, which I'm grateful about.\n\n- STAT 483: Empirical Methods For The Computational Sciences\n  - This was my last statistics class and I just completely lost interest in statistics. The professor (Kris De Brabanter) was actually nice and enthusiastic, but with the things I went through during this semester, it was just a means to an end. His exams were open notes and easy, so I'm thankful for that.\n\nOverall, was a statistics degree worth it? Am I now a statistician? Do I have more statistics knowledge than an average person? I am not sure. I read through some of the lectures and exams and a lot of those concepts seem remote to me. I couldn't even recognize my own homeworks.\n\nMaybe majoring in software engineering/CS could've given me a better transition into a CS grad degree, and I could've hung out with my friends more in their classes, but hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nI can only move forward, and focus on going into the next stage of my life.\n","data":{"title":"ISU classes: A Review","tags":"life","date":"Dec 14, 2023"},"filePath":"isuclasses.md"},{"content":"\nI'm graduating with a Statistics bachelor's degree but felt like I don't really understand anything about statistics yet.\n\nI asked my research professor, Dr J. about what I should takeaway from my degree.\n\nThis is his response.\n\nInference\n\n- Random sample (sample -> prediction)\n- Random assignment of treatment allows claims of causality\n\nUncertainty\n\n- data are random\n- belief and frequency interpretation for probability\n- expectation vs prediction\n  - confidence interval for mu (E[y])\n  - prediction interval for y tilde\n","data":{"title":"What all Statisticians Should Know","tags":"statistics","date":"Dec 13, 2023"},"filePath":"statistics.md"},{"content":"\n![Melancholy (c. 1892) by Edvard Munch](/images/melancholy.jpg)\n\nA definition of intelligence that a lot of psychologists [agree](https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/a0026699) on is:\n\n> Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do […] Intelligence, so defined, can be measured, and intelligence tests measure it well.\n\nDoesn't intelligence sound great? Isn't \"catching on\" and \"making sense\", and \"figuring out\" all what life is about?\n\nSo intelligent people must live happier lives.\n\nIf they encounter a problem, they can use their superior problem-solving ability to solve them. They should do better jobs at making plans, getting what they want, and learn from their mistakes and make fewer of them.\n\nSo [are smarter people happier](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/why-arent-smart-people-happier?curius=1417)?\n\n[Many](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264815376_Does_Intelligence_Boost_Happiness_Smartness_of_All_Pays_More_Than_Being_Smarter_Than_Others) [studies](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1998-deneve.pdf) [find](https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/s0033291712002139) that either it's no, or only a little bit.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nGenerally, IQ can predict things like how well you do in school and what kind of job you get, but why can't it predict living a life you like?\n\nAll various tests of intelligence are well-defined problems. They can be difficult but they aren't mystical. You can write instructions for solving them, and have indisputable answers.\n\nBut well-defined problems aren't the only kind of problems.\n\n\"Should I go into tech or arts?\", \"Who do I spend my life with\" and \"What do I do when my parents get old\" are not multiple choices questions. These are all important but poorly defined problems.\n\nThere is no good word for the \"skill at solving poorly defined problems\".\n\nInsight, creativity, agency, self-knowledge are all part of it, but not all of it.\n\nWisdom comes closest but it suggest a certain grandeur, and it's not all about asking \"how do you live a good life\". There's also \"how do I figure out what to do today\" and \"how to be a good friend\".\n\nTo spot people who are good at solving poorly defined problems, look for people who feel good about their lives.\n\nBut it's not black and white. What makes me happy might make you miserable. What made you happy in 20s might not make you happy in your 30s.\n\nLife isn't chess, and no one agrees on the rules. The pieces do whatever they want and the board covers the inside of your head and the whole globe.\n\nSome of the smartest people in the world can be endowed with exceptional problem-solving abilities, yet they are unable to solve basic but poorly defined problems like being a good person and not making life-altering mistakes.\n\nIt's time to divide intelligence into well-defined problem-solving and poorly defined problem-solving.\n\nIt shows us that all of AI's progress has only been on defined problems.\n\nIt also reminds us to give respect where respect is due.\n\nPeople who are good at solving well-defined problems are called \"professors\" and \"doctors\" and get paid money and praise. But people good at solving poorly defined problems don't get the same kind of treatment.\n\nYour parents, grandparents, and people who's been on this Earth for decades longer than you know how to raise a good family who love one another, how to carry on through hardships and tragedies, and how to make good food.\n\nIf you don't value their ability in solving poorly defined problems, you'll never get more of it.\n\nYou won't seek out the people who have this ability and try to learn from them, nor will you listen to them when they have something important to say.\n\nYou'll spend your life trying to use intelligence when what you need is wisdom.\n\nYou'll realize that your endless efforts in trying to solve all the well-defined problems will not actually make your life better.\n\nSo listen to your parents for a while and you'll learn something.\n","data":{"title":"Smart != Happier","tags":"intelligence, ideas","date":"Dec 12, 2023"},"filePath":"smart-happy.md"},{"content":"\nWhen you grew up, did you play freely on the street?\n\nThe people who learned to play on the street learned social negotiation.

It isn’t just anything about a person or scene that’s at stake; we want to remember what really matters, and the people we call good artists are, in part, the ones who appear to have made the right choices about what to communicate and what to leave out\"\n   - \"Art is a way of preserving experiences, of which there are many transient and beautiful examples, and that we need help containing\"\n2. **Hope**\n   - Optimism is a necessary cognitive and psychoemotional skill in our quest to live well.\n   - \"in many cases the difference between success and failure is determined by nothing more than our sense of what is possible and the energy we can muster to convince others of our due. We might be doomed not by a lack of skill, but by an absence of hope\"\n   - \"The more difficult our lives, the more a graceful depiction of a flower might move us. The tears — if they come — are in response not to how sad the image is, but how pretty.\"\n3. **Sorrow**\n   - Art can help us be more whole by not only expanding our capacity for positive emotions, but also fully inhabit and metabolize the negative\n   - \"We can see a great deal of artistic achievement as “sublimated” sorrow on the part of the artist, and in turn, in its reception, on the part of the audience.\"\n   - \"In art, sublimation refers to the psychological processes of transformation, in which base and unimpressive experiences are converted into something noble and fine — exactly what may happen when sorrow meets art\"\n4. **Rebalancing**\n   - we all have imbalances: too complacent, too trusting, too serious, and art can help restore a measure of equilibrium to our inner selves. And it explains the vast diversity of our aesthetic preferences\n   - \"Every work of art is imbued with a particular psychological and moral atmosphere: ... our preferences for one kind over another reflect our varied psychological gaps. We hunger for artworks that will compensate for our inner fragilities and help return us to a viable mean.\"\n   - \"Art can save us time — and save our lives — through opportune and visceral reminders of balance and goodness that we should never presume we know enough about already.\"\n5. **Self-understanding**\n   - despite trying to be self-aware, we are complete mysteries to ourselves, and art can shed light on the least explored parts of our psyche\n   - \"We have intuitions, suspicions, hunches, vague musings, and strangely mixed emotions, all of which resist simple definition. We have moods, but we don’t really know them. Then, from time to time, we encounter works of art that seem to latch on to something we have felt but never recognized clearly before\"\n   - \"a central function of poetry as taking thoughts we experience half-formed and giving them clear expression\"\n6. **Growth**\n   - art expands the boundaries of who we are by helping us overcome the fear of the unfamiliar and live more richly by inviting the unknown\n   - art presents us with \"alien material that provokes defensive boredom and fear, and allows us time and privacy to learn to deal more strategically with it\"\n   - First, acknowledge the strangeness for art that comes with worldviews radically different and contradictory. Second, make ourselves familiar with the minds who created the alien art. Finally, look for points of connections and relate to the personal reality of your own context.\n7. **Appreciation**\n   - habit is a double-edged sword that steals from us a whole range of experiences as we go into autopilot mode. We fail to take note of what is around us, and instead, yearn for some artificial greatness.\n   - Jasper Johns, 'Painted Bronze' (1960) teaches us to look with kinder and more alert eyes at the mundane and familiar.\n   - \"Art can do the opposite of glamorizing the unattainable; it can reawaken us to the genuine merit of life as we’re forced to lead it.\"\n","data":{"title":"Art as Therapy","tags":"art","date":"Dec 10, 2023"},"filePath":"art-therapy.md"},{"content":"\n![Veronese Room, Gardner Museum](/images/veronese.jpeg)\n\nTaste used to be reserved for conversations around fashion and art, but now we look for it in people, in technology, and in ourselves.\n\nYou have an intuitive sense of people in your life with great taste. They're the ones who you go to for recommendations for movies, restaurants, tech, etc. Or the extra set of eyes to check on your work before you release it to the public.\n\nThe quintessential example of someone with good taste is Isabella Stewart Gardner. She has a [collection](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/experience/collection) of 7500 paintings, sculptures, furniture, textiles, silver, ceramics, 3000 rare books, and 7000 archival objects-from ancient Rome, Medieval Europe, Renaissance Italy, Asia, the Islamic world and 19th-century France and America.\n\nIf you were asked to define taste, what would you say?\n\nSomething along the lines of \"you know it when you see it\" or \"it's in the eye of the beholder\"?\n\nIt's hard to pin down, because they describe a [sensibility](https://newcriterion.com/issues/1998/2/the-new-sensibility) more than any particular quality, a particular thing.\n\nIt's an ability or sensitivity to appreciate and respond to aesthetic influences.\n\nSome notes on \"taste\" on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/blog/notes-on-taste).\n\n- Taste is a mode, it's a manner of interpretation, expression or action.\n  - Things don't feel tasteful, they demonstrate taste. (i.e. you can dress tastefully but an experience cannot be tasteful)\n- **appreciation and creation** are forms of taste, but they don't have to be intertwined.\n  - You can have impeccable taste in art without producing any, but those who create tasteful things are almost always deep appreciators.\n  - creating forces taste upon it's maker, they must master self-expression and craft to make something truly compelling\n- we talk about taste in binaries, either you have it or not. great taste means almost the same as taste\n- Having taste requires intention, focus, and care. It's a commitment to a state of attention, you can't have taste by mistake\n- Taste comes in lanes: there is taste in people, visual, emotion, acts, and intelligence (taste in ideas). Taste tends to develop unevenly.\n- Taste is often formed through the integration of diverse, wide-ranging inputs.\n  - Steve Jobs said, \"I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.\"\n- John Folley: \"Good taste is simply to have a well formed opinion, in accordance to the realities of the Good and the True\". There are tasteful and non-tasteful choices.\n- Taste is not the same as correctness. Taste intrigues, compels, moves, enchants, fascinates, and seduces.\n- Taste requires originality, it invokes aspirational authenticity (i.e. writing stories that only ou can write, to be joyfully and defiantly yourself)\n- Taste honors someone's standard of quality, but also the distinctive way the world bounces off a person. It reflects what they know about how the world works, and what they're working with in their inner worlds.\n- By turning the chaotic and overwhelming pool of information into a steady stream of things we find beautiful, we can define and cultivate our tastes.\n- There are no shortcuts to taste. Take your time learning what you find compelling, and why.\n- Susan Sontag: “taste has no system and no proofs. But there is something like a logic of taste: the consistent sensibility which underlies and gives rise to a certain taste\n","data":{"title":"What is \"taste\"","tags":"ideas","date":"Dec 9, 2023"},"filePath":"taste.md"},{"content":"\n![The Water-Lily Pond](/images/bridge.jpg)\n\n[The marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/) has beautiful and poetic writing about philosophy and life.\n\nShe wrote about [16 life-learnings](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/23/16-learnings/) from 16 years of writing the newsletter.\n\n1.

In each event, I would meet new people, practice my social skills, and get inspired by the speakers and other attendees. I remember it feeling surreal how all these people who I read about on the internet, were in the same room as me.\n\nAs someone who's organized events (on a smaller scale), it's interesting to be on the other side. You see all the work that have to go into it, the logistics and the planning.\n\nIn ISU, I started [GDSC](https://gdsc.community.dev/iowa-state-university/) to build a community of developers who wanted to learn from each other. It was challenging finding people who shared the same passion as me. Maybe it has something to do with me being in Iowa. Also, starting a new club was difficult considering it took an entire semester to get it approved, and having Google's name in the club confuses but also attracts people.\n\nSome lessons I've learned organizing events for students:\n\n- be able to introduce your club in 30 seconds, it should clearly define why you're different from existing clubs\n- organize a wide variety of events, people will show up\n- for every event, think about what the students can takeaway from\n- good design and branding is important, especially since we're representing Google\n- utilize professors to reach out to students\n- the date and time matters, don't clash with other big events\n- have a list of event ideas ready to go\n- reach out to speakers on twitter, linkedin, people are willing to talk\n- create a event checklist to reuse, to streamline tasks for everyone\n\nDave has a lot more experience, 5 years of running a tech meetup.\n\nHere's his [12 lessons](https://davekiss.com/blog/12-lessons-from-5-years-of-running-a-tech-meetup):\n\n1. The **space** where you host matters: great lighting, noise level, comfy seating\n2. <mark>You're selling an experience that doesn't exist yet</mark>: Posters and graphics should paint a picture of the event, show pictures of prior events\n3. **Over-communicate** the event logistics and agenda: you can't provide too much information, create a description template for events, and slideshow for intro\n4. Seek out the most **interesting stories**: Find people who will make you excited to attend the event yourself\n5. Find reliable, recurring **sponsors**: find tech companies, negotiate a longer term slot (3-event package), communicate back summary of how event went, anything to help justify their spend, find companies willing to rent space for free\n6. Order **less food** than you think you need: 30% dropoff for all RSVPs, cover 80% of predicted attendance\n7. Leave blocks of **social time**: the real value of meetups, leave time before and after\n8. Two attendees is a meetup: all it takes is another person to show up besides you\n9. Ask for feedback, reviews, and **testimonials**: social proof helps, be explicit and ask for feedback, quote testimonials\n10. Keep the **momentum** going: tease future events, send reminder emails, have events planned months out\n11. **Know your reasons** for organizing a meetup: it can turn into work really fast, so focus on the people, the stories and experiences you want to create\n12.

It is contrasted with [learned helplessness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326).\n\n### 3 components of optimism\n\n1. Permanence: is this bad thing forever?\n   - pessimist: this will never end\n   - optimist: this is temporary, it will pass\n2. Pervasiveness: is this problem global?\n   - pessimist: this is the worst, my life is over\n   - optimist: not everything is bad, finds silver lining\n3. Personalization: is this problem personal?\n   - pessimist: it's all me, I'll never be good enough\n   - optimist: this isn't my fault, I can't control everything\n\n### Why optimism is good\n\nThere are many [benefits](https://positivepsychology.com/learned-optimism/#research) to optimism.\n\n- lower heart problems\n- live longer\n- more motivated and successful\n- more effective at decision making\n- higher rates of well being and lower rates of depression\n\nThe opposite of optimism is depression, the cognitive triad of depression is negative thoughts about **yourself**, **other people**, and the **future**.\n\nDepression causes pessimistic thinking, and you feel like this is just how the world is. You feel like you can't change anything, and you're stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. This is depression talking, it's not reality.\n\n### How to be more optimistic\n\nTHe ABCDE technique.\n\n- A: **Adversity** (the stressful situation)\n  - Being diagnosed with a chronic illness.\n- B: **Belief** (what you think about it)\n  - \"This illness will ruin my life. I won't be able to do things I love.\"\n- C: **Consequence** (what happens as a result of your belief)\n  - Feeling hopeless and depressed\n  - withdrawing from social activities\n  - rejecting treatment and support\n- D: **Dispute** (challenge your pessimism)\n  - Recognize that the illness is a challenge, not an end to everything enjoyable.\n  - Understand that many people live fulfilling lives despite chronic illnesses.\n  - Reflect on past challenges overcome successfully.\n  - Replace the belief with \"This illness is a part of my life, but it doesn't define me.\"\n- E: **Energization** (how it energizes you)\n  - Feeling empowered to explore treatment options.\n  - Engaging in activities adapted to new limitations.\n  - Seeking support from healthcare professionals, friends, and support groups.\n  - Focusing on what can be done rather than limitations.\n\n### Toxic positivity\n\nToxic positivity is denying or ignoring negative aspect sof life.\n\nHealthy optimism acknowledges the negative, but chooses to focus on the potential positive and opportunities for growth.\n","data":{"title":"Optimism","tags":"psychology","date":"Dec 6, 2023"},"filePath":"optimism.md"},{"content":"\nA good first step when building a thing is to build a thing that [does nothing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230725-00/?p=108482).\n\nThis way, you know you're starting from a good place.\n\nIf you're building a component, [Raymond Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/author/oldnewthing) suggests to do it in these steps:\n\n- Step 0: Develop a standalone program to perform the action, conforming the action is possible\n- Step 1: Create a basic structure (class or module) without full functionality\n- Step 2: Add method to test operational context with simple output\n- Step 3: Prepare method/function for action with parameters, but without execution\n- Step 4: Integrate core functionality from step 0 for full operation\n\nHe comments that inexperienced devs dive in and start writing a big complex thing, and can't even get it to compile.\n\nSo start with something that does nothing.

The First Pass: What's the idea? (5-10 mins)\n\nThis quick scan helps to get a general understanding of the paper and decide if further reading is necessary. It involves:\n\n- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.\n- Read section and sub-section headings, ignore everything else\n- Read the conclusions\n- Glance over the references\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should identify five Cs:\n\n1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?\n2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?\n3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?\n4. Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?\n5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?\n\n### 2. The Second Pass: Grasps the content (~ 1 hour)\n\nIn this stage, read the paper more carefully but skip over details like proofs:\n\n- Examine figures and diagrams closely. Pay special attentions to graphs\n- Take notes and mark important references for future reading.\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should be able to:\n\n- grasp content of paper\n- summarize main thrust of paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else\n\nIf you don't understand it, either it is a new subject matter, an experimental technique, or it's poorly written\n\n### 3. The Third Pass: Go in depth, re-implement (4-5 hours)\n\nThis is an in-depth reading where you try to understand the paper at a deeper level and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- implement the paper: make the same assumptions as the authors and re-create the work\n- identify and challenge every assumption in every statement\n- compare yours and the actual paper, identify the paper's innovation and hidden failings and assumptions.\n- jot down ideas for future work\n\nBy the end of this pass, you should be able to:\n\n- reconstruct the entire structure of paper from memory\n- Identify its strong and weak points\n- pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with the techniques\n\n### Guidelines for reading\n\n- Read critically\n  - don't assume authors are always correct, ask appropriate questions\n- Read creatively\n  - what are the good ideas in this paper?\n  - Do the ideas have other applications or extensions?\n  - are there possible improvements\n  - what would be the next thing you would do?\n  - Do one pass on each paper\n- Make notes as you read\n\n### Doing a Literature Survey\n\nWhen conducting a literature survey, the three-pass approach is valuable:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Use academic search engines with specific keywords to find initial papers and read their related work sections.\n2. **Identifying Key Papers**: Look for shared citations and author names in these papers to find key research in the area.\n3. **Exploring Conference Proceedings**: Visit top conference websites in the field and browse their proceedings for recent high-quality work.\n\nThrough this method, you can efficiently conduct a literature survey by identifying and understanding the most relevant papers in a field.\n","data":{"title":"How to Read Papers","tags":"ideas","date":"Nov 29, 2023"},"filePath":"readpaper.md"},{"content":"\nThings to [remind ourselves](https://changelog.com/posts/things-we-always-remind-ourselves-while-coding) while coding.\n\nI should have this printed out and put on my wall.\n\n### On health & wellness\n\n- Exercise\n- Take a break (7x)\n- Don’t burn out\n- Make sure to eat\n- Your body position\n\n### Pep talk & self-encouragement\n\n- I can do this\n- It’s ok to fail\n- You can do it\n- You’ll figure it out\n- The solution is probably simple\n- Everyone has the same struggles\n- There’s got to be a way to do this\n- I’m not stupid—this just takes time\n- There IS a solution, just have to find it\n- Writing failing code is not a personality trait\n- It’s going to be difficult before it gets easier\n\n### Following best practices\n\n- Keep it simple (8x)\n- Verify, don’t trust\n- Don’t DRY too soon\n- Add sensible comments\n- Good commit messages\n- Simple is better than smart\n- Don’t forget to do that side refactor\n\n### Focus\n\n- Not to drift off\n- Don’t surf the web\n- One thing at a time\n- Read docs properly\n- What am I working on?\n- Read the documentation\n- Read (and reread) the error message\n- Finish committing before pushing (seriously)\n- You don’t have time to try that new thing out\n- (distracted) What was I supposed to be doing?\n- Don’t spend an hour on tiny things that don’t matter\n\n### Slowing down vs going faster\n\n- Slow down\n- Ship sooner\n- Optimize it later\n- It’s good enough\n- Stop overthinking it\n- Don’t over-optimize\n- Don’t over-engineer\n- Slow down and think\n- Just get something working\n- Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good\n- There’s no single perfect solution, there are always drawbacks\n- Better to get something out than sitting analyzing the problem\n","data":{"title":"Coding Reminders","tags":"programming","date":"Nov 28, 2023"},"filePath":"reminders-coding.md"},{"content":"\n[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), the GOAT who gifted us the [Neural Networks from Zero To Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) videos, released a 1hr [Intro to LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) video ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxx_ZI7O-Nwl7ZLNk5hI3WzAsTLwvNU7/view))\n\nBelow are my takeaways.\n\n- LLMs are neutal networks with billions of parameters dispersed through them, we know how to iteratively adjust the parameters to make them better, but we don't know how they collaborate to do it\n- training LLMs = lossy compression (100x compression ratio), there is [close relationship](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/the-intricate-link-between-compression) between compression and performance\n- hallucinations: LLMs dreams, think of them as mostly inscrutable artifacts, develop correspondingly sophisticated evaluations\n- how LLMs are build\n  - 1\\) pre-training for knowledge\n    - get large amounts of text (~10 TB), and get expensive compute (~6000 GPUs)\n    - compress text into neural network (pay ~$2m and wait ~12 days)\n    - get a **base model**\n  - 2\\) fine-tuning for alignment\n    - write labelling instructions\n    - hire people (scale.ai) to collect 100k high quality ideal Q&A instructions or comparisons\n    - finetune base model on this data (wait ~1 day)\n    - obtain **assistant model**\n    - run lots of evaluations\n    - deploy\n    - monitor, collect misbehaviours, go back to step 1\n  - 3\\) RLHF with comparisons data, train model on good/bad outputs\n- scaling laws:\n  - performance of LLMs is a smooth, well-behaved, predictable function of\n    - N: no. of parameters in network\n    - D: amount of text\n  - expect a lot of \"general capability\" across all areas of knowledge\n- system 2 thinking\n  - LLMs currently only have system 1 fast thinking, just next word prediction\n  - the goal is system 2, where they take time to think through a problem, providing more accurate answers\n  - how? create tree of thought and reflect on question before answering\n- self-improvement\n  -

It felt like I got invited to a wealthy person's house to explore in their library. It's cozy and inviting, and overall I felt good being in there. If I lived in Boston, I would come here everyday if I had the chance.\n\nIt was time for dim sum, we walked through Boston Common, and got to Winsor Dim Sum Cafe.\n\nThis spot was great. The food came fast. The dim sum was good. What more can you ask?\n\nTt was time for the two popular museums.\n\nWe took the subway and I saw Northeaster University through the window.\n\nI wanted to go to [Isabella Stewart Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner?useskin=vector) Museum for the really aesthetic garden, but I ended up really liking the artworks. There were 3 floors and multiple rooms, each telling their own story about Isabella's [life](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/about/isabella-stewart-gardner).\n\nI got tired after going through all the rooms and me and A decided to sketch. I sat down and saw a couple sitting in front of me on their phones with the garden in the background. I have trouble drawing hands. Sketching is pretty fun.\n\nWe went to Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) next. The funny thing is when we found out tickets were 27, we were like nope. And wanted to get out of line, but ended up already getting in the Museum. So we decided to just look around, and the deeper we went the more guilt A felt. As my guilty conscience began to grow as well, after seeing the Monet paintings, I only wanted to see Hokusai and leave. But it was such a huge museum, that navigating to the Asian art section took 20 minutes. And when I did find it, it was \"Coming soon\". We left to the gift store and I bought some items with the Great Wave on them.\n\nLeaving MFA, it was already night.\n\nWe walked to Berklee College of Music, but entry was only for students.\n\nWe went to Prudential center next. We explored around Eataly, I bought some italian chocolates.\n\nThere was nothing else to see there, so we went for the public library, but it was closed.\n\nWe rested at the Capital One Cafe, and decided to go Chinatown for claypot. But on the way there, an all-you-can-eat sushi place caught A's attention. We decided to eat here instead. I love Eel sushi. The tofu was also super silky and smooth. Edamame is crunchy. We had a good time. I notice again how we're quiet and other tables are really loud, especially the groups with all guys. A observed that waiters/waitresses in Boston are not very friendly.\n\nWe walked home from the Japanese restaurant.\n\nWe finished Identity, watched an explainer video on YouTube, then an episode of Naruto to end our day on a lighter tone.\n\nMy eyes were burning.\n\nWe slept at 1:24 a.m.\n","data":{"title":"Boston Day 3: Isabella & MFA","tags":"travel, journal","date":"Nov 22 2023"},"filePath":"boston-d3.md"},{"content":"\n![mit](/images/mit.jpeg)\n\nI woke up too early, I always wake up early when I'm sleeping in hotels.\n\nToday we're visiting both Harvard and MIT.\n\nFor anyone who plans to visit both in one day, here was our plan that maximizes the places you can explore.\n\n### Harvard\n\nArrive the museum at 9 a.m.\n\n1. Harvard Museum of Natural History ($10 for students, takes an hour min)\n   1. Harvard Museum of Ancient Near East (close by, 3 floors of Eastern civilization artifacts)\n2. Science center (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments)\n3. Memorial Hall\n4. Gund hall (Druker Design Gallery)\n5. John Harvard Statue\n6. Widener Library (Harvard ID required)\n7. Harvard Art Museum (Free admission, an hour min as well)\n8. Harvard Square\n9. Harvard book store\n\nGet lunch nearby, we went to Hokkaido Ramen. I'd give it a 8/10, +1 because it was a cold day and the broth warmed us up.\n\n### MIT\n\nGet here around 3 p.m.\n\n1. Great Dome (grab a picture here)\n2. Stata Center\n3. MIT Science Museum (closes at 5, so get here around 3:15?)\n\nAfter the museum, you can cross the Harvard Bridge to Newbury Street for shopping and dinner.\n\n### Newbury Street\n\nSome places we went\n\n- UNIQLO\n- Muji\n- TJ Maxx.\n- Anime Zakka\n- Trident Booksellers & Cafe\n- DeLuca's Market\n\n### Some thoughts\n\nOverall, I found Harvard a more interesting place to explore than MIT, it might have something to do with us getting to MIT Great Dome at 4:20 p.m., and we were losing daylight, and we didn't get to go to the museum which closes at 5 p.m. I was blamed by A for spending too much time at the bookstore.\n\nThe Natural History museum was fun, it had glass flowers, pretty rocks, lifelike mammals around the world, insects, birds, fossils, and more. Connected to it was the Peabody Museum of Archeology & Ethnology, one of the world's oldest anthropology museum. You could see Maya monuments, artifacts by Native American communities, objects traded by 18th century Boston ship captains.\n\nThe Art museum was really nice as well, although we spent ~45 min speedrunning the place because we wanted to be on time for MIT. Maybe that's not such a good strategy for museums, instead of maximizing your surface area, and catching an eye of every painting and artwork, you're supposed to slow down, observe it from all angles, notice what feelings geyser up from inside you, whether positive or negative, or just enjoy the work of artists who poured their heart and soul, taking the leap to pursue their artistic passion, materializing their past experiences, their innovative, unconventional ideas, into something physical, something visceral.\n\nThe Harvard book store, specifically the used section below ground, was kind of a let down, I didn't find any good books there. The new books were expensive and well, new. I'm feel strongly against buying new books nowadays, it feels weird. I'd rather buy a book that someone else used to leave at their coffee table to show off to their guests that they're book readers, folded in their hands burning under the sun while they read in the balcony, or books that sat in someone's shelf collecting dusts until the owners decided that it could be in better hands.\n\nThe Great dome was cool, I never knew what was inside, and now I do. It was classrooms, research labs, lecture halls, study spaces, etc. The interesting thing about MIT that A observed is all the buildings are connected really well. You could possible get from class to your dorm barely even stepping foot outside.\n\nNewbury street is a great way to end the day. There are tons of shops and food places here.

We were so confused.\n\nWe left after warming up and settling in, and went for Quincy Market.\n\nI had high expectations for this place to be super crowded and Christmasy for some reason, but it was just a indoor marketplace with food and desserts, and then some shops outside. The entire area was pretty dead.\n\nWe were cold and disappointed, and went back to Chinatown.\n\nWe walked around and came across Hong Kong eatery, which was on our list.\n\nWe went in and ordered some takeaway. Some were standing and others were sitting at the small tables and chairs, with Jay Chou was playing on the small tv on the wall. The restaurant was small but cozy.\n\nI got fish porridge, which reminded me of Malaysia.\n\nWhile waiting for our orders, we went around the multitudes of bakeries around, all selling similar pastries, mooncakes, and buns but with their own unique touch and branding.\n\nI saw so many chinese people while walking around and exploring. Always nice to be surrounded by people like you, makes it feel like I'm home.\n\nWe took our order and walked back to our airbnb.\n\nAte the food and talked about our day.\n\nPlanned the spots to hit in Harvard and MIT the next day.\n\nWatched a bit of the movie Identity cause it just came up in our conversations.\n\nSlept at 12 and looked forward to the exciting day in store of us.\n","data":{"title":"Boston Day 1: Quincy Market","tags":"travel, journal","date":"Nov 20, 2023"},"filePath":"boston-d1.md"},{"content":"\nTech companies are [increasingly](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247794) choosing to hire PhD students in Economics.\n\nI read an [article](https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8) about the Economics Team at Instacart, and here are my takeaways.\n\n### Projects they worked on\n\nThe economists at Instacart, part of their Econ Team, work on a variety of challenging projects that blend economics with machine learning.\n\n1. **Optimized Bidding for Ad Auctions:**\n   -

Anchor content\n   - add liveliness with subtle animation (water rippling and clouds)\n   - create atmosphere with spatial audio\n   - avoid large fast movements, fade out content when moving, and back in when settled\n   - provide clear entry and exit to immersive experience with recognizable icons like expand/collapse arrows\n5. **Authentic**\n   - Identify key interactions, perspectives or moments that can be experienced spatially (ex: viewing panorama, seeing pictures at real-life scale) with rich visuals and high-fidelity audio, make things feel real.\n   - Make use of space and immersion for creativity, focus, or evoking feelings\n\nThe video shows a lot of cool examples for these concepts.\n\nI can't wait for the day where I own a [Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), and interact with the web in a completely different way.\n","data":{"title":"5 Principles of Spatial Design","tags":"design","date":"Nov 16, 2023"},"filePath":"spatial.md"},{"content":"\nI took a [Linear Algebra](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linear_algebra) (LA) class in my first year of college, it was taught in such a mathematical and algebraic way that I couldn't appreciate it at all.\n\nI got a B+ in that class, I remember in the the final exam I didn't have time to finish the test and got mad at myself, and then disappointed. I also realize I don't understand Linear Algebra at all. Like why does the no. of cols in A have to match the no. of rows in B for a [matmul](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Matrix_multiplication) operation?\n\nNow that I'm starting grad school, and have the goal of becoming an AI engineer, it's time to **really** understand LA.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZeDTwWcnuY&t=19s) today taught by the amazing [Charles Frye](https://charlesfrye.github.io/about/), who was also involved in teaching [FSDL](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/).\n\nHe also made videos for calculus and probability in his series [Math4ML](http://wandb.me/m4ml-videos), along with [exercise notebooks](https://github.com/wandb/edu/tree/main/math-for-ml).\n\nHis [analogy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kqf3cq2lvJ8QtunduVtaTCVfFUq574faOC-Sx6yQEK8/edit#slide=id.g7270120a71_1_214) of comparing linear algebra with programming really helped me make sense of the how and the why behind it.\n\nHere are some takeaways.\n\n- LA is like programming\n  - in programming, we combine **functions** with matching **types** through **function composition**\n  - in LA, we combine **matrices** with matching **shapes** through **matrix multiplication**\n  - so, think of matrices as functions, and matmul as a function application, that takes another matrix\n- why arrays as functions?\n  - easy to change slightly, small changes to entries -> small changes to function\n  - LA can be made lightning fast ([TPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit), [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprogramsr))\n  - arrays represent [linear functions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linear_function)\n  - linear functions play nice with weighted sums\n  - this makes linear function easy to reason about\n    - ex: 0 is **always** sent to 0\n    - **everything sent to 0** is called the **[kernel](https://brilliant.org/wiki/kernel/)**\n      - kernel is made of weighted sums\n    - weighted sums define the [rank](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-rank.html) of function\n      - We can make **new non-kernel elements** by making **weighted sums of known non-kernel elements**.\n      - Rank answers the question: **how many non-kernel elements** do I need to know in order to **make every element that’s not in the kernel**?\n- [SVD](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Singular_value_decomposition) is matrix \"refactoring\"\n  - \"separation of concern\" = Eigenvectors (\"eigendecomposition\")\n  - removing redundant code = Low-rank decomposition\n  - break up into functions (decomposing) = Singular Value decomposition (SVD)\n- Function & Matrix decomposition\n  - any function can be decomposed to \"**representatives**\", reversible **renaming**, and **type conversion**\n  - any matrix can be decomposed into A (tall matrix), B (square matrix), C (wide matrix)\n  - in SVD, special choices are made: B is diagonal, and A and C are unitary (no growing/shrinking)\n- why do SVD?\n  - calculate low-rank approximation\n  - used in PCa for preprocessing and analyzing data\n  - classify and measure matrices in LA\n- applied to video\n  - many matrices are nearly low rank (you can notice patterns)\n    - full rank = absence of patterns in matrix\n  - simplest low-rank pattern in a video is the background\n    - an outer product of a vector \\* rest of vectors (a repeat() function)\n    - think of it as an approximation\n    - used to compress data (this is used in JPEG encoding of images in form of Fourier transform)\n    - can be used to separate out foreground. Rank 1 approx is the background, and you can use it to approx foreground.\n\n### LA concepts\n\n- matrix: a function that transforms data\n- matmul: applying a function to an input\n- rank: count of unique, independent features in data\n  - low rank : repeating patterns, useful for compressing data\n  - full rank: implies complex data\n- kernel: a function that returns zero for specific inputs, helps identify redundant or dependent features in data\n- eigenvectors: directions in which data varies the most\n- SVD: decompose function into simpler parts\n  - Surjective (onto): Every possible output is represented.\n  - Bijective (one-to-one and onto): Each input has a unique output and vice versa.\n  - Injective (one-to-one): Every input leads to a unique output.\n\n### More Resources\n\nHackers approach\n\n- [Computational Linear Algebra for Coders](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra)\n- [Introduction to Linear Algebra for Applied Machine Learning with Python](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)\n\nVisualize\n\n- [Graphical Linear Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/04/23/makelele-and-linear-algebra/) – a new way of doing LA\n- [Essence of linear algebra by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) – amazing animations, visualize concepts\n\nPapers/Courses/Textbooks\n\n- [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdf)\n- [Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning | Mathematics | MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)\n- [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-41026-0.pdf)\n","data":{"title":"Linear Algebra for ML","tags":"math, ML","date":"Nov 15, 2023"},"filePath":"linalg.md"},{"content":"\nSome notes from reading a book about design in the design reading room at the design building.\n\nThe word [idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea?useskin=vector) comes from a Greek term meaning \"I saw\", which picks up on the concept that an idea is **an image formed in the mind**.\n\n[Creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity?useskin=vector) is best described as a mental process involving the generation of new ideas and concepts, and this process can be broken down into two pathways: [convergent and divergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking?useskin=vector#Convergent_vs._divergent_thinking).\n\nIt is believed that scientists and engineers display convergent thinking while resolving a problem; which is the deductive generation of the **best single answer to the problem**.\n\nWhereas artists and performers display divergent thinking; the **creative generation** of **multiple answers to a problem**.\n\nDivergent thinking can be utilized as basis for creative brainstorming.\n\nFour basic [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming?useskin=vector#Osborn's_method) for brainstorming:\n\n1. **Focus on quantity**: enhance divergent thinking\n2. **Don't criticize**: foster greater, risk-free creativity\n3. **welcome unusual ideas**: aid out-of-the-box thinking, leading to unconventional problem solving\n4. **combine and improve ideas**: amalgamation of ideas create better solutions through process of [association](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_of_ideas&useskin=vector)\n\nIn a hackathon, coming up with an idea is the hardest part, but it's my favorite part.\n\nI get to brainstorm with strangers I just met online, sharing interesting ideas and combining our unique backgrounds and skills, to build something fun.\n","data":{"title":"Convergent and Divergent Thinking","tags":"thinking","date":"Nov 14, 2023"},"filePath":"idea.md"},{"content":"\nIn my past 2 years of programming with Python and React in various little hackathon projects and side projects like this blog, I've never really worked much with pull requests or creating branches. I've just been pushing to the main branch.\n\nI'm now working on a hackathon and would like to practice creating branches, writing [good commit messages](https://bneo.xyz/posts/code-pr), merging branches, etc.\n\nI found this [Git Style Guide](https://github.com/agis/git-style-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#messages) inspired by inspired by [How to Get Your Change Into the Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html), and the [git man pages](http://git-scm.com/doc)\n\n### Branches\n\n- use lower case in [branch names](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/collaborate-and-share-your-work/use-github/naming-git-branches/), use hyphens to separate words\n- choose short descriptive names like \"oauth-migration\", not \"login_fix\" (too vague)\n- use identifiers from tickets like `git checkout -b issue-15`\n- delete branch from upstream repo after merging, unless there's good reason not to\n- use `git branch --merged | grep -v \"\\*\"` to list merged branches.\n- [more tips](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848)\n\n### Commits\n\n- when writing, **think about what you would need to know in a year from now** when running across the commit\n- each commit should be a single _logical_ change, ex: if a patch fixes a bug and optimize performance, split into two\n- use `git add -p` to interactively stage specific portions of files\n- don't split a single _logical_ change into several commits (features + tests should be one)\n- <mark>commit early and often</mark> : small, self-contained commits are easier to understand and easy to revert\n- commits should be **ordered logically**, if commit X depends on Y, Y should come before X.\n- [squash](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash) commits using `--squash` and `-fixup`\n\n### Messages\n\n- summary line should be descriptive yet succinct, no longer than 50 chars\n- should not end with a period\n- after that comes a blank line and a more thorough description (72 chars) explaining **why** the change was needed, **how** it addresses the issue, and **what side-effects** it might have\n- it should also provide pointers to related resources (link to issue in bug tracker)\n- if commit A depends on B, state in message of A, and use SHA1 to refer to commits\n\n```txt\nShort (50 chars or fewer) summary of changes\n\nMore detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to\n72 characters. In some contexts, the first\nline is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of\nthe text as the body.  The blank line separating the\nsummary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body\nentirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run\nthe two together.\n\nFurther paragraphs come after blank lines.\n\n- Bullet points are okay, too\n\n- Use a hyphen or an asterisk for the bullet,\n  followed by a single space, with blank lines in\n  between\n\nThe pointers to your related resources can serve as a footer\nfor your commit message. Here is an example that is referencing\nissues in a bug tracker:\n\nResolves: #56, #78\nSee also: #12, #34\n\nSource: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n```\n\n### Merging\n\n- **Do not rewrite published history**\n- keep history clean and simple, before merging\n  - make sure it conforms to style guide, perform actions if it doesn't (squash/reorder, reword messages)\n  - rebase onto branch, so it can be applied directly to end of \"main\" branch and result in a simple history (suited for projects with short-running branches)\n- If your branch includes more than one commit, do not merge with a [fast-forward](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29673993):\n  -

This is why [code reviews](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html#complexity) are needed, to check if the code causes too much cognitive load.\n\nSo, be kind to your coworkers and write clean code.\n\nThe key to reducing cognitive load is to make code simpler.\n\nHere are some principles:\n\n1. **Limit amount of code in a function or file**: [Keep functions small](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html) and limit each class to [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).\n2. **Create abstractions to hide implementation details**: functions and interfaces are [abstraction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs211/2006sp/Lectures/L08-Abstraction/08_abstraction.html) to hide complex details, but don't go overboard.\n3. **Simplify control flow**: too many if statements or loops makes the [control flow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/simplify-your-control-flows.html) hard to understand, hide complex logic with helper functions. Reduce [nesting](https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/06/code-health-reduce-nesting-reduce.html) with early returns.\n4. **Minimize mutable state**: [stateless](https://stackoverflow.com/a/844548) code is easier to understand, avoid mutable class fields, make types [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)\n5. **Include only relevant details in a test**: test can be [hard to follow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/include-only-relevant-details-in-tests.html) if it includes boilerplate test data that is irrelevant\n6. **Don't overuse mocks in tests**: [improper use of mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/05/testing-on-toilet-dont-overuse-mocks.html) -> cluttered test with calls that expose implementation details\n\nHere's a [printer friendly version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgcBG2iOmzEWIKYs6hNDyTMZ-an0SOwmJZRsX898XD0/edit?pli=1).\n","data":{"title":"Clean Code - Google","tags":"programming","date":"Nov 9, 2023"},"filePath":"clean-code.md"},{"content":"\nSoftware engineers do more than just coding.\n\nThe difference between a developer and a great developer is the **breadth and depth** of their approach in **delivering value**.\n\nHere are [8 habits](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers/) of great SWEs.\n\n1. **Focusing beyond the code**: how does the code interact with other components? scaling? maintainability?\n2. **Efficiency** / Antifragility: Making sure everything around you runs smoothly and has forward momentum\n3. **Joy of tinkering**: build projects, try out frameworks, build stuff on the side.

We are aware of our names, our parents, and the milestones of our lives, such as our successes and failures. However, truly grasping our self-concept extends well beyond the mere facts of our personal history.\n\nSelf-concept is deeply intertwined with our self-esteem. It reflects in our belief in our capabilities to overcome challenges, to contribute positively to our world, and in our capacity for self-transformation. These aspects of self-concept are influenced by personal history, but according to Dr. Paul Conti, an individual can enhance their **agency** and ability to achieve goals through a deeper understanding of their self-concept.\n\n### How do we achieve this deeper understanding?\n\nOne effective method is to consciously and deliberately construct a [life narrative](https://youtu.be/CJIXbibQ0jI?si=mtY8J3gJ91xo_4Nb&t=5214).\n\n### What is a Life Narrative?\n\nThe process involves dividing your life into 3-5 year segments. Within these periods, note down in bullet points the life events that seem significant to you. This could encompass hobbies, work experiences, pivotal relationships, personal challenges, or anything else that stands out in your memory. These events could be either positive or negative, or even neutral experiences that continue to resonate with you.\n\n### What to include?\n\nIt's crucial to include moments that you fear you might forget, moments that you believe define you. The aim isn't to draft a seamless life story, but to create a collage of vital personal experiences.\n\n### Developing a Historical Sense of Self\n\nBy documenting these life segments, you cultivate a historical sense of self, which contributes to your understanding of your past, present, and potentially, your future.

More machine learning fundamentals interviews (things like logistic regression, probability fundamentals, vector calculus, and math puzzles).\n- The **robotics engineer** interviews: fun systems questions. extremely specific to robotics, less time talking about ML or RL.\n\n### Most common questions\n\n- What do you want to work on when you show up? Who do you want to work with? If you had unlimited compute what would you work on?\n- What was a past project you worked on? What was the impact? What did you learn?\n- What styles of communication do you prefer? Do you work in teams? Do you value mentorship?\n\n## Actionable Tips\n\n- **Coding Practice**: Consistent coding practice, such as using LeetCode premium.\n- **ML Background Interviews**: While tricky, preparing for \"ML Background\" interviews (math tricks and basic ML tradeoffs) through coursework study can be advantageous.\n- **Job Talk Preparation**: Emphasize a strong narrative and vision in your job talk, focusing less on technical detail and more on **engaging storytelling**.\n- **Research Agenda**: Clearly outlining a research agenda with timelines and goals can clarify your process and intentions for starting new projects.\n- **Saying No**: Be willing to decline unreasonable demands from companies; most are flexible and aim for a positive candidate experience.\n- **Interview Topics**: Inquire about interview preparation topics; recruiters might provide specific areas to focus on, such as programming concepts or problem-solving domains.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [AI Paygrades](https://aipaygrad.es/)\n- [2023 ML/AI Researcher Salary Report: Insights and Strategies for Successful Negotiation](https://www.teamrora.com/post/ai-researchers-salary-negotiation-report-2023)\n- [The last reliable (available) path into AI](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/path-into-ai)\n- [The AI research job market sh\\*t show (and my experience)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/ai-research-job-market)\n- [Behind the curtain: what it feels like to work in AI right now (April 2023)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/behind-the-curtain-ai)\n","data":{"title":"Job Hunt as a PhD in AI","tags":"AI, work","date":"Nov 3, 2023"},"filePath":"ai-jobs.md"},{"content":"\nCatboost is an open-source ML [Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting?useskin=vector) Boosted Decision [Trees](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests/intro-to-gbdt) algorithm, it's name come from the terms “Category” and “Boosting.” It was developed by Yandex (Russian Google ) in 2017\n\nKey [attributes](https://neptune.ai/blog/when-to-choose-catboost-over-xgboost-or-lightgbm) of Catboost:\n\n- ranking objective function\n- native categorical features preprocessing\n- model analysis\n- fastest prediction time\n  - [30-60x](https://www.joinplank.com/articles/xgboost-catboost-lightgbm) faster as documented by real companies\n  - on GPUs it is 50-100x times faster than XGBoost.\n- performs remarkably well with default parameters, significantly improving performance when tuned\n- utilising ideas such as Ordered Target Statistics from online learning, CatBoost considers datasets sequential in time and permutes them\n  - By creating the concept of artificial time 🕰️ CatBoost cleverly reduces Prediction Shift, inherent in the traditional Gradient Boosting models such as XGBoost and LightGBM.\n- 8X faster inference than XGBoost\n  - build better trees 🌲 that result in better regularisation and speed, especially during inference\n\n## References\n\n- [The Gradient Boosters V: CatBoost – Deep & Shallow](https://deep-and-shallow.com/2020/02/29/the-gradient-boosters-v-catboost/)\n- [XGBoost?

We both dreamt of working at FAANG companies in the US, and share the same passion starting a company until today. I still remember the first orientation day, I went into this big hall filled with rows upon rows of students fresh out of high school, each with their own unique passions and dreams. I remember feeling anxious and alone until I saw a familiar face in one of the seats at the back.\n\nW convinced me to join the American University Program Club as committees, and I'm grateful he did. All of us in the committee became good friends. We took classes together, had lunch together at various places in SS15, and crammed for exams together at the one-floor library. We would go out for movies, have kbbq buffet together, celebrate birthdays at the mall. I remember spending a lot of my time in the freezing computer room at the library, writing medium articles and doing assignments. I remember stay late till 9 p.m. making decorations and preparing for our Halloween event.\n\nThen in 2020, COVID hit and the familiar faces became pixelated and their voices became digital. I never had to take a 1.5 hour train ride every day to campus anymore, but not being able to be around them anymore in person was sad.\n\nNow, we're all split and we don't really keep in touch anymore, but it was a point in my life where I was healthy, and I will always remember it fondly.\n\nI took a gap semester after finishing up all my units at INTI in **Summer 2020**, and I spent my time completing online courses on R and Machine Learning and reading fiction books. I enjoyed the time with my family at home. I did a lot of home workouts, I went out for jogs, I could spend the entire day just reading a book, and I was able to pursue what I was interested in. I distinctly remember reading a few pages of Crime and Punishment every night at 12 a.m. before bed in the living room, eating digestive biscuits with hot soy milk, sucked into the compelling world of Russian literature. I barely had any social interactions with people other that my family, but as an introvert, that worked out well.\n\nThen, **Jan 2021** came, and to say my life changed is an understatement. My life was struck by a disease that slowly ate away my health, physically and mentally. I went through physical turmoil, psychological torture, and experienced utter helplessness in search for a cure to the suffering.\n\nWhat I initially thought was just a minor issue with my body turned into an (now almost) 3 year fight against GERD.\n\nAfter the medicine from the first clinic didn't work, I went to a second clinic, and a hospital, and it was a slow realization, as I switched from one medicine to the next, that what I have is chronic.\n\nThe first big change was my sleep. I slept flat initially and was having burning sensations in my chest and breathing issues. I played the cover of \"Green Eyes\" and Okinawa by 92914 every night to sleep because I couldn't stand the pain. I found out that I had to sleep at an incline, and it's been that way since. You can imagine the discomfort of not being able to lie down flat, it's torture. It's like not being able to take in a deep breath, or an itch that you can never scratch. I envy people who lay flat on the ground at parks, can you imagine that?\n\nThe second biggest change was my diet. I slowly realized the amount of limitations placed on my diet as days turned into weeks, and into months. My two favorite things at that time: green tea and chocolate was out of my life from that day. Anything with pepper is off limits. I could no longer drink ice cold carbonated drinks on a hot day. I couldn't take sips of alcohol or eat mandarin oranges during Chinese New Years. No more fried chicken from Texas Chicken. No eating the crispy skin on roasted pork. And so much more. At that time, I lived on a diet of thin-noodle soup and fish paste which my mum made most days at home. It became my favorite food.\n\nThe third was my fitness. I couldn't exert my body the same way I could before. I no longer had the freedom to push myself physically, to go for jogs that made me feel alive and out of breath. All I could do was pedal the stationary bike in my house at a suitable pace. My body has been deteriorating since then. Aside from the occasional bicep curls that I can do, and that time I tried to lay down to do a bench. My body can no longer perform the way it used to.\n\nBasically, I could no longer do and eat 90% of the things I could before.\n\nI went through all this at that time, while taking midnight online classes in from ISU **Spring and Summer 2021**.\n\nMy friends never knew about my condition, and I spent most of my time home. It felt like I was battling this alone.\n\nI was switched several kinds of medications for months, and was recommended antidepressants to treat anxiety, because it's one of the triggers for GERD. Even though they relieved the symptoms, it was still creeping there. I was just never the same. I had to rely on these pills to keep me functioning, they literally reduce the amount of acid being produced in my stomach.\n\nI'm grateful for the support I have from my family to help me deal with the disease. I thought about how much worse it would be if I had this disease, but not have caring parents or the financial capabilities to seek health care.\n\nIn **August 2021**, it was time for me to fly to the US.\n\nMy best friend decided to stay in Malaysia, while I fly to the US with two of my other friends and my sister. When I first arrived, it felt nice. I've been stuck in my home for more than a year, and now I'm in a new environment with new people. I remember orientation where groups were formed, names were exchanged, and dozens booths with free stuff, the grass and the sun. I felt more free, even though I was still trapped in this body.\n\nI wasn't very socially adept, and I spent a lot of my time with the friends that I came here with.\n\nLiving with J was stressful, and only nice 20% of the time. Maybe some of his actions shaped me the way I am today, but I believe you can help people improve without making them feel bad about themselves. Denigrating others and placing that much unnecessary pressure on someone is not right.\n\nI had my first interview from the career fair, and then my second interview got pulled because I wasn't a citizen. From then on, I realized how hard it is for international students. I started fervently applying online in hopes of getting lucky. I did a lot of one-sided interviews, and continued with interviews as I was back Malaysia during winter. I don't remember much about what I did in Malaysia but it probably involved seeing doctors.\n\nAs I got back to the US in **Spring 2022**, I was told I got the offer for one of the companies. They wanted me to start asap. But because of the \"no working in the first two semester of arriving in the US restriction\" for F1 students, I couldn't take the offer. It was really defeating.\n\nMy health also got bad to the point where I had to get a medical reduced course load because I could not swallow food at all. I also found it hard to breathe. I arrived for a week and I already wanted to go back home.Eventually, medicine got me back on my feet for the time being. And it was during this time when I fell in love with hackathons. I did them back to back on weekends, and I loved the thrill.\n\nThe highlight of 2022 was my Tesla internship in **Summer 2022**. A big part of who I am and what I want today stems from the experiences I had and the people I met in the bay area. Even though I didn't like the work I did the most, being in California expanded my horizons. The world felt really small in Ames, IA. In California, I felt like it was what I was missing the whole time. I felt like I belonged. I had dozens of new experiences and made some of my closest friends during that time, albeit I did had to take PPIs the entire time to sustain myself, it made me feel like I could still live a life with GERD.\n\nIn **Fall 2022**, I was living in a new apartment. My sister helped move us out of that prison over the summer and she had to face the attacks and rage of J. It significantly improved my living conditions and it's something I should be more grateful about.\n\nI grew really depressed at this time. I felt like I was trapped in Iowa and wanted to go back to California. I realized how little this place could offer me. There's no where I can go besides the library to do my work. It's the same restaurants with sub-par food. And I couldn't fill my time with gym or any kinds of sports. I began to resent Iowa. I missed not being able to go for trips to the beach, or take the train to SF chinatown, or just be around my friends. I felt like coming to ISU was a bad decision. I should've had more agency, instead of applying here because my friends were doing it too.\n\nI started another round of internship hunt, in hopes of getting a better position in California. I stopped my medication and my condition worsened. I also started to develop really bad skin conditions (genetical) that felt like another punishment on top of GERD, and it was a lot to bear. This skin condition made me fear sugar and foods with high GI index. My food options was constrained even further. You can imagine how hard it is to avoid sugar in the US. Everything I buy in grocery stores, I look at the \"Total Sugar\" amount.\n\nI've never had confidence with my smile, because it's been crooked since I was in high school and I've dying to get it straightened till this day. And this skin condition just made it worse. I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt like I'll never be able to be with someone. That I was a deformed and unlovable. It was really hard to internalize why this was happening to me. GERD is very likely genetical, and this skin condition as well. Ever since these two disease started to consume my life, my relationship with my parents were challenged. It's really easy to blame others for genetical diseases, even though they had no part in causing it, I just have no where else to direct it too. Face time calls with my mom always revolves around the issues with my body and nothing else. I don't want her to feel bad or worried, with me being so far away, but I just can't help it. I can't fake being ok, cause I'm not.\n\nThis condition also made me get really paranoid about sweating. So all this just felt like everything was getting worse. It feels like it's going downhill ever since 2021 and I notice a pattern of issues just arising in my body.\n\nFinals were done and the early internship hunt was not a success. After the semester ended, I visited Tokyo (it was really fun) and went back to Malaysia in the winter.\n\nWhen people talk about going home, they talk about all the food they get to eat, the friends they could see again, and the health checkups to make sure they're prepared for the lack of health support in the US.\n\nWhen I went back, it was largely about dealing with my stomach and skin conditions. I had to meet with a Korean doctor with an Oriental medicine background every week. My skin condition was serious. It was weekly sessions of just delivering pure and raw pain and psychological turmoil. I was being tortured for something I couldn't control. I already had a condition that has no cure (without surgery), and with this on top of it, it just felt like I was cursed. It felt like God hated me. I did another GERD scope, which the conclusion was basically I developed a Type I hernia from doing situps and I just have to deal with that with strong medicine and lifestyle changes. Not very helpful if you ask me.\n\nI did get to eat some of the food I enjoyed, got to see my friend group from college. One month passes by really quick.\n\nI came back to the US and endured the cold, freezing weather of Iowa again, and started **Spring 2023**. The cold aggravates my symptoms, it squeezes my core. I can't wear clothing that's too tight cause of my skin condition. I felt broken.\n\nI started attending a Chinese church at this time, and they provided a lot of support. The elderly people were super kind and caring, it felt like home. I stopped going church in 2022 because the bigger churches felt so lonely, and the disease was really shaking my faith. It was hard to accept that God would place this on me. It's easy to say suffering builds tolerance, and it makes you stronger, and you will come out of this a better person. But I'm going through all this right now, living it day by day, at this very second, it's still there. When will it end?\n\nMy skin conditions came back in March and I had to take antibiotics. I went through a lot of discomfort. I hated my body. Eventually the antibiotics helped and things started to look better. My colleague reached out to me and asked if I wanted to go back to the team for the summer. I failed Glassdoor's 3-round interview, so going back was the only option.\n\n**Summer 23**. It was really nice to be back. I got to see old friends and make new ones. I went for a lot of AI events and hackathons, it felt unreal being in the same room with CEOs and YC founders, sitting at the same table with stanford Ph.D. students, and staying up all night at the ferry building in San Francisco for my app to be presented and awarded. I went to my first american party (and another one later on), although it was more like a networking event since everyone were interns. My parents came to visit for 3 weeks and it was nice driving them around to touristy spots, and eat good food. They liked it a lot, especially since I was paying for everything. I felt like an adult for the first time. It was 14 weeks filled with adventure, thrill, and lots of networking. I'm a little more confident in speaking now, although still trying to be less awkward. During this time, I got back on PPIs cause it started to flare up, but the in-house Tesla doctors told me to stop taking them, because my bones will break easier due to the side effects of long term PPIs. I was worried. So I switched to something else that was less effective, but less harmful. I eventually stopped taking them when I felt better.\n\nLeaving California again was hard. My old friends came back full time, and I felt like I was delaying my life. I also had only one more class to graduate, and I was contemplating a lot about coming back to Iowa. But now I'm glad I did. I was really burnt out in California, and never took the time to rest.\n\n**Fall 2023**. The first few weeks being back was hard, I felt really bored. Not because I didn't have anything to do, but because what used to be 8 hours of work, and then outings and events after work hours and in the weekends turned into 2 hours of classes a week.\n\nI got a chance to visit Toronto in September for the Airflow summit. It was my first all-paid-for conference and it was fun to say the least. I got to meet two of my friends from last summer. We caught up with dim-sum and hotpot, and I'm glad I got to see them again, and hope to in the future. I walked around UofT, saw a protest, and got to meet interesting people.\n\nLately I've been busy applying to grad school with my best friend from college. He never got to come to the US and now I'm hoping we go to the same grad school and work on our company together. I've been doing hackathons again, writing articles, working on side projects. Having more time on my hands is a curse and a blessing. A lot of the work is intrinsically motivated.\n\nI don't see my friends as often anymore cause we don't take the same classes. We just celebrated one of their birthdays and it's nice to be able to sit down and have dinner with them. It almost feels bittersweet. 2 years passed by quickly. I start to remember all the dinners we had together, the assignments we worked on, and the discord calls. I don't know where each of us will be next year.\n\nMy skin condition came back this month, and it killed me. I had a lot of breakdowns this semester. I would sit on the carpeted floor in my bedroom just spiralling and tearing up.\n\nIt hurts in the shower, so I blast worship music and sing in the bathroom to deal with the pain. I feel anger, sadness, disgust all at the same time. I've spent days crying in the bathroom saying I can't take this anymore.\n\nIt's scary to not feel comfortable with seeking healthcare as an international student because of the cost. Apparently I was dealing with my condition using the wrong methods (which seemed right at that time), and it was making it worse. Now I'm left with bandages and ointments and antibiotics every day, in hopes of a fast recovery for my Boston trip.\n\nSo that brings me to **today**.\n\nI had a good birthday celebration. I spent it with people I love and care about. I got wishes from my close friends, and it made me realize how blessed it is to have them in my life. And how much I appreciate them being in my life.\n\nThe past 2 years of my life has been revolving around these issues, these rules that helps avoid triggering these diseases, and it's still hard for me to accept it.\n\nI stopped medication a while now, but my symptoms come and go, the most frequent one being the heartburns that induces asthma like symptoms and the stabbing pain in my lower-left abdomen. And the occasional sore throat and ulcers at the back of my tongue. I wake up feeling horrible, and never well rested, and I can never figure out if it's because of my conditions.\n\nI'm terrified that this is my life now and I hate this life. I'll never be able to life like a normal person. I won't get the chance to be drunk at parties. To bar hop with friends late night in NYC. To just be able to try out new foods and desserts without worrying about whether it is worth the risk of utter pain and maybe cancer or my skin condition developing. To backpack across europe and go on crazy hikes. Doing fun and dumb things that a young person in his 20s get to do. To get married and have kids. To just be.\n\nMy mom keeps telling me to focus on what I still can do, and it's not a lot. I try to see a silver lining, but it's suffocating to be in this body. Most days I can distract myself with writing, coding side projects, with good kpop music, but at the end of it all, I'm still sick. When it's quiet and I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm consumed with fear.\n\nI was asked what did I learn from this condition that I have today. Here's my attempt at answering that.\n\nI learned that my faith wasn't as strong as I thought. It's easy to believe in God when things are going well. But when you're struck down with diseases and your health is stolen away from you, like Job, can you still sustain? Will you hold strong in believing, with no guarantee that things will be better? Right now I'm still battling with this.\n\nI learned that in tough times, it's so easy to spiral in circles and not see a way out. It feels like everything is closing in and this is everything, and it's forever, that it won't change. With issues that takes time to heal, where progress is not immediate, it's hard to visualize that things do get better. Under duress, my brain focuses on the current too much. I've found that talking to people helps, and I'm the kind that would rather suffer in silence than ask for help so it's been challenging. Or talking in the third person, and rationalizing through the situation and repeating \"It's going to be ok\" and \"This is not forever\"\n\nI learned that there are issues that people are facing that you can't see. People see me and think I'm healthy and fine, and I'm not. I'm disabled. So it's better to be kind to everyone, even when I'm in pain, I try to make other people's lives better. I'm still selfish at times, especially with my family, and that's something I'm working on.\n\nI learned that gratitude is essential to deal with big life issues, and might be the precursor to radical acceptance. If I was more grateful with what I do have in my life, if I'm around people I love, these issues fade away. It used to be all there is, it clouded my thoughts, but through gratitude, it becomes smaller.\n\nI'm going back Malaysia after graduating to hopefully fix most of my health issues.\n\nI suffered through the whole ISU experience in hopes of achieving the FAANG dream, and if not that, I could've went back to Tesla. It would be a nice life still. But I can't.\n\nHere's hoping that in the midst of suffering and despair, I see a way out of it.\n\nPeople say I sound dead and tired, and I honestly don't know whether I was like this all the time, or the accumulation of suffering over years that rendered me like this. People say suffering builds strength, but it seems to just be making me worn out and tired. Maybe I'm just not strong enough. I find it hard to garner up the energy to do things nowadays. I'm just tired of everything.\n\nI thought a lot about how to continue living a meaningful life in the face of trials and tribulations. How to live when you're limited in so many ways and life seems to be working against you. When things that used to provide joy are off-limits. When a basic need like health, something a lot of people take granted for, is not met. And there's little you can do about it besides medicine, where you suffer the side effects later on in life. A life time of medicine.\n\nBut who knows. Maybe I'm just overthinking things and being emotional as a 22 year old who's never faced big life challenges until this happened to me.\n\nI know life is never fair, and life is suffering. And I like to believe that God only places as much suffering in your life as you can bear. He also places people in your life to help you get through them. So far, I feel less alone.\n\nMaybe I live with this disease for the rest of my life, but I adapt and it could still be meaningful.\n\nOr maybe years into the future, I'm healthy again, looking back at my life in my early 20s and remember only the good parts.\n","data":{"title":"Turning 22","tags":"personal, journal","date":"Oct 28, 2023"},"filePath":"22.md"},{"content":"\nSix [skills](https://levelupsoftwareengineering.substack.com/p/6-skills-required-to-be-a-senior) one should develop to grow into senior+ SWE positions.\n\n1.

add a new feature.\n\nInstead of applying for grad school and writing my personal statement, I've been putting it off because I'm afraid when I write it, I'll have to face the fact that I'm not a good

procrastination](https://www.structuredprocrastination.com/) by John Perry, a philosophy professor at Stanford.\n\nThe gist of it is you can **use procrastination to your advantage** to get other things done.\n\nYou have a list of tasks that you have to do, ordered by importance.\n\nThe tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top.\n\nBut there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down.\n\nBy doing those tasks, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen, acquiring the reputation for getting a lot done.\n\nThere is always something you have to do that you're putting off, and while you're procrastinating, just do lots of other stuff instead.\n\nThe trick here is to pick the right sort of projects for the top of the list.\n\nThe two characteristics of such tasks

Compute **test statistic** that measures size of apparent effect. It could be a difference between two groups, absolute difference in means, see more examples [here](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/06/more-hypotheses-less-trivia.html). We call this test statistic 𝛿\n2. Define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model of the world under which the assumption that effect is not real, ex: if you think there is a difference between group A and B, H0 = there is no difference between A and B.\n3. Model of null hypothesis should be [stochastic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic), that is, capable of simulating data similar to original data.\n4. Goal: compute p-value (probability of seeing an effect as big as 𝛿 under null hypothesis). You can estimate p-value using **simulation**: calculate the same test statistic you used on the actual data for each simulation.\n5. Count the fraction of times the test statistic exceeds 𝛿. This fraction approximates p-value. If it's sufficiently small, you can conclude that the apparent effect is [unlikely due to chance](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/05/hypothesis-testing-is-only-mostly.html).\n\n## Why simulation?\n\n- analytical methods are slow and expensive, but even as computation gets faster, they are appealing because they are\n  - **inflexible**: using a standard test -> particular test statistic and model, might not be appropriate for problem domain.\n  - **opaque**: real-world scenario has many possible models, based on different assumptions. In standard tests, assumptions are implicit, not easy to know whether model is appropriate.\n- simulation on the other hand, are\n  - **explicit**: creating a simulation forces you to think about your modeling decisions, the simulations themselves document those decisions.\n  - **arbitrarily flexible**: can try out several test statistics and models, can choose most appropriate one for the scenario.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Statistical Rethinking 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) ([website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/))\n- [Hypothesis testing - Think Stats 2e](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html)\n","data":{"title":"Testing","tags":"statistics","date":"Oct 17, 2023"},"filePath":"testing.md"},{"content":"\nOn how to be a good codemate by [Brian Lee](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/codemates/).\n\nSome takeaways/interesting points:\n\n- It has everything to do with settings expectations on how you communicate and collaborate within a shared codebase, not your coding ability or quality\n- tell your teammates how to **test your workflow**, hook the script (unit test, integration test, or bash script) into CI so your codemates can't accidentally break you, [tests](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html#the_beyonceacutesemicolon_rule) are the only scalable way to inform your team on how to not break your code.\n- changes requiring manual steps need to be **announced publicly**, ex: updated dependency, changes in AWS account permissions. The pro move is to use tools that transparently and automatically install and use currently checked-in configs\n- effort in writing actual code is in equal parts of packaging code that satisfies all automated linters, test coverage requirements, links to tickets, and other blocking requirements\n- adopt mindset of investing in formatters that automatically fix formatting issues, than linters that nag you about issues\n- One common toe-stepping maneuver is refactoring - renaming modules, moving functions/classes around. Merge conflicts are inevitable\n- Refactoring benefits: compress mental map needed to understand how the codebase works.\n- Refactoring cost: people need to relearn their mental map, a needless refactor is like sorting a bookshelf by color - unnecessary and productivity killer\n- Two rules for refactoring: (1) **Don't Refactor**, get formatting and naming right the [first time](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/noutils/), (2) **don't mix refactors with feature changes**, refactoring changes are 10-100x easier to review than normal feature-adding changes. Look at [Google monorepo](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext#FNF) for managing refactors at larger scale\n- flake tests build up in CI, causing it to rerun multiple time before passing, CI runtime only increase, and eventually people stop trusting CI. senior eng become reviewing bottlenecks.\n- Adopt \"leap of faith\" strategy and pretend CI can be trusted, and figure out tests that can catch your mistakes, and add it. The cost of breaking main branch is equally expensive to suffer through worry-laden code review process.\n- Have a quick rollback procedure to mitigate accidental breakage.\n- The ultimate solution is to embrace [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), shard codebase along organizational lines, reduce O(n^2) cost of coordinating people's work\n","data":{"title":"Codemate","tags":"work, programming","date":"Oct 16, 2023"},"filePath":"codemate.md"},{"content":"\nFound this 22-minute [article](https://ncase.me/mental-health/) that's a mix of personal story, science of mental health, and practical tips.\n\nIt's also a \"companion piece\" for an interactive story game called \"[Adventures with Anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)\"\n\nHere is the [TL;DR](https://ncase.me/mental-health/#toc_18)\n\n- Do not fear fear itself\n- [Pain](https://ncase.me/mental-health/#toc_2) is a protector\n- Fear is a guard dog for your needs\n- **All feelings are imperfect [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_accounts_of_emotion) about met/unmet needs**\n- Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, \"becoming a better person\" needs\n- **Healthy people don't \"cope\" with emotions, they collaborate with them.

More **state and federal incentives** to build an **infrastructure for collection** is needed.\n\n### challenges of recycling\n\nThe vast [majority](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/sustainability/how-is-plastic-recycled-a-step-by-step-guide-to-recycling.aspx) of \"recycling\" is grinding plastic, melting it, and re-forming it. This mechanical recycling well involves properly sorting and cleaning materials, which is time intensive and expensive.\n\nIt's also very [difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/)/impossible to recycle many types of plastic more than once without causing the material to acquire **defects and [contaminants](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/recycling-contamination/)** (many recycled materials contain high levels of unwanted toxins)\n\n### local policies for recycling\n\nLocal policies make a huge difference.\n\nMaine and Oregon invested in recycling programs, and up to 80% of bottles made from PET ([polyethylene terephthalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)) are recycled. In some states, such as in the South, that percentage is in the single digits.\n\nThe national average for these materials is 30%.\n\nSome states have policies that [hinder progress](https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/).\n\nIndustry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute [state-level laws](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation) that **prevent** bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags.\n\nOver a dozen states currently have [preemptive laws](https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/preemption/) on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics\n\n### Improving recycling\n\nOne, simplify and standardize process of plastic production. Currently more than 10,000 chemicals are used, and upward 3,200 have \"one or more [hazardous properties](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report) of concern\"\n\nSecond, find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials, instead of having to sort everything first. For example, [chemical process](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.2c00402) that can [transform several types of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/30/1063837/how-chemists-are-tackling-the-plastics-problem/) into propane, and using [soil bacterium](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4626) to break down plastics and re-form them to bioplastics.\n\nThird, using microbes that can break down and recycle [PET](https://www.americanbeverage.org/education-resources/blog/post/what-is-pet/). One company doing this is [Carbios](https://www.carbios.com/en/). A [microbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideonella_sakaiensis) discovered in Japan in 2016 was the first one identified that can live solely on plastic as a food source.\n\n### reducing demand\n\nTo solve the problem in the plastic pollution crisis, we must solve the root problem: _plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap_\n\nPolymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require **policy and behavioral changes** small and large.\n\nTiny changes can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution.\n\nExample: policymakers in Washington, DC instituted five-cent charge on plastic bags in 2010, and estimates show number of bags dropped by more than half in months, and quantity found in [local waterways dropped 30%-70%](https://gwhatchet.com/2018/02/07/district-tax-leads-to-sharp-decrease-in-plastic-bag-use/)\n\nA global [Extended Producer Responsibility](https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm) scheme would be an example of a major shift.\n\nChange will be difficult, but they can be instituted in a way that don't hurt businesses.\n\nCreating incentives for alternatives -> innovation and new jobs.\n","data":{"title":"Plastic is everywhere","tags":"climate","date":"Oct 12,

Broadly, they are filled with joy, that it is Ivan who died, not them\n\nThinking about death from time to time is a good practice. Memento mori. I hope to truly live, and to be surrounded with people I love, and leave this world in peace.\n\n> A life poorly lived only amplifies the horrors of death or create them entirely.

Select the right mentor(s)\n\n- finding suitable mentors is a process of judgement and learning, there needs to be congruence between your goals and the skills and knowledge of the mentor\n- Find someone with content expertise, or influence in a field, who has a wide network of contacts\n- Someone in the top of their field isn't necessarily a good mentor, personal attributes (patience) and values (altruism) are fundamental to a good relationship. You should like, respect and trust your mentor.\n\n### 2. Be respectful of your mentor's time and manage it wisely\n\n- Be proactive in scheduling appointments, plan a regular slot\n- Plan for meetings by setting out agendas and prioritising discussion points\n- Include a timeline to schedule each item so the both of you focus on what is important\n- Propose solutions to help your mentor decide which answer may be best (\"managing up\")\n- request actions before meetings to help your mentor prepare \"Please review X so we can discuss at our meeting\"\n\n### 3. Communicate efficiently and effectively\n\n- begin with honest conversations regarding your goals and aspirations\n- include a written plan of short and long term goals, which helps share a vision of success with your mentor\n- Clarify roles and expectations on both sides to minimise conflict and disappointment.\n- establish regular cadence of communication that includes goals and progress towards them, for example: summary of current project status, including progress and problems, discussion of new projects, etc.\n- pay attention to your \"talking-to-listening ratio\", it should be less than one. You should be listening more than you are talking.\n- Send focused messages with brief background that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\" are ideal\n\n### 4. Be engaged, energising, and collaborative\n\n- avoid emotionally draining behaviours, such as complaining, pessimism, and \"snarking\" about others.\n- Show that you are mature and genuinely open to learning\n- be an energy donor, not an energy recipient\n- help drive projects forward, be proactive, and accept all comments as important learning opportunities\n- Be a \"closer\" : someone who follows through on tasks in timely fashion and at a high standard.\n- Be generous and honest in giving others credit, you're working with not just your mentor, but other colleagues and the wider scientific community.\n","data":{"title":"Golden Rules of Effective Menteeship","tags":"career, work","date":"Sep 24, 2023"},"filePath":"mentee.md"},{"content":"\n[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) (data build tool) is a CLT that enables data analyst and [engineers](https://www.getdbt.com/data-teams/hiring-data-engineer) to transform data in their [data warehouses](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/data-warehouse) more effectively.\n\n### where\n\ndbt is the T in [ETL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/etl).\n\nIt doesn't extract or load, but it sits on top of your warehouse and transforms data that's already loaded.\n\nThis is known as [ELT](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/elt).\n\nELT is becoming more prevalent because data warehouses like Bigquery and Snowflake are extremely performant and scalable, that transformations can be more effectively handed in-database rather than elsewhere.\n\n### What\n\nSo [what](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt) does it do?\n\nThe only function of dbt is to take code, compile it to SQL, and run it against your database.\n\nAt the most basic level, it's a compiler and a runner.\n\nYou write dbt code in a text editor of your choice, or the [IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) in dbt cloud, and run dbt in the cli.\n\ndbt compiles all the code into raw sql, and execute it against a configured data warehouse.\n\ndbt code has two core workflows: **building** data [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models) and **testing** data models\n\n### building models\n\nA data model is any transformed [view](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/view) of raw data.\n\nTo create a model, you write a SQL SELECT statement. dbt then builds it in the database, materializing it as a view or [table](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/table).\n\nThis model then can be queried by other models or analytical tools.\n\n[Materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations) means the strategy ([DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl)) by which a data model is built in the warehouse. Or in other words, the manner in which data is represented.\n\n### testing\n\nYou can [test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests) the integrity of SQL in each model by making assertions.\n\nYou can test for things like:\n\n- whether a specificed column only has non-null or unique\n- values that have a corresponding value in another model\n- values from a list\n- custom tests that suit business logic\n\nThere are two ways to define a test: singular and generic.\n\nSingular tests is test in its simplest form. You write a SQL query that returns failing rows, save it in a .sql file in your test directory.\n\nGeneric tests are parameterized queries that accept arguments. they can be reused over and over, and are defined in a test block.\n\nThey're defined in a .yml file in `models` directory\n\nOut of the box, dbt ships with four generic tests already defined: unique, not_null, accepted_values and relationships.\n\n### dbt code\n\nWhat is dbt code exactly?\n\nit's a combination of SQL and Jinja, a common templating language used in Python.\n\nFor example, `ref()` is a function that gives users the ability to reference other models in their code.\n\nref does two things: interpolates itself into raw SQL as the appropriate schema.table, and it automatically builds [DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dag) of all the models in a project.\n\nWith Jinja, you can do if statements, loops, macros, and gives SQL superpowers.\n\n### modular code\n\ndbt also has additional functions and variables, where you can express logic that checks if code is running in dev vs prod, state of database. etc.\n\nThis allows you to write modular code that can automate complicated and time-consuming tasks.\n\nThis means dbt gives users powerful tools to build, ship and share their own transformations.\n\nWhich is why dbt ships with a package manager.\n\nSo to summarize everything, here's why dbt is so [powerful](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction):\n\n- avoid writing boilerplate [DML](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dml) and [DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl), just write SELECT statements and dbt takes cares of materialization\n- build reusable, modular data models that can be referenced\n- reduce the time it takes for queries to run with metadata\n- Use Jinja in SQL for control structures, macros, hooks\n- Publish packages that can be referenced by otherse\n- Use source control processes like branching, PRs\n- Write data quality tests quickly and easily\n- [document](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation) descriptions for each model and field\n- snapshots your data to track changes or reconstruct historic values\n","data":{"title":"What is dbt?","tags":"tech, explained","date":"Sep 23, 2023"},"filePath":"dbt.md"},{"content":"\n> Do the most important things first in the day and don’t let anybody stop you.

This often leads to uncovering new insights and connections that might not be apparent through mere reading or listening.\n- **Articulation**: Putting thoughts into words forces a person to clarify their understanding. This process of articulation helps in identifying areas where the understanding might be vague or incomplete.\n- **Reflection**: Writing allows for reflection on the subject matter, enabling the learner to connect new information with existing knowledge. This synthesis helps in creating a more robust and interconnected understanding of the subject.\n- **Revelation of Gaps**: Sometimes, the act of writing reveals areas where the knowledge is lacking or inconsistent. Recognizing these gaps is the first step towards filling them and achieving a more complete understanding.\n\nApply the feynman technique when writing:\n\n1. Choose a concept you want to learn about.\n2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student. Use simple language and avoid jargon\n3. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.\n4. Simplify and use analogies.\n5.

A new UX for asking questions of code, and get answers through iteratively searching, browsing, navigating, and reading code\n2. Code is already designed to be understood by machines, so we should take advantage of that structure. It also has unique requirements; we want to search for punctuation, no stemming, keep stop words, and search with regex.\n3. Github scale is a unique challenge. Deploying on elasticsearch took months to index (8 mil repos). Today there are 200m. It's not static, and it's constantly changing. Right now, you can search **45 mil repos**, representing **115 TB of code** and **15.5b documents**.\n\n## just use grep\n\nIn programming, always start with what the naive approach; in this case, it's grep.\n\nLet's do a little napkin math.\n\nOn a machine with 8 core intel CPU, [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) can run an exhaustive regex query on a 13GB file cached in memory in 2.76 seconds.\n\nThis isn't going to work with the amount of data they have.\n\nCode search runs on 64 core, 32 machine clusters.\n\nEven if they put 115 TB of code in memory, assuming perfect parallelization of work, they're going to saturate 2,048 CPU cores for 96 seconds to serve a single query.\n\nAnd only that one query can run. This comes up to 0.01 queries per second (QPS).\n\nThere's no cost-effective way to scale this approach to all of Github's code.\n\nWe need to build an index.\n\n## Search index primer\n\nTo speed up queries, we need to pre-compute a bunch of information in the form of indices.\n\nThere are two indexing techniques: **forward and inverted index**.\n\nA [forward index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing#The_forward_index) stores a list of words for each document.\n\nAn [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) would be the opposite, mapping content to a set of documents that contain them.\n\nFor code search, they built a special type of inverted index called [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) index, useful for looking up substrings of content.\n\nTo perform a search, they intersect the results of multiple lookups to give the list of documents where the string appears. With a trigram index, there's four lookups for the query \"limits\" : `lim`, `imi`, `mit`, and `its`.\n\nUnlike a hashmap, these indices are too big to fit into memory.\n\nWe build **iterators** to lazily return sorted document IDs (based on ranking of each document) and we intersect and union the iterators and read far enough to fetch the requested number of results. This way they never have to keep the entire entire posting list.\n\n## Indexing 45 million repos\n\nwe have the technique, now to to figure out how to built the index efficiently.\n\nwe need to figure out some insights into the data we have which guides our approach.\n\nwe know two things: Git's use of [content addressable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage?useskin=vector) and that there's a lot of duplicate content on GitHub.\n\nThis leads us to two decisions:\n\n1. Shard by Git [blob](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) object ID.\n   - nice way to evenly distributed docs between shards while avoiding duplication.\n   - scale no. of shards as necessary\n2. Model index as tree\n   - use delta encoding to reduce amount of crawling and to optimize metadata\n   - metadata = list of locations for documents (path, branch, repo) and info about the objects (repo name, owner, visibility)\n\n## building the index\n\nTo ingest all the repositories for the first time, one key property is we **optimize the order** which we do the initial ingest to **make the most of delta encoding**.\n\nWe do this by using a novel probabilistic data structure representing repository similarity and by driving ingest order from a level order traversal of a MST of a graph of repository similarity.\n\nUsing this order, each repo is crawled by diffing it against its parent in the delta tree. This means we only need to crawl blobs unique to that repo, not the entire repo.\n\nHere's the process.\n\n1. Kafka provides events (`git push`) that tells us to index something.\n2. A bunch of crawlers interact with Git and a service to extract symbols from code.\n3. Kafka is used again to allow each shard to consume documents for indexing.\n4. The data is partitioned between shards. Each shard consumes a single Kafka partition in the topic.\n   - **Indexing is decoupled from crawling** through the use of Kafka and the **ordering** of messages in Kafka is how we gain **query consistency**.\n5. Indexer shards take the documents and build the indices\n   - tokenizing to construct n-gram indices (for content, symbols) and other useful indices (languages, owners, etc) before serializing and flushing to disk when enough work as accumulated.\n6. Finally the shards run compaction to collapse up smaller indices to larger onces that are more efficient to query.\n   - Compaction also k-merges the posting list by score so relevant documents have lower IDs and will be returned first by lazy iterators.\n\nDuring initial ingest, we delay compact and do one big run at the end, but then as index keeps up with incremental changes, compaction is run on shorter intervals to handle things like document deletion.\n\n## Life of a query\n\nRedis is used to **manage quotas** and **cache some access control data**.\n\n1. front end accepts user query and passes it to query service\n2. service parses query into abstract syntax tree and rewrites it\n   - resolves languages to canonical [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) language ID (determine what langauge it is)\n   - tags extra clauses for permissions and scopes\n3. Fan out and send n concurrent request\n   - query must be sent to each shard in search cluster due to sharding strategy\n4. Conversion of query to lookup information in indices\n   - regex gets translated into a series of substring queries on ngram indices\n   - [trigrams](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) are sweet spot in design space, but causes problems at scale. GitHub uses \"sparse grams\", a dynamic gram size.\n5. Iterators from each clause are run (and = intersect; or = union)\n   - returns a list of documents\n   - double check each document before scoring, sorting, and returning requested number of results\n6. Aggregate results from all shards\n   - resort by score, filter, return top 100\n7. Github.com front-end does syntax highlighting, term highlighting, pagination.\n\n```ruby\nand(\n  owners_iter(\"rails\"),\n  languages_iter(326),\n  or(\n    and(\n      content_grams_iter(\"arg\"),\n      content_grams_iter(\"rgu\"),\n      content_grams_iter(\"gum\"),\n      or(\n        and(\n         content_grams_iter(\"ume\"),\n         content_grams_iter(\"ment\")\n        )\n        content_grams_iter(\"uments\"),\n      )\n    ),\n    or(paths_grams_iter…)\n    or(symbols_grams_iter…)\n  ),\n  …\n)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is the entire system.\n\nThe ingest pipeline can publish 120k docs/s, so working through 15.5b should take 36 hours.\n\nDelta indexing reduces no of documents we have to crawl by 50%, allowing us to re-index entire corpus in 18 hours.\n\nWe started with 115 TB of content to search, deduplication and delta indexing brings that down to 28 TB of unique content. The index itself clocks in at 25 TB, which includes all the indices, and a compressed copy of all unique content.\n\n## Concept review\n\n- forward and inverted index: indices for for full-text search\n- [content addressable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage?useskin=vector): fetching something based on content.\n- [sharding](https://planetscale.com/blog/how-does-database-sharding-work): splitting large data across multiple clusters to scale horizontally\n- git [blob](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects): blob (binary large object), named by a SHA-1 hashing of size and contents of file.\n- [delta encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding?useskin=vector): storing data in form of deltas, storing only the differences\n- [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree?useskin=vector): a subset of edges of a connected, edge-weighted, undirected graph that connects all vertices together **without cycles** and with **minimum possible total edge weight**.\n- [k-merges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm?useskin=vector): merging k sorted arrays to produce a single sorted\n- compaction: collapse smaller indices to larger ones\n- [bitmask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10493411/what-is-bit-masking): data used for bitwise operation\n- Probabilistic data structures: [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash?useskin=vector) and [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog?useskin=vector)\n- Serializing: convert object state to byte stream\n- Flushing: sync temporary state of data with permanent state.\n- abstract syntax tree: tree-like data structure that represents the structure of source code in a programming language\n","data":{"title":"How GitHub code search works","tags":"tech","date":"Aug 24, 2023"},"filePath":"code-search.md"},{"content":"\nIn 2021, a survey of over 1000 americans found that over 2/3 have eaten plant-based meat in the past year.\n\nBut are they actually better?\n\nLet's dig in.\n\n## 1.

For skilled players, Blackjack offers the best odds, potentially allowing professional players to win $1.50 to $3 per $100 from the casino.\n- Memorizing a basic strategy chart in Blackjack can minimize loss to around 60 cents per a hundred dollars.\n- Card counting in Blackjack involves tracking face cards and aces. More aces mean a higher chance of hitting blackjack, while more face cards increase the chance of the dealer busting.\n- The Martingale algorithm, which doubles your bet after every loss, is generally ineffective due to table limits.\n- In Craps, the follow-on bets offer even odds, allowing prolonged play without losing money.\n- In Poker, the best strategy is to be highly skilled and play against less skilled players with a lot of money to lose.\n- Roulette is generally impossible to win consistently due to the casino's edge, though some older casinos with unbalanced wheels could have exploitable biases.\n\n**Casino Policies and Technology:**\n\n- Casinos tend not to kick players out for winning, banking on the law of large numbers for eventual profit. However, if a player is identified as a professional with an edge, the casino can eject them using trespassing laws.\n- In New Jersey, casinos can't kick players out but can ruin the game for them by putting the cut cards at the front, making card counting impossible.\n- Casinos may use RFID embedded chips to track player betting and identify anomalies, possibly flagging certain players for observation.\n\n**Psychology and Gambling:**\n\n- The thrill of winning often outweighs the pain of losing for true gamblers, driving them to continue gambling.\n\n**Slot Machines:**\n\n- Slot machines are labor-efficient and major revenue generators for the casino, with adjustable odds ranging from 80% to 99% payout.\n- Progressive slot machines increase the potential payout as players lose, with optimal play possible when the bank is above a certain level.\n\n**Monte Carlo Simulation and Statistical Concepts:**\n\n- Each game has a different edge calculated through Monte Carlo simulations, where millions of hands are simulated to calculate expected wins or losses.\n- The concepts of expected value and the law of large numbers underpin casino games' outcomes, with every hand being independent, illustrating the \"hot hand fallacy.\"\n- Splitting aces and eights in Blackjack provides higher winning odds according to Monte Carlo simulations.\n","data":{"title":"Casino Odds","tags":"facts","date":"Jun 24, 2023"},"filePath":"casino-facts.md"},{"content":"\nWent to my second intern party today in Palo Alto.\n\nWe got in super early at 8:30 p.m. (party was set to start at 8).\n\nWe started playing beer pong, which I'm weirdly good at.\n\nI was a lot more comfortable at this party.\n\nI proactively reached out to people.\n\nI was better at prompting them, being curious about people, and being more relaxed.\n\nI was able to crack some jokes too, and was more natural.\n\nAt one point some friends wanted to dance, dancing still feels awkward, I don't know what to do with my hands.\n\nI met an Armenian guy from Canada and we had a lot of shared interest.\n\nWe talked about startups we want to work for, the work visa situation, and about graduate school.\n\nHe shared a vegan food startup called Climax Foods, which uses AI for food protein.\n\nIt made me realize that there are many companies outside of big tech that is doing interesting stuff, and it could be something that I enjoy and can bring meaning.\n\nI like this part about parties the most, there's so many people there that there's bound to be one person where there's a spark in the conversation.\n\nA good rule of thumb is if you feel like talking to someone, just do it.\n\nIt might lead to something meaningful, a new friendship, a new idea, a new life course.\n\nNo one remembers what you said anyways after a party, and they're probably drunk, so just go for it.\n","data":{"title":"Second Party experience","tags":"journal, talking","date":"Jun 23, 2023"},"filePath":"party2.md"},{"content":"\nThe right question at the right time can change the course of a life, still a turbulent mind, or heal an angry heart.\n\nHere are [12 questions](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/09/12-questions-that-will-change-your-life) that should be asked many times over the course of your life, or even throughout the day.\n\n> 1.

A high quality team is 2-4 smart people who know each other well, have at least 1 technical founder, and are all serious about doing a startup.\n- **Startups are not a thinking game, they are a doing game**.\n  - If you don't have good startup ideas now, the way to get better ones isn't to think really hard, it's to build stuff and launch it and learn from what happens.\n  - Building and launching your own products, end-to-end, is especially important experience to have. **Building software at large companies means tweaking features of large existing products. That's a very different skill from launching your own stuff**.\n- Do it **first thing after you graduate**\n  - Why? You don't have to quit anything to do a startup when you graduate. And if it doesn't work out, it just becomes your first job.\n  - dropping out should be an edge case. only do it if you're not liking school or your project takes off.\n  - working for a few years first has a downside: it'll be harder to convince your college friends then, they'll have settled into their job or moved.\n- Startups >>> big tech\n  - choose a startup; you'll learn more relevant skills, pick up startup culture, and meet other people who are more interested in startups.\n  - more ex-Stripe founders were funded than ex-Google founders in recent YC batch, despite the fact that Google has 27 times as many employees as Stripe.\n- Apply for YC\n  - How much traction?

That's 1.3 billion tons of food that either never leaves the farm, gets lost or spoiled during distribution, or are thrown away.\n\nFood waste is an environmental issue too.\n\nWasting food = wasting energy and water it took to grow, harvest, transport, and package.\n\nAnd food that goes to landfill produces methane when it rots.\n\n6-8% of human-caused greenhouse gas can be reduced if food waste is stopped.\n\nIn the US, 32.6 million cars worth of GG emission is generated from food waste.\n","data":{"title":"Food Waste","tags":"climate, food","date":"Jun 7, 2023"},"filePath":"foodwaste.md"},{"content":"\n> People change in four seasons: when they hurt enough they have to, when they see enough they are inspired to, when they learn enough that they want to, and when they receive enough that they are able to. - John C.

These days I'm thinking hard about who I can get lunch with.\n\nHowever, with change comes new opportunity for growth and for meeting new people. Since I no longer have the same friends that I stick with, I'm forced to go out of my comfort zone and talk to strangers.\n\nThis week, I got to meet some interns from the SWE team at the cafe, and had lunch with an intern on my team.

I looked at his phone, it was worn out at the edges. Do I start with, \"Hey what happened to your phone?\" What if that's too personal I thought, would it come off personal or too out-of-the-blue? I then looked at his shoes. No nothing to ask there it was regular boots. What if I directly ask what team he belongs to? No that's way to early in a conversation with a stranger to bring up.\n\nI thought about it for so long that eventually the shuttle came.\n\nIn my mind I'm thinking, because of my overthinking, I missed the opportunity to network with this person, who could've fed me a new piece of information, or connected me with another person, both of which could've changed the course of my life.\n\nI went in the shuttle, want to the very last row, and sat beside a chinese guy in his mid 20s.\n\nI've seen him before at the office.\n\nSo for 30 seconds, I sat down thinking whether I should tell him directly. I can feel my heart racing. A clock ticking down.\n\nI was thinking, \"Gosh is it too late to say it now, I've already sat down for so long, it's going to be awkward\"\n\nThen, I just decided to take the plunge.\n\n\"Hey, I think I've seen you at the office before\"\n\nHe goes \"Yea, I think so too\", and says he's at the first floor.\n\nWe start talking about the team we work for, I mentioned I was a returning intern. He started going on about how Tesla is a good company that can bring lots of opportunities, about how his friends got to other companies with Tesla on their resume.\n\nWe both connected when we shared the same frustration for the IT department, and how messy things are.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I found out his name was Ben too, like me. We both were animated and exchanged contacts.\n\nI left the shuttle smiling.\n\nI love the moments where you can connect with another person, when both parties have something to relate to, and surprising little moments like having the same name.\n\nI aim to focus less on the anxiety of the infinite amount of possibilities from talking to strangers, and more on the opportunity of making genuine connections.\n\nHopefully by the end of the summer, I'll be more comfortable with serendipitous conversations with strangers.\n","data":{"title":"Talking to Strangers","tags":"journal, talking","date":"May 19, 2023"},"filePath":"strangers.md"},{"content":"\nI came back to my airbnb after walking 30 minutes from a bus stop and saw a car parked out.\n\nSomeone must be moving in I thought, I was intrigued yet dreaded to find out who it was.\n\nTo my surprise it was a middle age lady in one of the empty rooms taking pictures.\n\nIt was the airbnb host.\n\nShe had a kind smile, and spoke english with an accent.\n\nShe asked where I stayed and I told her upstairs, A3.

(not common to see a property that returns complex data structures)\n\nThere's more to properties, you can make attributes read only by adding an underscore in front of variables to hide them, and create properties for them.\n\nThere's also property setters and deleters, which let's you directly assign attributes and to clean up other attributes that are auxiliary to the main property attribute.\n\nAlso @property apparently isn't a decorator, but a [descriptor](https://tushar.lol/post/descriptors/), which lets you customize the behavior getter/setter/deleter methods.\n\nThat's all for today.\n","data":{"title":"@property in Python","tags":"python","date":"May 16, 2023"},"filePath":"property.md"},{"content":"\nIt was my second time trying out golfing at Top Golf today.\n\nI hit ~80 shots, and only a handful were good.\n\nTowards the end, my hands were starting to sore and all my shots were bad.\n\nYou need a firm grip and a stable swing, and I don't think my arms are strong enough, my golf club kept moving around.\n\nI also think I'm not tall enough. I was using the hybrid club and had to hold it in an awkward position, and it kept hitting my arm.\n\n_Update: It's the day after I wrote this and arms and shoulders are sore and my grip is weak._\n\nSome good tips I got for golfing are:\n\n- don't look where the ball goes as you're hitting it\n- bend your knees, loosen your shoulders and relax, I found taking a breath before each shot helped\n- bend your club towards where you want to hit, it helps direct the shot\n- don't charge for the shot at the start and hit like an axe, it should be a single circular motion that flows like water\n- focus on your grip and stance, then work on other things\n- focus on hitting the bottom of the ball\n\nHere's what each club does in golf\n\n## Woods\n\n> 1W - your main driver...typical loft is 9 degrees up to 15. These used to be actual wood, but now are getting more bulky, and are all metal.\n>\n> 3W - your fairway driver...hard club to master. Used for long par 4s or par 5 second shots.\n>\n> 5W - lofted to around 16-19 degrees. Can be used in the rough, hits a little shorter than > your 3W, and has a more shallow swingplane.\n\n## Hybrids\n\n> These are clubs that will look and feel like a hybrid between an iron and wood. They have no cavity back (empty back like an iron), but stand straighter up at address and have more loft. Hybrids have the same lofts as many of the irons, but give more consistency, strength, and ease of hitting the ball in the air than their iron counterpart. They are popular for hitting out of rough because of their ability to slide into the ball and not catch the grass behind the ball (this causes a flyer or a ball hit further than needed with little spin because the grass covers the grooves). They are also popular for seniors or women, but not exclusively. Kind of cool clubs and relatively new.\n\n## Irons\n\n> 1 - nobody can hit this. Not even God. Don't know why I'm even including it.\n>\n> 2-4 - your long irons. Shallow face, not as much loft. You can hit these farther, and with > less backspin. They are typically used for distances on the fairway, anywhere from 180-240 to the green.\n>\n> 5-8 - your mid irons. More loft, used to hit from 130-180 yards out from the green.

You cast it and catch 80 fishes out of the 100. That's 80% recall. However, you also catch 80 rocks in the process, that's 50% precision.\n\nYou can use a smaller net, and target a pocket of the lake with only fish and no rocks, but you only get 20 of the fish, but no rocks. That's 20% recall and 100% precision.\n\nGet the idea?\n\nRecall = what proportion of the things you catch are actually fish (true). (ex1: 80 / 100)\n\nPrecision = of those you catch, what proportion are fish. (ex1: 80 / 80 + 80)\n\nTo balance between these two metrics, we optimize the [F1 score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score), which is their [harmonic mean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harmonic_mean).\n\nHowever, in some cases, precision would be more important than recall, and vice versa.\n\nHere's where the [F Beta](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score#F%CE%B2_score) scofe comes in handy.\n\nWe can adjust the value of Beta to assign higher weight to either precision or recall.\n\nBelow is a [toy example](https://github.com/MenaWANG/ML_toy_examples/blob/main/modeling%20algorithm/metrics-fbeta.ipynb).\n\n```py\nfrom sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score\n\n# define two models\ny_true           = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # half positive\ny_pred_precision = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # perfect precision, two false negatives\ny_pred_recall    = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] # perfect recall, three false positives\n\nperfect_precision = [y_true, y_pred_precision]\nperfect_recall    = [y_true, y_pred_recall]\n\n# the two models score similarly when beta = 1\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=1))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=1))\n\n# higher perfect precision scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=0.5))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=0.5))\n\n# higher perfect recall scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=2))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=2))\n\n```\n\nThe [beta parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) determines the weight of recall in the combined score.\n\nbeta < 1 lends more weight to precision, while beta > 1 favors recall (beta -> 0 considers only precision, beta -> +inf only recall).\n","data":{"title":"F-beta score","tags":"ML","date":"May 14, 2023"},"filePath":"fbeta.md"},{"content":"\nI flew from Iowa to San Jose today.\n\nWith time on my hands, and the state of flow that being on a plane induces, I finally got around to my queue on [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) and read a couple of interesting articles which I'm going to list here.\n\nThere are a lot of great ideas here, especially the ones under life and career.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler\n\nSome notes on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qKv5TBaOA) on essential coding topics to help me become a better programmer.\n\n## #1 Not using programming standards\n\nThere are [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) to follow in writing code such as whitespacing, file structure, and naming to make code consistent and readable.\n\nIt's especially important when working with other people, as it allows everyone to rely on shared expectations.\n\nNot keeping standards is like switching fonts all the time, you can still read it but the differences can throw people off.\n\n## #2 Not learning programming principles\n\nProgramming [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles) guide you into becoming a better programmer. They're like raw philosophies of code.\n\n[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is an acronym for five design principles intended to make OOP more maintainable.\n\n- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle\n  - aim to break code down into modules of one responsibility each, it's more code, but you can test it more cleanly and use parts of it elsewhere\n- **O**pen/Closed Principle\n  - design modules to be able to add new functionality in the future without making changes to them, extending but never modify directly\n- **L**iskov Substitution Principle\n  - only extend modules when it's still the same type at heart, if not, create its own type\n- **I**nterface Segregation Principle\n  - modules shouldn't need to know about functionality they don't use, split modules into smaller abstractions like interfaces, is useful when testing as it allows us to mock out only the functionality that each module needs\n- **D**ependency Inversion Principle\n  - code should communicate with each other abstractly through interfaces, allows for swapping parts of code\n\nCombining these principles ends up decoupling your code, which gives you modules that are independent of each other, making code maintainable, reusable, scalable and testable.\n\n## #3 Not using programming design patterns\n\n[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) give real solution to code problems, but they aren't fixed implementations.\n\nThey're used to architect software solutions, matching the right shapes to fit the needs our software has.\n\nTHere are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_type) main types\n\n1. Creational patterns - make and control new object instances i.e. factory pattern\n2. Structural patterns - how we organize and manipulate objects i.e. adapter pattern\n3. Behavioral Patterns - how code functions and how it communicates with other parts of the code, i.e. observer pattern.\n\nThese patterns are used in big corporations, and creates a universal vocabulary of programming.\n\n## #4 Bad naming\n\nBad variable naming makes code hard to interpret.\n\nHere are some fixes\n\n1. Avoid encoding - remove type information in variable\n2. Expand abbreviation - expand to full name to avoid miscommunication\n3. Use clear distinction - use names that more accurately represent nuances in code\n4. Replace \"magic\" values - define as named constants, clarifies significance and keeps things in sync if used elsewhere\n5. Be descriptive with names - find balance between clear enough without being verbose\n\n## #5 Not testing code\n\nWriting test can be difficult when code is not properly architected.\n\nAt the high level, there's end-to-end testing, which lets you test code as the end user.\n\nAny spaghetti code can be e2e tested since it doesn't really touch the code, but only what it delivers. It's also more tricky to setup since it requires a fully functional application running.\n\nAt the lower-level are unit tests that verify the operations of modules in isolation, and integration test that examines how modules interact with each other.\n\nApplying SOLID principles makes testing easier.\n\n## #6 Bad time management\n\nTime estimation is hard.\n\nRule of thumb is to 2x or 3x initial time estimate for a task.\n\nAccount for unknown problems along the way.\n\nRemember that creation goes hand-in-hand in problems.\n\nIt's better to overestimate schedule than underestimate it.\n\n## #7 Rushing\n\nThings can feel great when blazing through projects, there's a place for that in prototypes.\n\nBut if this is a long-term project, take your time and think things through from day-one.\n\nIt can give a better foundation to work from and avoid code debt.\n\nOvertime, you'll be saving time from batting decisions with no easy fix because of poor architecture.\n","data":{"title":"7 Deadly Sins of Programming","tags":"programming","date":"May 12, 2023"},"filePath":"sins.md"},{"content":"\nI had a 30-min chat today with [Stefan Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanmai/), who's been at Amazon and Meta for 10 years.\n\nHere are some questions I asked and his response (poorly paraphrased from what I can recall).\n\n**How to pivot from data analytics to SWE?**\n\n> Frame your resume, tell the right stories. If you collected data, built pipelines, build a product, shipped something, write it all down in your resume.\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out? What do you look for when you hire?**\n\n> A lot of candidates look the same in coding tests. We look more at what they do outside of class, open source projects. There are some people who just have the love for building something, creating products that makes then stand out. These are the people that have deep knowledge about a certain thing, and having a conversation with them you can get signals that they've done a lot of shit.\n\n**What are some common mistakes candidates make?**\n\n> Nerves during interviews. Giving up on a problem at 0, and not trying to solve till 50% or 80%. Not asking edge cases when starting out in interview, which brings up a lot of issues later in your code. Advice is to just take a deep breath before each question. Calm down.\n\n**Were there key decisions or actions you took early in your career that contributed most to your success?**\n\n> It was small changes that eventually led me to where I am. I started out in consulting doing SWE, and I wanted to get into ML. I wanted to get into big tech to learn from great people. Just be sure rate of learning is positive. The industry is fast-paced and you have to be learning constantly.\n\n**Thoughts on Gen AI and how it impacts career?**\n\n> in every hype cycle of AI and ML people make a lot of predictions about what's going to happen, but things end up being the same. Things are definitely going to be different, it's going to be like the internet boom where a lot of business started making websites, APIs, etc. it'll happen with Gen AI as well. For ML, there's less focus on the data acquisition and training models, more on fine-tuning. For SWE, CRUD apps in webdev are going to go away, you can build basic websites with english now, although there are complexities with web dev now. So focus on the fundamentals and just pursue what you're interested in.\n\n**Culture difference in Amazon vs Meta?**\n\n> Amazon operates on a small margin, and it's very process-based. They're focused on how to optimize and improve their operations and processes. It also has a hierarchy where each team is siloed and you don't get access to what other teams are doing. They do have an annual ML conference where it's like academia, they have posters presenting their research. Meta operates on a high margin, they have more money to burn on new things. It's also very unstructured, you won't find documentation for something you need, so you'll be going across teams to get answers. Meta also values emotional intelligence. It's a big company, so experience is very team dependent.\n\n**What would you tell your younger self before starting a company?**\n\n> To start sooner. I wanted to start a company when I was your age, and wanted to get some experience from big tech. For some time I thought I didn't have enough experience yet or wasn't a good enough leader to start my own company. But now I believe 2-3 years is enough at a big tech and it can teach almost everything you need to know to found your own company. But working at big tech for so long did give me the financial ability to pursue my ventures now.\n\nSome mistakes:\n\n- felt intimidating talking to him right off the bat, I could tell he was really intelligent and articulate, everything he said was dense and rich in information.\n- I felt like I was asking really cliche and basic questions, and was thinking about better questions to ask midway, which made me lose focus about he was saying.\n- I was saying \"that's a good answer/point\", \"thank you for the insights\", but had nothing to respond back to or add on to what he said. I was also optimizing to ask as many questions as possible, but I need a less awkward way to respond back.\n- I was not confident in asking questions, I was hesitant and incoherent instead of being direct and clear.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n- Treat coffee chats as a conversation with a friend.\n- I should follow up on their response so I can latch on to something, give it time to digest and form structure.\n- I should do more research and ask questions that are high-value and specific to the person, my questions were too generic.\n\nI found this collection of interviews with ML practitioners on [ApplyingML](https://applyingml.com/mentors/) with some good questions and might be using some of these for my future coffee chats.\n","data":{"title":"Coffee chat with Stefan Mai","tags":"AI","date":"May 11, 2023"},"filePath":"stefan.md"},{"content":"\nFinished my finals today and thought about dumping some thoughts on exams.\n\nIn Malaysia, there's this big test at the end of senior year of high school that everyone (in the national curriculum) takes before entering college. It's called [Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijil_Pelajaran_Malaysia) (SPM), or the Malaysian Certificate of Education.\n\nI took 10 subjects in the examination, and I remember the insane amount of effort that went into it. Our teachers for each course would provide past year papers with the answers, and our objective was to complete all of them.\n\nI had fun doing them, but it was a complete waste of time and energy. Instead of learning a useful skill, I was learning how to solve for x, without thinking **why** I had to solve for x in the first place.\n\nI did the exams, I got straight As, but what did I achieve? Was I just supposed to be this machine that was fed all that information and dump it all out?\n\nNow that I'm in university, I still feel that way about exams. But with more appreciation about both the good and bad of exams.\n\nWhat I like about exams:\n\n- studying with friends, going through something difficult together bonds us\n- a good way to make new friends, sharing practice questions, teaching them\n- teaches you how to consume and compress a lot of information in a short time\n- tests your understanding, but dependent on how much effort and care the lecture puts into making the questions\n- exam feels like a search problem, where the potential questions are a subset of the possible information covered in the course, also feels game theory like where you try to predict what kind of questions would the professor test us on.\n- as I take higher level classes, my exams has overlapping concepts, and I start to realize how the puzzle pieces connect together.\n\nWhat I don't like about exams:\n\n- doing well gives me false idea of knowing the content. I can get an A in the class but still not be able to **really** understand what's going on\n- puts me on a number line, directly comparing me with others, getting bad grades makes me feel like a failure.\n- anxiety-inducing and high pressure, my parents are paying a lot of money take courses as an international student, so I'm pressured to do well.\n- you're working in a vacuum and forced to work with what you have in your head, without any access to resources, which is unrealistic in the real-world.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n- I forget a lot from my previous classes because I don't apply information I've learned\n- I don't understand a class because I didn't seek to understand it in the first place, necessity is the impetus for learning, and I could never connect the information in my classes to something I can practically use at the time I was learning it.\n- I overthink a lot in exams, and when I overthink, I tend to change my mind about answers that were already correct, so I should pay attention to my first intuitions more.\n- the belief that you're not good at something is powerful, my inner thoughts when I face a problem I can't solve is \"I don't know this\", \"I'm screwed\", and it makes me give up really fast, clouds my judgement, and turns an easy problem into a complex one.\n","data":{"title":"On exams","tags":"journal","date":"May 10, 2023"},"filePath":"exams.md"},{"content":"\n> In Bayesian statistics, model parameters are random variables.\n\nI took a [Bayesian statistics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayesian_statistics) course this semester and I think it'll be the most valuable course I'll ever be taking in my 4 year of undergraduate studies in Statistics at ISU.\n\nThere's a decay rate for knowledge that I retain for the classes I take, and it'll be the same for this course as well. But if there's one thing I want to take away from this course, it's the mindset of being a Bayesian\n\nI came across this [article](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/bayesian-inference-from-first-principles) by Christoph Molnar, and what better way to end the chapter of this course by understanding Bayesian modelling from first principles.\n\nThe first principles view of Bayesian statistics is that model parameters are [random variables](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Random_variable).\n\nThe model here can be a simple distribution, and the parameters - the mean of a distribution, coefficients in linear regression, the correlation coefficient - are variables with their own distributions.\n\nThis notion contrasts the frequentist view of treating parameters as fixed but unknown quantities. By treating them as random variables, we acknowledge the uncertainty around their true values.\n\nWe're also, later on, able to incorporate our beliefs since we assign [probability distributions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Probability_distribution) to these parameters.\n\nSo, we've established parameters are variables.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish in Bayesian modelling?\n\nWe start with data about an event, and we want to estimate a parameter of interest (θ). This parameter can be anything from effectiveness of a drug to the click-through rate on a website.\n\nIn mathematical form, our model is estimating P(θ|X), the parameter distribution for θ given the data X.\n\nBut we can't directly estimate P(θ|X), we don't know the true values of parameters in the real-word.\n\nIt's much more natural to estimate the inverse - P(X|θ) the distribution of data given parameters.\n\nAnd here's where [Bayes' theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayes'_theorem) come into the picture.\n\nThis theorem inverse the condition to P(X|θ), a.k.a the [likelihood function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Likelihood_function).\n\nFrom this theorem, we are given two things: P(θ), the prior distribution and P(X), the evidence.\n\nP(θ) is your beliefs about the world. You have to specify this BEFORE observing the data.\n\nThis prior can be informative or non-informative, and that determines how much your belief will influence the estimation. A non-informative prior means the data has more influence, and vice versa.\n\nIn statistics jargon, the posterior mean is the weighted average between the prior mean and the sample mean.\n\nThe cool thing being Bayesian is once you get an estimation P(θ|X), with the power of sequential updating, that becomes your new prior.\n\nThis idea of updating your priors is very intuitive, we're collecting new data and updating our beliefs from our interactions and experiences in everyday life.\n\nBayes' theorem also involves the term P(X) called the evidence, which is usually unfeasible to estimate. It's also known as the normalizing constant.\n\nSo instead we take the numerator P(X|θ) P(θ), which is proportional to the posterior distribution.\n\nIn most cases, the posterior distribution is not a known distribution like the Normal or Binomial distribution, so we need to perform sampling from the posterior using techniques such as [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo?useskin=vector).\n\nThere's no use to knowing all this without being able to apply it. So my goal is read [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) and learn [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) to put this knowledge into practice.\n","data":{"title":"A Bayesian mindset","tags":"statistics","date":"May 9, 2023"},"filePath":"bayesian.md"},{"content":"\n> Luke 1:1–4 (NIV): Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\n\nIn the New Testaments, we have four [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\n\nAll of them tell the same story about the life of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus).\n\nThough the four books have many similarities, each author presents a unique perspective on Jesus, emphasizing a different theme for an intended audience.\n\n**Matthew** wrote mainly for Jews, emphasizing that Jesus, the son of David, was the Messiah for whom they were waiting. That’s why he began with a genealogy and includes multiple references to Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Jesus.\n\n**Mark** emphasizes Jesus as the Suffering Servant of God. This was especially relevant to believers in Jesus who were suffering for their faith.\n\n**Luke** was written to Theophilus, a gentile.

I think I'll enjoy it a lot. The craft and detail that goes into taking each shot, and the adventure in choosing the right camera and roll of film.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4Yn16Rw8s) and got to learn a little but more about film photography.\n\nFirst, **how does film work**?\n\nThe basic idea is that film is a roll of plastic containing a magical mix of chemicals that make it sensitive to light.\n\nWhen film is placed into the camera, it lives in complete darkness.\n\nEvery time you shoot a photo, you let light in through the lense. That light then hits the film, and burns it in a way that shapes and color are reflected on the material.\n\nThe second question is **which camera** to choose.\n\nThere are 3 main types of film cameras:\n\n1. SLR (single-lens reflex camera)\n   - what you see on the viewfinder is very close to the image (thanks to mirror)\n   - option to change lenses and shoot manually\n   - bulkier and heavier\n   - who? action photography\n2. Rangefinder\n   - a different type of viewfinder that has framelines that assist you when shooting\n   - not all of them allow you to change the lens (the ones that do are more expensive)\n   - compact, smaller setup\n   - who? street photography\n3. Point & shoot\n   - automatic cameras, no need to set exposure or focus (depending on camera)\n   - require batteries\n   - who? easily capture moments of everyday life (first two requires precision and time)\n\nWhen choosing a **type of film**, there are two variables: style and price.\n\nAnd these films differ in color and contrast.\n\nFor beginners, go with Kodak GOLD 200 (cheapish color film)\n\nNow for **how to shoot**.\n\nWhen shooting film, exposure matters.\n\nOpposite from digital shooting, details in film are harder to recover from the shadows and easier from highlights. So, it's important to expose correctly or slightly overexposed, which means using a light meter.\n","data":{"title":"Film photography 101","tags":"photography","date":"May 7, 2023"},"filePath":"film.md"},{"content":"\n> In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.\n\nI had a practice session today for Sunday's praise and worship, and in one of the songs, the lead singer requested a key change.\n\nKey changes mess up my flow, because I memorize a certain routine to minimize mistakes while playing.\n\nIt was just a simple one-step key change, from C to B-flat, so I could still manage.\n\nI was looking at every chord in the old key on my printed sheet music, and then translating it to the new key in real time.\n\nBut at one point, my visual stimuli of seeing the C chord won over my brain's background process that was telling my hands to play B-flat, causing me to hit the wrong chords.\n\nI thought about why that happens and it turns out I was experiencing the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).\n\nYou've probably experienced this effect yourself in a certain brain teaser.\n\nKnown as the Stroop test, you're given a list of words that are printed in a different color than the meaning of the word. And your task is to name the color of the word, not the word itself, as fast as you can.\n\nFor example, when presented with the word \"[Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw)\", it's easier to say red, as opposed to the color of the text (blue).\n\nThere are some [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Theories) used to explain why this effect happens.\n\nThey're all based on the idea that our brains processes relevant and irrelevant information in parallel, but they both \"race\" to your brain's central processor to be chosen as a response.\n\nThis neurophysiological test has different [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Variations), and can reveal a lot about your brain and how it processes information.\n\nAmong the most important uses is in measuring a person's [selective attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27437-001) capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.\n\nIt can also diagnose different psychiatric and neurological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that studying this effect might help us better understand the black box that is our brain, which can allow us to overcome our fast instinctual thinking, known as System 1 in the book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow?useskin=vector), helping us reach to more logical conclusions.\n","data":{"title":"Stroop effect","tags":"ideas, neuroscience","date":"May 6, 2023"},"filePath":"stroop.md"},{"content":"\nI used to squeeze my to-do list with a lot of tasks, I felt I should spend every minute of my day efficiently.

And for P3 tasks, save them for when your energy levels are at its lowest, since you can perform them on autopilot mode.\n","data":{"title":"Three things","tags":"productivity","date":"May 5, 2023"},"filePath":"3.md"},{"content":"\nI like listening the [Huberman lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) podcast.\n\nAndrew is really good at distilling research and studies into small bits of practical advice.\n\nThe two biggest lessons I've garnered from his podcast are to get [sunlight](https://youtu.be/WDv4AWk0J3U?t=299) exposure in the morning for ~5 minutes, and [physiological sigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc) is effective in reducing anxiety and stress.\n\nIn his [episode](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/) on goal setting and achieving goals, he shares 8 science-backed strategies.\n\nThey can be broken down into three main categories:\n\n1. **Goal Setting:** how do we set the right goals?\n   - **The 85% Rule** — you should set your goals so that you achieve them [85.13%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4) of the time (failing 15% of the time despite your best efforts)\n   - **Make A Plan** — set SMART goals, create a specific set of action steps that get right down to details about what success would look like.\n   - **Imagine The Worst** — write down/talk about how bad it will be if you don't achieve your goals, it’s motivating to think about what it will be like if you fail.\n2. **Goal Execution:** how do actually do the actions required to achieve our goals?\n   - **Outsmart Your Obstacles** — identify potential obstacles ahead of time and then planning out how to defeat them (foreshadow failure).\n   - **Procrastinate with Other Tasks** — pre-task multitasking before a work session can actually help you generate adrenaline and get you into action.\n   - **Focus Your Eyes to Focus Your Mind** — Focus your visual attention on a single point for 30-60 seconds, it increases levels of systolic blood pressure and adrenaline.\n3. **Goal Persistence:** how do we stick with our goals?\n   - **Have A Weekly Check In** — review the progress you’ve made on your goals once a week, “dopamine milestone” — a pit stop where you signal to your brain that things are moving forward.\n   - **Reward Your Effort** — the next time you make an effort on something important — take note, and then take pride.

Deconstruct the skill\n2. Learn enough to self-correct\n3. Remove practice barriers\n4. Practice at least 20 hours.\n\n**First**, decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done.\n\nIs it coding your own personal portfolio in React & Next.js? Building blazingly fast app using Rust? Creating a compiler from scratch? Be specific.\n\nSkills are just big bundles of other skills. Look into the skills you need to achieve it and deconstruct; break it down into smaller pieces.\n\nThe more you break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide what parts of the skills that will actually get you to what you want. Then practice those first.\n\nTo practice, you need reliable sources. Do some research, find 3-5 best resources. Don't use this as a way to procrastinate. Figure out the optimal stopping time for exploration, then start exploiting.\n\n**Second**, you don't have learn everything. You only need to learn enough to the point where you can practice, and self-correct as you practice.\n\nLearning is getting better at noticing when you're making a mistake, and doing something a little different every time.\n\nIn programming, that means having the ability to debug and fix errors in your code. It also means spotting opportunities to make your code more optimized.\n\n**Third**, life is full of distractions and the internet is full of noise. They get into the way of practicing.\n\nDevote time to learning. Block time out on your calendar. Set a timer and start working. Get into the flow with some music. Turn off notifications on your phone. Set website blockers.\n\n**Fourth**, we don't like to feel stupid. And when learning anything new, there's an initial frustration barrier.\n\nCommit to practicing. Learn in public. Get a study buddy. Write about what you learn.

I was at NCUR 23' and this dude had insane energy talking about his research, I could feel his energy pulsating from him. I could feel his high lingering on me afterwards.\n\nSecond, emotion travels faster than rational thought. And when we experience big changes (layoffs, breakups, death), 5 signal emotions of change arise: fear, frustration, anger, anxiety, and grief.\n\nFirst law of thermodynamics tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Rather it can be transferred, transformed, or conserved. Let's apply this to emotional energy.\n\nConverting energy means bottling it all up inside, which then manifests in stress and burnout. Transferring energy is venting out to a friend. The problem with this is you're just moving energy around from one person to another.\n\nThe power comes in transforming energy, turning signal emotions into positive ones. You can take anxiety and turn it into anticipation, fear into motivation, grief into growth, all of which becomes fuel for growth and action.\n\nHow can you do this? You need self-awareness to know these negative emotions exist, then acknowledge it, and then choosing to transform them.\n\nThat means treating your mental state like a garden. A good gardener tends to their garden, and that means doing things like self-reflection, meditation, and journalling.\n\nThey know what's festering and what needs nurturing. That means remove negative thoughts from your mind like weeds from soil. And nurturing the positive emotions, so you can reap the crop, and be who you want to be.\n","data":{"title":"The Physics of Emotions","tags":"emotions, physics","date":"Apr 20, 2023"},"filePath":"emotion-physics.md"},{"content":"\n> When you face hardship, remember that the thing itself is no misfortune at all.

We're all vulnerable and actively seeking for belonging and connection (being in a completely new place), and at the same time, willing to do anything fun and exciting (since we were in California).\n\nI'm going back this summer, and a part of me fears it will never be the same again, that I won't meet the same people I did last year.\n\nBut I know it's foolish because it all comes down to my own intentions in making new friends, stepping outside my comfort zone, and actively seeking new experiences.\n\nEven though it's going to be tiring as an introvert, it's going to be worth it.\n\nFuture me if you're reading this, stop thinking so much and just do it.\n","data":{"title":"Friendships in California","tags":"journal, friends","date":"Apr 18, 2023"},"filePath":"making-friends.md"},{"content":"\nFound this [article](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/91-of-ml-perfomance-degrade-in-time) by NannyML and thought it would be useful for my article writing.\n\nML models depend on the data it was trained on. Since data in the real-world changes over time, model performance will degrade as time passes, a phenomenon the authors called \"AI Aging\".\n\nMIT, Harvard, and other top institutions trained 4 different ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network) on 32 datasets from four industries (Healthcare, Weather, Airport Traffic, and Financial) and found that [91% of their ML models degrade over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15245-z)\n\nKey takeaway\n\n> Neither the data nor the model alone can be used to guarantee consistent predictive quality. Instead, the temporal model quality is determined by the stability of a specific model applied to the specific data at a particular time.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nThe right solution is context-dependent, and investigation should be done to understand the cause of the degradation\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1. Alert when model must be retrained: need access to latest ground truth or able to estimate model performance\n2. develop efficient and robust mechanism for automatic model retraining: (if no data quality issue or concept drift), retraining model on latest labeled data can help\n3. Have constant access to most recent ground truth: allows retraining, but in practice, ground truth is often delayed, expensive and time-consuming to newly labeled data. Alternative is to have a model catalog and use estimated performance to select best performing model\n\nMore:\n\n- https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html\n- https://www.nannyml.com/blog/6-ways-to-address-data-distribution-shift\n","data":{"title":"AI Aging","tags":"ML, mlops","date":"Apr 17, 2023"},"filePath":"ai-aging.md"},{"content":"\nWorking on this blog was hard, next.js and tailwindcss isn't easy lol.\n\nMy plan is to write something every day like I used to on https://github.com/benthecoder/til\n\nLet's see how it goes.\n","data":{"title":"Day One","tags":"writing","date":"Apr 16, 2023"},"filePath":"day-one.md"}]
