Create an End-to-end pipeline\n\n- Create a very simple pipeline of reading in data, creating features, training a (simple) model, and computing the **competition-specific metric**\n- replicate as closely as possible to the [validation](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-kaggle-book/9781801817479/Text/Chapter_6.xhtml#_idParaDest-95) setup for leaderboard\n\n### 2. Experiment and research\n\n- start with a simple model and iterate through many ideas\n- read research papers, check other comps\n- look at data, even external data, reduce noise, augment the data\n- use different losses\n- post-process the predictions\n- more experimentation = better, evaluate them with validation setup\n\n### 3. Scale your approach\n\n- now you've converged on a final model, and are no longer experimenting\n- it's time to use all of the data and \"scale up\" the model\n- this means hyperparameter turning, using a deeper model, etc.\n- happens at the last 2-3 weeks of comp\n\n### Summary\n\n> Pick something that motivates you.

This is why [code reviews](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html#complexity) are needed, to check if the code causes too much cognitive load.\n\nSo, be kind to your coworkers and write clean code.\n\nThe key to reducing cognitive load is to make code simpler.\n\nHere are some principles:\n\n1. **Limit amount of code in a function or file**: [Keep functions small](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FunctionLength.html) and limit each class to [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle).\n2. **Create abstractions to hide implementation details**: functions and interfaces are [abstraction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs211/2006sp/Lectures/L08-Abstraction/08_abstraction.html) to hide complex details, but don't go overboard.\n3. **Simplify control flow**: too many if statements or loops makes the [control flow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/simplify-your-control-flows.html) hard to understand, hide complex logic with helper functions. Reduce [nesting](https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/06/code-health-reduce-nesting-reduce.html) with early returns.\n4. **Minimize mutable state**: [stateless](https://stackoverflow.com/a/844548) code is easier to understand, avoid mutable class fields, make types [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)\n5. **Include only relevant details in a test**: test can be [hard to follow](https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/include-only-relevant-details-in-tests.html) if it includes boilerplate test data that is irrelevant\n6. **Don't overuse mocks in tests**: [improper use of mocks](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/05/testing-on-toilet-dont-overuse-mocks.html) -> cluttered test with calls that expose implementation details\n\nHere's a [printer friendly version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgcBG2iOmzEWIKYs6hNDyTMZ-an0SOwmJZRsX898XD0/edit?pli=1).\n","data":{"title":"Clean Code - Google","tags":"programming","date":"Nov 9, 2023"},"filePath":"clean-code.md"},{"content":"\nSoftware engineers do more than just coding.\n\nThe difference between a developer and a great developer is the **breadth and depth** of their approach in **delivering value**.\n\nHere are [8 habits](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/habits-of-great-software-engineers/) of great SWEs.\n\n1. **Focusing beyond the code**: how does the code interact with other components? scaling? maintainability?\n2. **Efficiency** / Antifragility: Making sure everything around you runs smoothly and has forward momentum\n3. **Joy of tinkering**: build projects, try out frameworks, build stuff on the side. Keeps the spark alive.\n4. **Knowing the why**: dig deep into why your code does what it does, too many abstractions nowadays that rarely someone thinks below the level of their language e.g JS devs not thinking about the engine that runs their code.\n5. **Thinking in systems**: knowing how your code impacts not only your individual system but other parts of the business/application/life.\n6. **Tech detox**: Recharging away from your monitor makes you a better programmer.\n7. **The art of approximation**: Knowing important tech numbers to approximate calculations when making decisions when programming.

We are aware of our names, our parents, and the milestones of our lives, such as our successes and failures. However, truly grasping our self-concept extends well beyond the mere facts of our personal history.\n\nSelf-concept is deeply intertwined with our self-esteem. It reflects in our belief in our capabilities to overcome challenges, to contribute positively to our world, and in our capacity for self-transformation. These aspects of self-concept are influenced by personal history, but according to Dr. Paul Conti, an individual can enhance their **agency** and ability to achieve goals through a deeper understanding of their self-concept.\n\n### How do we achieve this deeper understanding?\n\nOne effective method is to consciously and deliberately construct a [life narrative](https://youtu.be/CJIXbibQ0jI?si=mtY8J3gJ91xo_4Nb&t=5214).\n\n### What is a Life Narrative?\n\nThe process involves dividing your life into 3-5 year segments. Within these periods, note down in bullet points the life events that seem significant to you. This could encompass hobbies, work experiences, pivotal relationships, personal challenges, or anything else that stands out in your memory. These events could be either positive or negative, or even neutral experiences that continue to resonate with you.\n\n### What to include?\n\nIt's crucial to include moments that you fear you might forget, moments that you believe define you. The aim isn't to draft a seamless life story, but to create a collage of vital personal experiences.\n\n### Developing a Historical Sense of Self\n\nBy documenting these life segments, you cultivate a historical sense of self, which contributes to your understanding of your past, present, and potentially, your future. This historical sense grounds you in the flow of time and reveals the extent of your commitment to various pursuits at different stages of your life.\n\n### Recognizing Patterns\n\nThis narrative can illuminate persistent patterns in your work or relationships, helping you discern whether these patterns are beneficial. It's not about setting goals; it's about discerning a structured pattern in your narrative.\n\n### Am I on the right path?\n\nBy reviewing your life narrative, you can evaluate if you're on the course you desire. It helps you understand the journey that has led you to where you are today.\n","data":{"title":"Life Narrative","tags":"psychology","date":"Nov 7, 2023"},"filePath":"self-concept.md"},{"content":"\n[Kalman Filters](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kalman_filter) helps estimate unknown values based on a series of measurements taken over time.\n\nYou can use it in any place where you have uncertain information about some dynamic system, and you can make an educated guess about what the system is going to do next.\n\nSo, a common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly airfract, [spacecraft](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19860003843/downloads/19860003843.pdf) and ships [positioned dynamically](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dynamic_positioning).\n\nEven if reality is messy and interferes with the clean motion, it can still do a good job of figuring out what happened.\n\nThis is because it can combine information, taking advantage of correlations between different phenomena you maybe wouldn't have thought to exploit.\n\nIt's ideal for systems that are continuously changing, and are memory efficient (only keeps track of previous state), making them fast and suited for real time and embedded systems.\n\nHere are some examples\n\n- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Improving the accuracy of object tracking and camera positioning, ensuring that virtual overlays maintain correct alignment with the real world in AR applications.\n- **Behavioral Economics**: Analyzing decision-making processes by filtering out noise from experimental data, providing insights into how people make economic choices under uncertainty.\n- **Earthquake Prediction Models**: Enhancing the precision of models that predict seismic activity by processing noisy seismographic data over time.\n- **Professional Sports**: Applying advanced analytics to player tracking data in real time to strategize on team movements and improve training regimens.\n- **Film Production**: Stabilizing camera motion in movies, allowing for smoother shots and easier integration of special effects in post-production.\n- **Artwork Analysis and Restoration**: Assisting art conservators by filtering through layers of paint and varnish using imaging technology to uncover original strokes and colors or to understand the deterioration patterns.\n\n## Resources\n\nUnderstanding\n\n- [Poor Man's Explanation of Kalman Filtering: Or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Matrix Inversion](https://archive.org/details/poor-mans-explanation-of-kalman-filtering)\n- [Kalman Filter Tutorial](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx)\n- [Greg Czerniak's Website -

More machine learning fundamentals interviews (things like logistic regression, probability fundamentals, vector calculus, and math puzzles).\n- The **robotics engineer** interviews: fun systems questions. extremely specific to robotics, less time talking about ML or RL.\n\n### Most common questions\n\n- What do you want to work on when you show up? Who do you want to work with? If you had unlimited compute what would you work on?\n- What was a past project you worked on? What was the impact? What did you learn?\n- What styles of communication do you prefer? Do you work in teams? Do you value mentorship?\n\n## Actionable Tips\n\n- **Coding Practice**: Consistent coding practice, such as using LeetCode premium.\n- **ML Background Interviews**: While tricky, preparing for \"ML Background\" interviews (math tricks and basic ML tradeoffs) through coursework study can be advantageous.\n- **Job Talk Preparation**: Emphasize a strong narrative and vision in your job talk, focusing less on technical detail and more on **engaging storytelling**.\n- **Research Agenda**: Clearly outlining a research agenda with timelines and goals can clarify your process and intentions for starting new projects.\n- **Saying No**: Be willing to decline unreasonable demands from companies; most are flexible and aim for a positive candidate experience.\n- **Interview Topics**: Inquire about interview preparation topics; recruiters might provide specific areas to focus on, such as programming concepts or problem-solving domains.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [AI Paygrades](https://aipaygrad.es/)\n- [2023 ML/AI Researcher Salary Report: Insights and Strategies for Successful Negotiation](https://www.teamrora.com/post/ai-researchers-salary-negotiation-report-2023)\n- [The last reliable (available) path into AI](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/path-into-ai)\n- [The AI research job market sh\\*t show (and my experience)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/ai-research-job-market)\n- [Behind the curtain: what it feels like to work in AI right now (April 2023)](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/behind-the-curtain-ai)\n","data":{"title":"Job Hunt as a PhD in AI","tags":"AI, work","date":"Nov 3, 2023"},"filePath":"ai-jobs.md"},{"content":"\nCatboost is an open-source ML [Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting?useskin=vector) Boosted Decision [Trees](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/decision-forests/intro-to-gbdt) algorithm, it's name come from the terms “Category” and “Boosting.” It was developed by Yandex (Russian Google ) in 2017\n\nKey [attributes](https://neptune.ai/blog/when-to-choose-catboost-over-xgboost-or-lightgbm) of Catboost:\n\n- ranking objective function\n- native categorical features preprocessing\n- model analysis\n- fastest prediction time\n  - [30-60x](https://www.joinplank.com/articles/xgboost-catboost-lightgbm) faster as documented by real companies\n  - on GPUs it is 50-100x times faster than XGBoost.\n- performs remarkably well with default parameters, significantly improving performance when tuned\n- utilising ideas such as Ordered Target Statistics from online learning, CatBoost considers datasets sequential in time and permutes them\n  - By creating the concept of artificial time 🕰️ CatBoost cleverly reduces Prediction Shift, inherent in the traditional Gradient Boosting models such as XGBoost and LightGBM.\n- 8X faster inference than XGBoost\n  - build better trees 🌲 that result in better regularisation and speed, especially during inference\n\n## References\n\n- [The Gradient Boosters V: CatBoost – Deep & Shallow](https://deep-and-shallow.com/2020/02/29/the-gradient-boosters-v-catboost/)\n- [XGBoost?

We both dreamt of working at FAANG companies in the US, and share the same passion starting a company until today. I still remember the first orientation day, I went into this big hall filled with rows upon rows of students fresh out of high school, each with their own unique passions and dreams. I remember feeling anxious and alone until I saw a familiar face in one of the seats at the back.\n\nW convinced me to join the American University Program Club as committees, and I'm grateful he did. All of us in the committee became good friends. We took classes together, had lunch together at various places in SS15, and crammed for exams together at the one-floor library. We would go out for movies, have kbbq buffet together, celebrate birthdays at the mall. I remember spending a lot of my time in the freezing computer room at the library, writing medium articles and doing assignments. I remember stay late till 9 p.m. making decorations and preparing for our Halloween event.\n\nThen in 2020, COVID hit and the familiar faces became pixelated and their voices became digital. I never had to take a 1.5 hour train ride every day to campus anymore, but not being able to be around them anymore in person was sad.\n\nNow, we're all split and we don't really keep in touch anymore, but it was a point in my life where I was healthy, and I will always remember it fondly.\n\nI took a gap semester after finishing up all my units at INTI in **Summer 2020**, and I spent my time completing online courses on R and Machine Learning and reading fiction books. I enjoyed the time with my family at home. I did a lot of home workouts, I went out for jogs, I could spend the entire day just reading a book, and I was able to pursue what I was interested in. I distinctly remember reading a few pages of Crime and Punishment every night at 12 a.m. before bed in the living room, eating digestive biscuits with hot soy milk, sucked into the compelling world of Russian literature. I barely had any social interactions with people other that my family, but as an introvert, that worked out well.\n\nThen, **Jan 2021** came, and to say my life changed is an understatement. My life was struck by a disease that slowly ate away my health, physically and mentally. I went through physical turmoil, psychological torture, and experienced utter helplessness in search for a cure to the suffering.\n\nWhat I initially thought was just a minor issue with my body turned into an (now almost) 3 year fight against GERD.\n\nAfter the medicine from the first clinic didn't work, I went to a second clinic, and a hospital, and it was a slow realization, as I switched from one medicine to the next, that what I have is chronic.\n\nThe first big change was my sleep. I slept flat initially and was having burning sensations in my chest and breathing issues. I played the cover of \"Green Eyes\" and Okinawa by 92914 every night to sleep because I couldn't stand the pain. I found out that I had to sleep at an incline, and it's been that way since. You can imagine the discomfort of not being able to lie down flat, it's torture. It's like not being able to take in a deep breath, or an itch that you can never scratch. I envy people who lay flat on the ground at parks, can you imagine that?\n\nThe second biggest change was my diet. I slowly realized the amount of limitations placed on my diet as days turned into weeks, and into months. My two favorite things at that time: green tea and chocolate was out of my life from that day. Anything with pepper is off limits. I could no longer drink ice cold carbonated drinks on a hot day. I couldn't take sips of alcohol or eat mandarin oranges during Chinese New Years. No more fried chicken from Texas Chicken. No eating the crispy skin on roasted pork. And so much more. At that time, I lived on a diet of thin-noodle soup and fish paste which my mum made most days at home. It became my favorite food.\n\nThe third was my fitness. I couldn't exert my body the same way I could before. I no longer had the freedom to push myself physically, to go for jogs that made me feel alive and out of breath. All I could do was pedal the stationary bike in my house at a suitable pace. My body has been deteriorating since then. Aside from the occasional bicep curls that I can do, and that time I tried to lay down to do a bench. My body can no longer perform the way it used to.\n\nBasically, I could no longer do and eat 90% of the things I could before.\n\nI went through all this at that time, while taking midnight online classes in from ISU **Spring and Summer 2021**.\n\nMy friends never knew about my condition, and I spent most of my time home. It felt like I was battling this alone.\n\nI was switched several kinds of medications for months, and was recommended antidepressants to treat anxiety, because it's one of the triggers for GERD. Even though they relieved the symptoms, it was still creeping there. I was just never the same. I had to rely on these pills to keep me functioning, they literally reduce the amount of acid being produced in my stomach.\n\nI'm grateful for the support I have from my family to help me deal with the disease. I thought about how much worse it would be if I had this disease, but not have caring parents or the financial capabilities to seek health care.\n\nIn **August 2021**, it was time for me to fly to the US.\n\nMy best friend decided to stay in Malaysia, while I fly to the US with two of my other friends and my sister. When I first arrived, it felt nice. I've been stuck in my home for more than a year, and now I'm in a new environment with new people. I remember orientation where groups were formed, names were exchanged, and dozens booths with free stuff, the grass and the sun. I felt more free, even though I was still trapped in this body.\n\nI wasn't very socially adept, and I spent a lot of my time with the friends that I came here with.\n\nLiving with J was stressful, and only nice 20% of the time. Maybe some of his actions shaped me the way I am today, but I believe you can help people improve without making them feel bad about themselves. Denigrating others and placing that much unnecessary pressure on someone is not right.\n\nI had my first interview from the career fair, and then my second interview got pulled because I wasn't a citizen. From then on, I realized how hard it is for international students. I started fervently applying online in hopes of getting lucky. I did a lot of one-sided interviews, and continued with interviews as I was back Malaysia during winter. I don't remember much about what I did in Malaysia but it probably involved seeing doctors.\n\nAs I got back to the US in **Spring 2022**, I was told I got the offer for one of the companies. They wanted me to start asap. But because of the \"no working in the first two semester of arriving in the US restriction\" for F1 students, I couldn't take the offer. It was really defeating.\n\nMy health also got bad to the point where I had to get a medical reduced course load because I could not swallow food at all. I also found it hard to breathe. I arrived for a week and I already wanted to go back home.Eventually, medicine got me back on my feet for the time being. And it was during this time when I fell in love with hackathons. I did them back to back on weekends, and I loved the thrill.\n\nThe highlight of 2022 was my Tesla internship in **Summer 2022**. A big part of who I am and what I want today stems from the experiences I had and the people I met in the bay area. Even though I didn't like the work I did the most, being in California expanded my horizons. The world felt really small in Ames, IA. In California, I felt like it was what I was missing the whole time. I felt like I belonged. I had dozens of new experiences and made some of my closest friends during that time, albeit I did had to take PPIs the entire time to sustain myself, it made me feel like I could still live a life with GERD.\n\nIn **Fall 2022**, I was living in a new apartment. My sister helped move us out of that prison over the summer and she had to face the attacks and rage of J. It significantly improved my living conditions and it's something I should be more grateful about.\n\nI grew really depressed at this time. I felt like I was trapped in Iowa and wanted to go back to California. I realized how little this place could offer me. There's no where I can go besides the library to do my work. It's the same restaurants with sub-par food. And I couldn't fill my time with gym or any kinds of sports. I began to resent Iowa. I missed not being able to go for trips to the beach, or take the train to SF chinatown, or just be around my friends. I felt like coming to ISU was a bad decision. I should've had more agency, instead of applying here because my friends were doing it too.\n\nI started another round of internship hunt, in hopes of getting a better position in California. I stopped my medication and my condition worsened. I also started to develop really bad skin conditions (genetical) that felt like another punishment on top of GERD, and it was a lot to bear. This skin condition made me fear sugar and foods with high GI index. My food options was constrained even further. You can imagine how hard it is to avoid sugar in the US. Everything I buy in grocery stores, I look at the \"Total Sugar\" amount.\n\nI've never had confidence with my smile, because it's been crooked since I was in high school and I've dying to get it straightened till this day. And this skin condition just made it worse. I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt like I'll never be able to be with someone. That I was a deformed and unlovable. It was really hard to internalize why this was happening to me. GERD is very likely genetical, and this skin condition as well. Ever since these two disease started to consume my life, my relationship with my parents were challenged. It's really easy to blame others for genetical diseases, even though they had no part in causing it, I just have no where else to direct it too. Face time calls with my mom always revolves around the issues with my body and nothing else. I don't want her to feel bad or worried, with me being so far away, but I just can't help it. I can't fake being ok, cause I'm not.\n\nThis condition also made me get really paranoid about sweating. So all this just felt like everything was getting worse. It feels like it's going downhill ever since 2021 and I notice a pattern of issues just arising in my body.\n\nFinals were done and the early internship hunt was not a success. After the semester ended, I visited Tokyo (it was really fun) and went back to Malaysia in the winter.\n\nWhen people talk about going home, they talk about all the food they get to eat, the friends they could see again, and the health checkups to make sure they're prepared for the lack of health support in the US.\n\nWhen I went back, it was largely about dealing with my stomach and skin conditions. I had to meet with a Korean doctor with an Oriental medicine background every week. My skin condition was serious. It was weekly sessions of just delivering pure and raw pain and psychological turmoil. I was being tortured for something I couldn't control. I already had a condition that has no cure (without surgery), and with this on top of it, it just felt like I was cursed. It felt like God hated me. I did another GERD scope, which the conclusion was basically I developed a Type I hernia from doing situps and I just have to deal with that with strong medicine and lifestyle changes. Not very helpful if you ask me.\n\nI did get to eat some of the food I enjoyed, got to see my friend group from college. One month passes by really quick.\n\nI came back to the US and endured the cold, freezing weather of Iowa again, and started **Spring 2023**. The cold aggravates my symptoms, it squeezes my core. I can't wear clothing that's too tight cause of my skin condition. I felt broken.\n\nI started attending a Chinese church at this time, and they provided a lot of support. The elderly people were super kind and caring, it felt like home. I stopped going church in 2022 because the bigger churches felt so lonely, and the disease was really shaking my faith. It was hard to accept that God would place this on me. It's easy to say suffering builds tolerance, and it makes you stronger, and you will come out of this a better person. But I'm going through all this right now, living it day by day, at this very second, it's still there. When will it end?\n\nMy skin conditions came back in March and I had to take antibiotics. I went through a lot of discomfort. I hated my body. Eventually the antibiotics helped and things started to look better. My colleague reached out to me and asked if I wanted to go back to the team for the summer. I failed Glassdoor's 3-round interview, so going back was the only option.\n\n**Summer 23**. It was really nice to be back. I got to see old friends and make new ones. I went for a lot of AI events and hackathons, it felt unreal being in the same room with CEOs and YC founders, sitting at the same table with stanford Ph.D. students, and staying up all night at the ferry building in San Francisco for my app to be presented and awarded. I went to my first american party (and another one later on), although it was more like a networking event since everyone were interns. My parents came to visit for 3 weeks and it was nice driving them around to touristy spots, and eat good food. They liked it a lot, especially since I was paying for everything. I felt like an adult for the first time. It was 14 weeks filled with adventure, thrill, and lots of networking. I'm a little more confident in speaking now, although still trying to be less awkward. During this time, I got back on PPIs cause it started to flare up, but the in-house Tesla doctors told me to stop taking them, because my bones will break easier due to the side effects of long term PPIs. I was worried. So I switched to something else that was less effective, but less harmful. I eventually stopped taking them when I felt better.\n\nLeaving California again was hard. My old friends came back full time, and I felt like I was delaying my life. I also had only one more class to graduate, and I was contemplating a lot about coming back to Iowa. But now I'm glad I did. I was really burnt out in California, and never took the time to rest.\n\n**Fall 2023**. The first few weeks being back was hard, I felt really bored. Not because I didn't have anything to do, but because what used to be 8 hours of work, and then outings and events after work hours and in the weekends turned into 2 hours of classes a week.\n\nI got a chance to visit Toronto in September for the Airflow summit. It was my first all-paid-for conference and it was fun to say the least. I got to meet two of my friends from last summer. We caught up with dim-sum and hotpot, and I'm glad I got to see them again, and hope to in the future. I walked around UofT, saw a protest, and got to meet interesting people.\n\nLately I've been busy applying to grad school with my best friend from college. He never got to come to the US and now I'm hoping we go to the same grad school and work on our company together. I've been doing hackathons again, writing articles, working on side projects. Having more time on my hands is a curse and a blessing. A lot of the work is intrinsically motivated.\n\nI don't see my friends as often anymore cause we don't take the same classes. We just celebrated one of their birthdays and it's nice to be able to sit down and have dinner with them. It almost feels bittersweet. 2 years passed by quickly. I start to remember all the dinners we had together, the assignments we worked on, and the discord calls. I don't know where each of us will be next year.\n\nMy skin condition came back this month, and it killed me. I had a lot of breakdowns this semester. I would sit on the carpeted floor in my bedroom just spiralling and tearing up.\n\nIt hurts in the shower, so I blast worship music and sing in the bathroom to deal with the pain. I feel anger, sadness, disgust all at the same time. I've spent days crying in the bathroom saying I can't take this anymore.\n\nIt's scary to not feel comfortable with seeking healthcare as an international student because of the cost. Apparently I was dealing with my condition using the wrong methods (which seemed right at that time), and it was making it worse. Now I'm left with bandages and ointments and antibiotics every day, in hopes of a fast recovery for my Boston trip.\n\nSo that brings me to **today**.\n\nI had a good birthday celebration. I spent it with people I love and care about. I got wishes from my close friends, and it made me realize how blessed it is to have them in my life. And how much I appreciate them being in my life.\n\nThe past 2 years of my life has been revolving around these issues, these rules that helps avoid triggering these diseases, and it's still hard for me to accept it.\n\nI stopped medication a while now, but my symptoms come and go, the most frequent one being the heartburns that induces asthma like symptoms and the stabbing pain in my lower-left abdomen. And the occasional sore throat and ulcers at the back of my tongue. I wake up feeling horrible, and never well rested, and I can never figure out if it's because of my conditions.\n\nI'm terrified that this is my life now and I hate this life. I'll never be able to life like a normal person. I won't get the chance to be drunk at parties. To bar hop with friends late night in NYC. To just be able to try out new foods and desserts without worrying about whether it is worth the risk of utter pain and maybe cancer or my skin condition developing. To backpack across europe and go on crazy hikes. Doing fun and dumb things that a young person in his 20s get to do. To get married and have kids. To just be.\n\nMy mom keeps telling me to focus on what I still can do, and it's not a lot. I try to see a silver lining, but it's suffocating to be in this body. Most days I can distract myself with writing, coding side projects, with good kpop music, but at the end of it all, I'm still sick. When it's quiet and I'm alone with my thoughts, I'm consumed with fear.\n\nI was asked what did I learn from this condition that I have today. Here's my attempt at answering that.\n\nI learned that my faith wasn't as strong as I thought. It's easy to believe in God when things are going well. But when you're struck down with diseases and your health is stolen away from you, like Job, can you still sustain? Will you hold strong in believing, with no guarantee that things will be better? Right now I'm still battling with this.\n\nI learned that in tough times, it's so easy to spiral in circles and not see a way out. It feels like everything is closing in and this is everything, and it's forever, that it won't change. With issues that takes time to heal, where progress is not immediate, it's hard to visualize that things do get better. Under duress, my brain focuses on the current too much. I've found that talking to people helps, and I'm the kind that would rather suffer in silence than ask for help so it's been challenging. Or talking in the third person, and rationalizing through the situation and repeating \"It's going to be ok\" and \"This is not forever\"\n\nI learned that there are issues that people are facing that you can't see. People see me and think I'm healthy and fine, and I'm not. I'm disabled. So it's better to be kind to everyone, even when I'm in pain, I try to make other people's lives better. I'm still selfish at times, especially with my family, and that's something I'm working on.\n\nI learned that gratitude is essential to deal with big life issues, and might be the precursor to radical acceptance. If I was more grateful with what I do have in my life, if I'm around people I love, these issues fade away. It used to be all there is, it clouded my thoughts, but through gratitude, it becomes smaller.\n\nI'm going back Malaysia after graduating to hopefully fix most of my health issues.\n\nI suffered through the whole ISU experience in hopes of achieving the FAANG dream, and if not that, I could've went back to Tesla. It would be a nice life still. But I can't.\n\nHere's hoping that in the midst of suffering and despair, I see a way out of it.\n\nPeople say I sound dead and tired, and I honestly don't know whether I was like this all the time, or the accumulation of suffering over years that rendered me like this. People say suffering builds strength, but it seems to just be making me worn out and tired. Maybe I'm just not strong enough. I find it hard to garner up the energy to do things nowadays. I'm just tired of everything.\n\nI thought a lot about how to continue living a meaningful life in the face of trials and tribulations. How to live when you're limited in so many ways and life seems to be working against you. When things that used to provide joy are off-limits. When a basic need like health, something a lot of people take granted for, is not met. And there's little you can do about it besides medicine, where you suffer the side effects later on in life. A life time of medicine.\n\nBut who knows. Maybe I'm just overthinking things and being emotional as a 22 year old who's never faced big life challenges until this happened to me.\n\nI know life is never fair, and life is suffering. And I like to believe that God only places as much suffering in your life as you can bear. He also places people in your life to help you get through them. So far, I feel less alone.\n\nMaybe I live with this disease for the rest of my life, but I adapt and it could still be meaningful.\n\nOr maybe years into the future, I'm healthy again, looking back at my life in my early 20s and remember only the good parts.\n","data":{"title":"Turning 22","tags":"personal, journal","date":"Oct 28, 2023"},"filePath":"22.md"},{"content":"\nSix [skills](https://levelupsoftwareengineering.substack.com/p/6-skills-required-to-be-a-senior) one should develop to grow into senior+ SWE positions.\n\n1.

And have access to the file system to see file changes.\n\nThe idea could be to have a landing page to serve as the ground truth, the status of the project, issues being worked on, pain points, etc.\n\nI liked the idea of having an agent pull up relevant information in a chat while you're talking to someone. It's like having a personal assistant.\n\nDesigners have this vision of how the product should look like, the user experience, while developers just want to build it.\n\nThere's a lot of back and forth between the two, and it's hard to keep track of the changes. Requirements also change every week, so designs have to be updated.\n\nIt's interesting to think about how LLMs can fit into this workflow.\n\nI told him that I believe designers can be developers in the future, and it's easier for designers to code than developers to learn design, and he thought the exact opposite.\n\nLLMs are already being used internally in companies to help boost productivity and collaboration.\n\nIt's just a matter of time before your coworker(s) is a locally-hosted LLM model that you can talk to, instead of waiting for a response from another

data.\n\nMy process has been pasting snippets of the algorithm step by step, and prompting GPT 4 to generate high quality, pythonic code with documentation in the style of Google.\n\nIt worked well for the easy parts, but now I'm stuck on cropping the intersecting polygons.\n\nWith ChatGPT I've been taking a lot of mental shortcuts, and since I'm optimizing more on completing this project, rather than learning the ins and outs of geospatial python packages, I've been placing too much trust in ChatGPT.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts of hoping ChatGPT would correct itself, it seems like there's no way around it, it's time to go deep into the weeds of the package documentation.\n\nChatGPT has been great at documenting my code, and also writing some tests, but it's definitely not a replacement for geospatial code, especially since it's not that good at R in the first place, having it translate to Python might be too much to ask.\n\nMy takeaway from the article

baked into it.\n\nEven the [most copied snippet from SO has a bug](https://programming.guide/worlds-most-copied-so-snippet.html).\n\nOn the other hand, stealing code means you know exactly what it does.\n\nYou understand it at the fundamental level, the quirks, all of it seamlessly integrate into your own code, turning into something original.\n\nA good test is to see if you could write it

procrastination](https://www.structuredprocrastination.com/) by John Perry, a philosophy professor at Stanford.\n\nThe gist of it is you can **use procrastination to your advantage** to get other things done.\n\nYou have a list of tasks that you have to do, ordered by importance.\n\nThe tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top.\n\nBut there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down.\n\nBy doing those tasks, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen, acquiring the reputation for getting a lot done.\n\nThere is always something you have to do that you're putting off, and while you're procrastinating, just do lots of other stuff instead.\n\nThe trick here is to pick the right sort of projects for the top of the list.\n\nThe two characteristics of such tasks are:\n\n- (1) They seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't)\n- (2) They seem to be important (but really aren't)\n\nLuckily, life is abound with such tasks with unreal deadlines and inflated importance.\n\nTo execute structured procrastination, you need a certain a mount of self-deception.\n\nYou need to be able to recognize and commit to these \"decoy\" tasks, while making yourself feel they are important and urgent.\n","data":{"title":"Structured Procrastination","tags":"productivity, work","date":"Oct 19, 2023"},"filePath":"procrastination.md"},{"content":"\nPaul Graham wrote about

Compute **test statistic** that measures size of apparent effect. It could be a difference between two groups, absolute difference in means, see more examples [here](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/06/more-hypotheses-less-trivia.html). We call this test statistic 𝛿\n2. Define a **null hypothesis**, which is a model of the world under which the assumption that effect is not real, ex: if you think there is a difference between group A and B, H0 = there is no difference between A and B.\n3. Model of null hypothesis should be [stochastic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stochastic), that is, capable of simulating data similar to original data.\n4. Goal: compute p-value (probability of seeing an effect as big as 𝛿 under null hypothesis). You can estimate p-value using **simulation**: calculate the same test statistic you used on the actual data for each simulation.\n5. Count the fraction of times the test statistic exceeds 𝛿. This fraction approximates p-value. If it's sufficiently small, you can conclude that the apparent effect is [unlikely due to chance](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/05/hypothesis-testing-is-only-mostly.html).\n\n## Why simulation?\n\n- analytical methods are slow and expensive, but even as computation gets faster, they are appealing because they are\n  - **inflexible**: using a standard test -> particular test statistic and model, might not be appropriate for problem domain.\n  - **opaque**: real-world scenario has many possible models, based on different assumptions. In standard tests, assumptions are implicit, not easy to know whether model is appropriate.\n- simulation on the other hand, are\n  - **explicit**: creating a simulation forces you to think about your modeling decisions, the simulations themselves document those decisions.\n  - **arbitrarily flexible**: can try out several test statistics and models, can choose most appropriate one for the scenario.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Statistical Rethinking 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus) ([website](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/))\n- [Hypothesis testing - Think Stats 2e](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2010.html)\n","data":{"title":"Testing","tags":"statistics","date":"Oct 17, 2023"},"filePath":"testing.md"},{"content":"\nOn how to be a good codemate by [Brian Lee](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/codemates/).\n\nSome takeaways/interesting points:\n\n- It has everything to do with settings expectations on how you communicate and collaborate within a shared codebase, not your coding ability or quality\n- tell your teammates how to **test your workflow**, hook the script (unit test, integration test, or bash script) into CI so your codemates can't accidentally break you, [tests](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html#the_beyonceacutesemicolon_rule) are the only scalable way to inform your team on how to not break your code.\n- changes requiring manual steps need to be **announced publicly**, ex: updated dependency, changes in AWS account permissions. The pro move is to use tools that transparently and automatically install and use currently checked-in configs\n- effort in writing actual code is in equal parts of packaging code that satisfies all automated linters, test coverage requirements, links to tickets, and other blocking requirements\n- adopt mindset of investing in formatters that automatically fix formatting issues, than linters that nag you about issues\n- One common toe-stepping maneuver is refactoring - renaming modules, moving functions/classes around. Merge conflicts are inevitable\n- Refactoring benefits: compress mental map needed to understand how the codebase works.\n- Refactoring cost: people need to relearn their mental map, a needless refactor is like sorting a bookshelf by color - unnecessary and productivity killer\n- Two rules for refactoring: (1) **Don't Refactor**, get formatting and naming right the [first time](https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/noutils/), (2) **don't mix refactors with feature changes**, refactoring changes are 10-100x easier to review than normal feature-adding changes.

The cost of breaking main branch is equally expensive to suffer through worry-laden code review process.\n- Have a quick rollback procedure to mitigate accidental breakage.\n- The ultimate solution is to embrace [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), shard codebase along organizational lines, reduce O(n^2) cost of coordinating people's work\n","data":{"title":"Codemate","tags":"work, programming","date":"Oct 16, 2023"},"filePath":"codemate.md"},{"content":"\nFound this 22-minute [article](https://ncase.me/mental-health/) that's a mix of personal story, science of mental health, and practical tips.\n\nIt's also a \"companion piece\" for an interactive story game called \"[Adventures with Anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)\"\n\nHere is the [TL;DR](https://ncase.me/mental-health/#toc_18)\n\n- Do not fear fear itself\n- [Pain](https://ncase.me/mental-health/#toc_2) is a protector\n- Fear is a guard dog for your needs\n- **All feelings are imperfect [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_accounts_of_emotion) about met/unmet needs**\n- Our fundamental human needs are: physical needs, social needs, \"becoming a better person\" needs\n- **Healthy people don't \"cope\" with emotions, they collaborate with them.

More **state and federal incentives** to build an **infrastructure for collection** is needed.\n\n### challenges of recycling\n\nThe vast [majority](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/sustainability/how-is-plastic-recycled-a-step-by-step-guide-to-recycling.aspx) of \"recycling\" is grinding plastic, melting it, and re-forming it. This mechanical recycling well involves properly sorting and cleaning materials, which is time intensive and expensive.\n\nIt's also very [difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/)/impossible to recycle many types of plastic more than once without causing the material to acquire **defects and [contaminants](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/recycling-contamination/)** (many recycled materials contain high levels of unwanted toxins)\n\n### local policies for recycling\n\nLocal policies make a huge difference.\n\nMaine and Oregon invested in recycling programs, and up to 80% of bottles made from PET ([polyethylene terephthalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)) are recycled. In some states, such as in the South, that percentage is in the single digits.\n\nThe national average for these materials is 30%.\n\nSome states have policies that [hinder progress](https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/).\n\nIndustry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute [state-level laws](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation) that **prevent** bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags.\n\nOver a dozen states currently have [preemptive laws](https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/preemption/) on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics\n\n### Improving recycling\n\nOne, simplify and standardize process of plastic production. Currently more than 10,000 chemicals are used, and upward 3,200 have \"one or more [hazardous properties](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report) of concern\"\n\nSecond, find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials, instead of having to sort everything first. For example, [chemical process](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.2c00402) that can [transform several types of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/30/1063837/how-chemists-are-tackling-the-plastics-problem/) into propane, and using [soil bacterium](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4626) to break down plastics and re-form them to bioplastics.\n\nThird, using microbes that can break down and recycle [PET](https://www.americanbeverage.org/education-resources/blog/post/what-is-pet/). One company doing this is [Carbios](https://www.carbios.com/en/). A [microbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideonella_sakaiensis) discovered in Japan in 2016 was the first one identified that can live solely on plastic as a food source.\n\n### reducing demand\n\nTo solve the problem in the plastic pollution crisis, we must solve the root problem: _plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap_\n\nPolymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require **policy and behavioral changes** small and large.\n\nTiny changes can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution.\n\nExample: policymakers in Washington, DC instituted five-cent charge on plastic bags in 2010, and estimates show number of bags dropped by more than half in months, and quantity found in [local waterways dropped 30%-70%](https://gwhatchet.com/2018/02/07/district-tax-leads-to-sharp-decrease-in-plastic-bag-use/)\n\nA global [Extended Producer Responsibility](https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm) scheme would be an example of a major shift.\n\nChange will be difficult, but they can be instituted in a way that don't hurt businesses.\n\nCreating incentives for alternatives -> innovation and new jobs.\n","data":{"title":"Plastic is everywhere","tags":"climate","date":"Oct 12,

If he did not believe that one must live for something, he would not live.\n> — Leo Tolstoy, A Confession\n\nAnother great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDjrTkssZmE) by Horses on the topic of [Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death).\n\nHe reflects on thoughts of death and the works of [Leo Tolstoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy): \"The Confession\" and \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\".\n\nIn [_The Confession_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26244.A_Confession), he attempts to find the meaning of life on the examples of science, philosophy, eastern wisdom, and opinions of his fellow writers.\n\nTolstoy [concludes](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/06/03/tolstoy-confession/) that there are [four ways](https://www.swarthmorereview.com/posts/2-8-22-tolstoys-confession) to live in the face of death:\n\n1. **Ignorance**: Not think about the absurdity of existence, the problem is once start thinking about these things, you can never go back\n2. **Epicureanism**: Filling life with pleasure - drinking from an [endless supply of honey](https://www.bneo.xyz/posts/life-proverb) and ignoring the beast\n3. **Suicide**: One realizes the foolishness of existence, and have the willpower to end their lives\n4. **Acceptance of life** (by weakness): clings to life because of the lack of courage to end it all, so you accept it instead.\n\n[_The Death of Ivan Ilyich_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18386.The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilych) is a fantastic companion piece to _The Confession_, it talks about Ivan, a man who is brought face to face with his own mortality.\n\nI read this in my plane ride back to school from California, and getting a terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, to experience the agony and suffering of a man to be on the brink of death made me examine my life.\n\nIt made me reflect on what it means to truly live, to not be in my death bed and be filled with regrets about the way I lived my life.\n\nIt made me wonder the things I'm doing that fulfills the expectations of others, like how Ivan fell for the trappings of status, adoration, success.\n\nIt was depressing he felt so isolated in his deathbed, he was surrounded by the most shallow of people, even his wife, and just wanted someone to comfort and cry with him.\n\nAfter his death, people who went to his funeral did not mourn for Ivan, in fact, they selfishly thought about the promotions they would get, and even annoyed by the tasks they must perform. Broadly, they are filled with joy, that it is Ivan who died, not them\n\nThinking about death from time to time is a good practice. Memento mori. I hope to truly live, and to be surrounded with people I love, and leave this world in peace.\n\n> A life poorly lived only amplifies the horrors of death or create them entirely. So I believe the answer in death is not found in what happens after or during or even why we all must die, but instead in how we live.\n","data":{"title":"O, Death!","tags":"life, book","date":"Oct 4, 2023"},"filePath":"death.md"},{"content":"\n> “Best of all he loved the fall  \n> the leaves yellow on the cottonwoods  \n> leaves floating on the trout streams  \n> and above the hills the high blue windless skies ...  \n> now he will be a part of them forever.”\n\nI watched this beautifully animated video about [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC6HlwDWr0k) and his tortured life.\n\nI recently read \"The Sun Also Rises\" and it was great learning more about the man behind the prose.\n\nHis life is often portrayed as a hyper-masculine adventurer and womanizing chauvinist degenerate.\n\nBut there is a more profound story beyond the modern caricature.\n\nHis parents and generations of his family suffered from mental illness, and he was no exception.\n\nThere were six suicides in four generations.\n\nThroughout his life, he self-reported depressive episodes over and over.\n\nHe wrote to a friend: \"I felt that gigantic bloody emptiness and nothingness\".\n\nHe was a temperamental manic depressive that swung between megalomania and melancholy\n\nAfter his father's suicide he plunged into a life of daily drinking, and it is thought that his alcoholism permanently altered his brain chemistry.\n\nIn addition to the horrific mental issues that plagued him from birth, he suffered from a number of physical injuries - six traumatic brain injuries in total.\n\nSeeking mental health in the early 20th century was unthinkable, it would mean throwing away your masculinity.\n\nHis father's suicide cemented the idea that it was an option.\n\nHe wrote letters about suicide to his friends.\n\n> \"I understand for the first time how men can commit suicide.

Select the right mentor(s)\n\n- finding suitable mentors is a process of judgement and learning, there needs to be congruence between your goals and the skills and knowledge of the mentor\n- Find someone with content expertise, or influence in a field, who has a wide network of contacts\n- Someone in the top of their field isn't necessarily a good mentor, personal attributes (patience) and values (altruism) are fundamental to a good relationship. You should like, respect and trust your mentor.\n\n### 2. Be respectful of your mentor's time and manage it wisely\n\n- Be proactive in scheduling appointments, plan a regular slot\n- Plan for meetings by setting out agendas and prioritising discussion points\n- Include a timeline to schedule each item so the both of you focus on what is important\n- Propose solutions to help your mentor decide which answer may be best (\"managing up\")\n- request actions before meetings to help your mentor prepare \"Please review X so we can discuss at our meeting\"\n\n### 3. Communicate efficiently and effectively\n\n- begin with honest conversations regarding your goals and aspirations\n- include a written plan of short and long term goals, which helps share a vision of success with your mentor\n- Clarify roles and expectations on both sides to minimise conflict and disappointment.\n- establish regular cadence of communication that includes goals and progress towards them, for example: summary of current project status, including progress and problems, discussion of new projects, etc.\n- pay attention to your \"talking-to-listening ratio\", it should be less than one. You should be listening more than you are talking.\n- Send focused messages with brief background that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\" are ideal\n\n### 4. Be engaged, energising, and collaborative\n\n- avoid emotionally draining behaviours, such as complaining, pessimism, and \"snarking\" about others.\n- Show that you are mature and genuinely open to learning\n- be an energy donor, not an energy recipient\n- help drive projects forward, be proactive, and accept all comments as important learning opportunities\n- Be a \"closer\" : someone who follows through on tasks in timely fashion and at a high standard.\n- Be generous and honest in giving others credit, you're working with not just your mentor, but other colleagues and the wider scientific community.\n","data":{"title":"Golden Rules of Effective Menteeship","tags":"career, work","date":"Sep 24, 2023"},"filePath":"mentee.md"},{"content":"\n[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) (data build tool) is a CLT that enables data analyst and [engineers](https://www.getdbt.com/data-teams/hiring-data-engineer) to transform data in their [data warehouses](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/data-warehouse) more effectively.\n\n### where\n\ndbt is the T in [ETL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/etl).\n\nIt doesn't extract or load, but it sits on top of your warehouse and transforms data that's already loaded.\n\nThis is known as [ELT](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/elt).\n\nELT is becoming more prevalent because data warehouses like Bigquery and Snowflake are extremely performant and scalable, that transformations can be more effectively handed in-database rather than elsewhere.\n\n### What\n\nSo [what](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt) does it do?\n\nThe only function of dbt is to take code, compile it to SQL, and run it against your database.\n\nAt the most basic level, it's a compiler and a runner.\n\nYou write dbt code in a text editor of your choice, or the [IDE](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/dbt-cloud-ide/develop-in-the-cloud) in dbt cloud, and run dbt in the cli.\n\ndbt compiles all the code into raw sql, and execute it against a configured data warehouse.\n\ndbt code has two core workflows: **building** data [models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/models) and **testing** data models\n\n### building models\n\nA data model is any transformed [view](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/view) of raw data.\n\nTo create a model, you write a SQL SELECT statement. dbt then builds it in the database, materializing it as a view or [table](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/table).\n\nThis model then can be queried by other models or analytical tools.\n\n[Materialization](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/materializations) means the strategy ([DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl)) by which a data model is built in the warehouse. Or in other words, the manner in which data is represented.\n\n### testing\n\nYou can [test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/tests) the integrity of SQL in each model by making assertions.\n\nYou can test for things like:\n\n- whether a specificed column only has non-null or unique\n- values that have a corresponding value in another model\n- values from a list\n- custom tests that suit business logic\n\nThere are two ways to define a test: singular and generic.\n\nSingular tests is test in its simplest form. You write a SQL query that returns failing rows, save it in a .sql file in your test directory.\n\nGeneric tests are parameterized queries that accept arguments. they can be reused over and over, and are defined in a test block.\n\nThey're defined in a .yml file in `models` directory\n\nOut of the box, dbt ships with four generic tests already defined: unique, not_null, accepted_values and relationships.\n\n### dbt code\n\nWhat is dbt code exactly?\n\nit's a combination of SQL and Jinja, a common templating language used in Python.\n\nFor example, `ref()` is a function that gives users the ability to reference other models in their code.\n\nref does two things: interpolates itself into raw SQL as the appropriate schema.table, and it automatically builds [DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dag) of all the models in a project.\n\nWith Jinja, you can do if statements, loops, macros, and gives SQL superpowers.\n\n### modular code\n\ndbt also has additional functions and variables, where you can express logic that checks if code is running in dev vs prod, state of database. etc.\n\nThis allows you to write modular code that can automate complicated and time-consuming tasks.\n\nThis means dbt gives users powerful tools to build, ship and share their own transformations.\n\nWhich is why dbt ships with a package manager.\n\nSo to summarize everything, here's why dbt is so [powerful](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction):\n\n- avoid writing boilerplate [DML](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dml) and [DDL](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/ddl), just write SELECT statements and dbt takes cares of materialization\n- build reusable, modular data models that can be referenced\n- reduce the time it takes for queries to run with metadata\n- Use Jinja in SQL for control structures, macros, hooks\n- Publish packages that can be referenced by otherse\n- Use source control processes like branching, PRs\n- Write data quality tests quickly and easily\n- [document](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation) descriptions for each model and field\n- snapshots your data to track changes or reconstruct historic values\n","data":{"title":"What is dbt?","tags":"tech, explained","date":"Sep 23, 2023"},"filePath":"dbt.md"},{"content":"\n> Do the most important things first in the day and don’t let anybody stop you.

The hours from 7 to 12 are your time to build for the future before the world descends on you.\n\nIn economics, a [discount rate](https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/discounting-101/) is used to assess the present value of future benefits, with a higher rate devaluing distant gains.\n\nA zero discount rate refers to the idea of not diminishing the value of future benefits when assessing the importance of tasks. It emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their true significance and long-term impact, without devaluing them due to the time it takes to achieve those benefits.\n\nCowen [suggests](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/09/do-i-wish-to-revise-my-time-management-tips.html) using a \"zero discount rate\" to evaluate tasks.

And it was only $1 per ride.\n\nToronto is such a diverse city, a quick scan of the crowd, I can find people of different ethnicity.\n\nI got off at Bay St, and walked towards the Marriott.\n\nBreakfast was croissants, I sat down beside the guy I held the door for into the hotel.\n\nHe went to Oregon State, and works at AWS. He came to the US the same year I was born.\n\nWe went into the main hall, and the summit kicked off.\n\nI wrote notes, and started gathering potential people I could message for a job. The talks were at the big hall till 11 a.m.\n\nAfter that the sessions were split into 4 ballrooms.\n\nIn between were breaks, I went to each sponsor booth and had a good chat with the people there, and got nice swags.

He's worked multiple companies, including Apple, and is now at a startup in Texas. He's a head of data, and likes that he can take ownership of the data stack.\n\nI left the Marriott 6:30 p.m. and went to the BMV bookstore.

I went in and ordered 6 beef meatballs and a $1 hot dog on the screens. I saw the packaged almond cake in the freezer, and was reminded of eating it back in Malaysia.\n\nIt was close to 8, I travelled back to the Eaten Centre Mall.\n\nI arrived at Yonge-Dundas Square, and took some pictures. It's like a mini times square.\n\nI went into UNIQLO first thing to buy a t-shirt.\n\nThen I went underground and got pocket hand sanitizers at BABW. The handpicked apple scent was nice.\n\nI got hungry and went in search for food.\n\nI came across a sushi store, with a big sale sign. The lady mentioned it was buy one get one free, I did some quick filtering to look for what I could eat, and I only saw two boxes of cali roll.

I don't quite understand why all the stores are small. The sidewalks are smaller too.\n\nI liked seeing the streetcar going in every direction. Although getting on and off is pretty unsafe, as there's no platform, you're literally stepping onto the road.\n\nI saw groups of chinese and korean people hanging out as I walked Yonge Street, I thought about what my life would be like if I grew up here or if I went to school here.\n\nIt made me think about how much a place shapes you.\n","data":{"title":"Airflow Summit Day 1","tags":"tech, journal","date":"Sep 19, 2023"},"filePath":"airflow-conf.md"},{"content":"\n![toronto](/images/toronto.jpeg)\n\nI'm flying to Toronto today.\n\nIt's my first time going to Canada.\n\nI read \"The Sun Also Rises\" by Ernest Hemingway on the plane.\n\nIt's situated in Paris in the 1920s, so it intertwines a lot of French words and locations in the text.

This often leads to uncovering new insights and connections that might not be apparent through mere reading or listening.\n- **Articulation**: Putting thoughts into words forces a person to clarify their understanding. This process of articulation helps in identifying areas where the understanding might be vague or incomplete.\n- **Reflection**: Writing allows for reflection on the subject matter, enabling the learner to connect new information with existing knowledge. This synthesis helps in creating a more robust and interconnected understanding of the subject.\n- **Revelation of Gaps**: Sometimes, the act of writing reveals areas where the knowledge is lacking or inconsistent. Recognizing these gaps is the first step towards filling them and achieving a more complete understanding.\n\nApply the feynman technique when writing:\n\n1. Choose a concept you want to learn about.\n2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student. Use simple language and avoid jargon\n3. Identify gaps in your explanation.

A new UX for asking questions of code, and get answers through iteratively searching, browsing, navigating, and reading code\n2. Code is already designed to be understood by machines, so we should take advantage of that structure. It also has unique requirements; we want to search for punctuation, no stemming, keep stop words, and search with regex.\n3. Github scale is a unique challenge. Deploying on elasticsearch took months to index (8 mil repos). Today there are 200m. It's not static, and it's constantly changing. Right now, you can search **45 mil repos**, representing **115 TB of code** and **15.5b documents**.\n\n## just use grep\n\nIn programming, always start with what the naive approach; in this case, it's grep.\n\nLet's do a little napkin math.\n\nOn a machine with 8 core intel CPU, [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) can run an exhaustive regex query on a 13GB file cached in memory in 2.76 seconds.\n\nThis isn't going to work with the amount of data they have.\n\nCode search runs on 64 core, 32 machine clusters.\n\nEven if they put 115 TB of code in memory, assuming perfect parallelization of work, they're going to saturate 2,048 CPU cores for 96 seconds to serve a single query.\n\nAnd only that one query can run. This comes up to 0.01 queries per second (QPS).\n\nThere's no cost-effective way to scale this approach to all of Github's code.\n\nWe need to build an index.\n\n## Search index primer\n\nTo speed up queries, we need to pre-compute a bunch of information in the form of indices.\n\nThere are two indexing techniques: **forward and inverted index**.\n\nA [forward index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing#The_forward_index) stores a list of words for each document.\n\nAn [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) would be the opposite, mapping content to a set of documents that contain them.\n\nFor code search, they built a special type of inverted index called [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) index, useful for looking up substrings of content.\n\nTo perform a search, they intersect the results of multiple lookups to give the list of documents where the string appears. With a trigram index, there's four lookups for the query \"limits\" : `lim`, `imi`, `mit`, and `its`.\n\nUnlike a hashmap, these indices are too big to fit into memory.\n\nWe build **iterators** to lazily return sorted document IDs (based on ranking of each document) and we intersect and union the iterators and read far enough to fetch the requested number of results. This way they never have to keep the entire entire posting list.\n\n## Indexing 45 million repos\n\nwe have the technique, now to to figure out how to built the index efficiently.\n\nwe need to figure out some insights into the data we have which guides our approach.\n\nwe know two things: Git's use of [content addressable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage?useskin=vector) and that there's a lot of duplicate content on GitHub.\n\nThis leads us to two decisions:\n\n1. Shard by Git [blob](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) object ID.\n   - nice way to evenly distributed docs between shards while avoiding duplication.\n   - scale no. of shards as necessary\n2. Model index as tree\n   - use delta encoding to reduce amount of crawling and to optimize metadata\n   - metadata = list of locations for documents (path, branch, repo) and info about the objects (repo name, owner, visibility)\n\n## building the index\n\nTo ingest all the repositories for the first time, one key property is we **optimize the order** which we do the initial ingest to **make the most of delta encoding**.\n\nWe do this by using a novel probabilistic data structure representing repository similarity and by driving ingest order from a level order traversal of a MST of a graph of repository similarity.\n\nUsing this order, each repo is crawled by diffing it against its parent in the delta tree. This means we only need to crawl blobs unique to that repo, not the entire repo.\n\nHere's the process.\n\n1. Kafka provides events (`git push`) that tells us to index something.\n2. A bunch of crawlers interact with Git and a service to extract symbols from code.\n3. Kafka is used again to allow each shard to consume documents for indexing.\n4. The data is partitioned between shards. Each shard consumes a single Kafka partition in the topic.\n   - **Indexing is decoupled from crawling** through the use of Kafka and the **ordering** of messages in Kafka is how we gain **query consistency**.\n5. Indexer shards take the documents and build the indices\n   - tokenizing to construct n-gram indices (for content, symbols) and other useful indices (languages, owners, etc) before serializing and flushing to disk when enough work as accumulated.\n6. Finally the shards run compaction to collapse up smaller indices to larger onces that are more efficient to query.\n   - Compaction also k-merges the posting list by score so relevant documents have lower IDs and will be returned first by lazy iterators.\n\nDuring initial ingest, we delay compact and do one big run at the end, but then as index keeps up with incremental changes, compaction is run on shorter intervals to handle things like document deletion.\n\n![Alt text](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Canvas_1-1.png?w%253D1376)\n\n## Life of a query\n\n![Alt text](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/code-search.png?w%253D1376)\n\nRedis is used to **manage quotas** and **cache some access control data**.\n\n1. front end accepts user query and passes it to query service\n2. service parses query into abstract syntax tree and rewrites it\n   - resolves languages to canonical [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) language ID (determine what langauge it is)\n   - tags extra clauses for permissions and scopes\n3. Fan out and send n concurrent request\n   - query must be sent to each shard in search cluster due to sharding strategy\n4. Conversion of query to lookup information in indices\n   - regex gets translated into a series of substring queries on ngram indices\n   - [trigrams](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) are sweet spot in design space, but causes problems at scale. GitHub uses \"sparse grams\", a dynamic gram size.\n5. Iterators from each clause are run (and = intersect; or = union)\n   - returns a list of documents\n   - double check each document before scoring, sorting, and returning requested number of results\n6.

They might not have thought about your problem as much as you have.\n\nAnother skill is to be **willing to do gruntwork**, especially looking at data. Jason had to spend 40+ hours to do data labelling and validation.\n\nThe reality of research is a lot of hard work and drudgery, and it's an important part of the research process. It can help you build intuition about the research.\n\nThe final skill is being a **good communicator**.\n\nCommunicating well makes you more trustworthy to work with.\n\nDon't make promises you can't keep, be realistic about when you can meet deadlines and finishing tasks.\n\nBe specific when communicating blockers, instead of \"X doesn't work\", say \"X didn't work when I tried it using formulation F on model M using dataset D\" which decreases the _mental load_ of the other person.\n","data":{"title":"Most Important Traits for AI Research","tags":"AI","date":"Jul 18, 2023"},"filePath":"research.md"},{"content":"\nWent to my first [LLM meetup](https://www.meetup.com/elastic-san-francisco-user-group/events/294476508) today.\n\nIt was hosted at the Dropbox office in SF.\n\nThere was free food and swags again.\n\nThe panelist were:\n\n- [Harrison Chase](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-chase-961287118/) – LangChain\n- [Baha Azarmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahaaldine/) – Elastic\n- [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/) – Claypot AI\n- [Karina Nguyen](https://karinanguyen.com/) – Anthropic\n\nThe CEO of Dropbox [Drew Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Houston?useskin=vector) hosted the panel.\n\nI felt so lucky to be at this event.

It can:\n\n1. erase inaccurate/outdated information (due to errors in labelling or changes in environment)\n2. remove harmful, manipulated, or outlier data\n\nIt's also related to other areas of ML\n\n- [Differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy?useskin=vector): guarantee no particular training example has too large an influence on model (stronger goal compared to unlearning)\n- [life-long learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07569): models that can learn continuously while maintaining previously-acquired skills\n- [fairness](https://tinyurl.com/28g452mh): correct unfair biases or disparate treatment of members belonging to different groups\n\n### Anatomy\n\nAn unlearning algorithm takes a pre-trained model, and one or more samples from the forget set to unlearn.\n\nFrom the model, forget set, and retain set, the unlearning algorithm produces an **unlearned** model.\n\nThe goal: unlearned model === model trained without forget set\n\n### Challenges\n\nIt is complex as it involves several **conflicting objectives**:\n\n1. forgetting requested data\n1. maintaining model's utility (accuracy on retained and held-out data)\n1. efficiency\n\nExisting algorithms make different tradeoff\n\n- full retraining = forget ✅, utility ✅, efficiency ❌\n- adding noise to weights = forget ✅, utility ❌\n\nThe second challenge is the inconsistent **evaluation**.\n\n- [classification accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04933) on samples to unlearn\n- [distance](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wu20b.html) to fully retrained model\n- error rate of membership inference attacks as [metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09880) for [forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10981) [quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02205)\n\n### Challenge\n\nThe first [NeurIPS 2023 Machine Unlearning Challenge](https://unlearning-challenge.github.io/) was announced to advanced this field.\n\nA [starting kit](https://github.com/unlearning-challenge/starting-kit) and a sample [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/unlearning-challenge/starting-kit/blob/main/unlearning-CIFAR10.ipynb) is also released.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nHow is forgetting evaluated?\n\nUsing tools inspired by Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) such as [LiRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570).\n\nThey were first developed in privacy and security literature with the goal of inferring which **examples** were **part of the training set**.\n\nIntuitively, if unlearning was successful, there will be **no trace of the forget set**, causing MIA to fail; since the attacker will be _unable_ to infer the forget set was part of the original training set.\n\nIn addition, distribution of retrained models and unlearned models will be compared.

For skilled players, Blackjack offers the best odds, potentially allowing professional players to win $1.50 to $3 per $100 from the casino.\n- Memorizing a basic strategy chart in Blackjack can minimize loss to around 60 cents per a hundred dollars.\n- Card counting in Blackjack involves tracking face cards and aces. More aces mean a higher chance of hitting blackjack, while more face cards increase the chance of the dealer busting.\n- The Martingale algorithm, which doubles your bet after every loss, is generally ineffective due to table limits.\n- In Craps, the follow-on bets offer even odds, allowing prolonged play without losing money.\n- In Poker, the best strategy is to be highly skilled and play against less skilled players with a lot of money to lose.\n- Roulette is generally impossible to win consistently due to the casino's edge, though some older casinos with unbalanced wheels could have exploitable biases.\n\n**Casino Policies and Technology:**\n\n- Casinos tend not to kick players out for winning, banking on the law of large numbers for eventual profit. However, if a player is identified as a professional with an edge, the casino can eject them using trespassing laws.\n- In New Jersey, casinos can't kick players out but can ruin the game for them by putting the cut cards at the front, making card counting impossible.\n- Casinos may use RFID embedded chips to track player betting and identify anomalies, possibly flagging certain players for observation.\n\n**Psychology and Gambling:**\n\n- The thrill of winning often outweighs the pain of losing for true gamblers, driving them to continue gambling.\n\n**Slot Machines:**\n\n- Slot machines are labor-efficient and major revenue generators for the casino, with adjustable odds ranging from 80% to 99% payout.\n- Progressive slot machines increase the potential payout as players lose, with optimal play possible when the bank is above a certain level.\n\n**Monte Carlo Simulation and Statistical Concepts:**\n\n- Each game has a different edge calculated through Monte Carlo simulations, where millions of hands are simulated to calculate expected wins or losses.\n- The concepts of expected value and the law of large numbers underpin casino games' outcomes, with every hand being independent, illustrating the \"hot hand fallacy.\"\n- Splitting aces and eights in Blackjack provides higher winning odds according to Monte Carlo simulations.\n","data":{"title":"Casino Odds","tags":"facts","date":"Jun 24, 2023"},"filePath":"casino-facts.md"},{"content":"\nWent to my second intern party today in Palo Alto.\n\nWe got in super early at 8:30 p.m. (party was set to start at 8).\n\nWe started playing beer pong, which I'm weirdly good at.\n\nI was a lot more comfortable at this party.\n\nI proactively reached out to people.\n\nI was better at prompting them, being curious about people, and being more relaxed.\n\nI was able to crack some jokes too, and was more natural.\n\nAt one point some friends wanted to dance, dancing still feels awkward, I don't know what to do with my hands.\n\nI met an Armenian guy from Canada and we had a lot of shared interest.\n\nWe talked about startups we want to work for, the work visa situation, and about graduate school.\n\nHe shared a vegan food startup called Climax Foods, which uses AI for food protein.\n\nIt made me realize that there are many companies outside of big tech that is doing interesting stuff, and it could be something that I enjoy and can bring meaning.\n\nI like this part about parties the most, there's so many people there that there's bound to be one person where there's a spark in the conversation.\n\nA good rule of thumb is if you feel like talking to someone, just do it.\n\nIt might lead to something meaningful, a new friendship, a new idea, a new life course.\n\nNo one remembers what you said anyways after a party, and they're probably drunk, so just go for it.\n","data":{"title":"Second Party experience","tags":"journal, talking","date":"Jun 23, 2023"},"filePath":"party2.md"},{"content":"\nThe right question at the right time can change the course of a life, still a turbulent mind, or heal an angry heart.\n\nHere are [12 questions](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/09/12-questions-that-will-change-your-life) that should be asked many times over the course of your life, or even throughout the day.\n\n> 1.

Unfairness - difference in compensation\n4. Sense of reward - what leads to flow and happiness (intrinsic reward), when things push towards extrinsic reward\n\nQuestions to ask yourself\n\n1. Are you really, really exhausted? (emotionally)\n2. Are you embarrassed about the length of your fuse? (compassion fatigue)\n3. Did your sense of meaning go away?\n\nTreatment\n\n- Organizational - pay attention to burnout by focusing on workloads, sense of values, and reward\n- Individual - take care of yourself and think about how you're structuring your relationship with work. Putting too much of identity emphasis on work? Leaving the best of yourself for work, and leftovers for personal relationship?\n  - Invest on relationship outside of work and engage with your health and hobbies. Develop an identity outside of work.\n","data":{"title":"Signs of Burnout","tags":"work, life","date":"Jun 19, 2023"},"filePath":"burnout.md"},{"content":"\nSome [advice](https://twitter.com/snowmaker/status/1670557756175290369?s=20) by [Jared Friedman](https://twitter.com/snowmaker) on startups for students.\n\n- **Go cofounder first** (rather than idea).\n  - Talk to some of your friends who are startup-inclined, and see who would be up for brainstorming startup ideas.\n  - **Only about 5%** of the college-age founders YC funds are solo founders.\n  - The limiting reagent in the # of startups in the world is not the # of good ideas. I'd argue it is the # of **high quality teams**. A high quality team is 2-4 smart people who know each other well, have at least 1 technical founder, and are all serious about doing a startup.\n- **Startups are not a thinking game, they are a doing game**.\n  - If you don't have good startup ideas now, the way to get better ones isn't to think really hard, it's to build stuff and launch it and learn from what happens.\n  - Building and launching your own products, end-to-end, is especially important experience to have. **Building software at large companies means tweaking features of large existing products. That's a very different skill from launching your own stuff**.\n- Do it **first thing after you graduate**\n  - Why? You don't have to quit anything to do a startup when you graduate. And if it doesn't work out, it just becomes your first job.\n  - dropping out should be an edge case. only do it if you're not liking school or your project takes off.\n  - working for a few years first has a downside: it'll be harder to convince your college friends then, they'll have settled into their job or moved.\n- Startups >>> big tech\n  - choose a startup; you'll learn more relevant skills, pick up startup culture, and meet other people who are more interested in startups.\n  - more ex-Stripe founders were funded than ex-Google founders in recent YC batch, despite the fact that Google has 27 times as many employees as Stripe.\n- Apply for YC\n  - How much traction? None. Most of the companies YC funds are idea stage or prototype stage.\n  - No visa issues at YC, great for international students\n\nMore on PG's [blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html).\n","data":{"title":"Startup Advice for Students","tags":"startup","date":"Jun 18, 2023"},"filePath":"startup-lesson.md"},{"content":"\nFound a [thread](https://twitter.com/jacobrintamaki/status/1670249966806376449?s=20) of memorable moments from the [2023 Y Combinator summer conference](https://www.ycombinator.com/events/summerconf2023) which I did not get accepted into.\n\n[Garry Tan](https://twitter.com/garrytan)\n\n- “Go to therapy” - it seems expensive, but not getting it is more expensive\n- “If you’re in a job where you’re not learning or earning a lot leave it.

It warmed up our tummies.\n\nAfter that we went into some shops, and got 2 scoops of homemade ice cream on the way back to the car.\n\nNext stop was Cannery Row.\n\nIt was a nice street, with restaurants and gift shops around.\n\nI saw a statue of John Steinbeck, and started seeing him on street pole banners, then found out he wrote a book about Cannery Row.\n\nWalking down the street to the end brought us to the aquarium.\n\nI looked up the Antique mall and found out it closing in 45 minutes. I rushed my parents to get to that place in time.\n\nI really loved the Antique mall. It was two floors filled with antiques owned by over 100 local dealers. I could totally spend at least 2 hours there. I looked at some vintage posters, saw an atari game console, vintage hot wheels, old t-shirts, and a bunch of other stuff. The whole time I figuring out what I could snatch for my apartment back in Iowa.\n\nWith 5 minutes left until closing, I had to get something. I frantically hunted for clothes, and managed to thrift a thick Rock Oil racing white sweater and a Flaming Santa Cruz black t-shirt.\n\nNext, we went to the Lighthouse bookstore.\n\nMy mom bought a cooking book. I read some poetry.\n\nIt was dinner time.\n\nSea harvest was the closest restaurant. We were cold and hungry.\n\nI got two plates of grilled seafood. We chose sea bass and salmon.\n\nIt was my first time trying sea bass. I was surprised at its richness in fats. The salmon was cooked to perfection. The rice that came with it also tasted good.\n\nIt was already 8pm, 17-mile drive can happen another day.\n\nBefore leaving, I wanted to drive along the coast.\n\nWe stopped at Perkins park and admired the wide bed of purple flowers, and the ocean crashing on the rocks.\n\nI drove further down and saw some people sitting at the beach, with a campfire in the middle.\n\nI got out and took some pictures.\n\nIt was getting dark.\n\nWe said goodbye to Monterey.\n","data":{"title":"Monterey Trip","tags":"travel, journal","date":"Jun 3, 2023"},"filePath":"monterey.md"},{"content":"\n> 1.

These days I'm thinking hard about who I can get lunch with.\n\nHowever, with change comes new opportunity for growth and for meeting new people.

I then looked at his shoes. No nothing to ask there it was regular boots. What if I directly ask what team he belongs to? No that's way to early in a conversation with a stranger to bring up.\n\nI thought about it for so long that eventually the shuttle came.\n\nIn my mind I'm thinking, because of my overthinking, I missed the opportunity to network with this person, who could've fed me a new piece of information, or connected me with another person, both of which could've changed the course of my life.\n\nI went in the shuttle, want to the very last row, and sat beside a chinese guy in his mid 20s.\n\nI've seen him before at the office.\n\nSo for 30 seconds, I sat down thinking whether I should tell him directly.

We both were animated and exchanged contacts.\n\nI left the shuttle smiling.\n\nI love the moments where you can connect with another person, when both parties have something to relate to, and surprising little moments like having the same name.\n\nI aim to focus less on the anxiety of the infinite amount of possibilities from talking to strangers, and more on the opportunity of making genuine connections.\n\nHopefully by the end of the summer, I'll be more comfortable with serendipitous conversations with strangers.\n","data":{"title":"Talking to Strangers","tags":"journal, talking","date":"May 19, 2023"},"filePath":"strangers.md"},{"content":"\nI came back to my airbnb after walking 30 minutes from a bus stop and saw a car parked out.\n\nSomeone must be moving in I thought, I was intrigued yet dreaded to find out who it was.\n\nTo my surprise it was a middle age lady in one of the empty rooms taking pictures.\n\nIt was the airbnb host.\n\nShe had a kind smile, and spoke english with an accent.\n\nShe asked where I stayed and I told her upstairs, A3. She began explaining that she was the one communicating with me on Airbnb messages.\n\nI was a little embarrassed, since my first day here I was overwhelmed, so I said some things how there were 9 rooms in the apartment and I wasn't comfortable staying here. I also shortened my stay on the first day itself.\n\nI was about to heat up my $9 bento box from 99 ranch for dinner but saw her moving a chair into the house and I went to help her.\n\nWe got to the age-old \"where you are from\" question and I blurted out Mandarin once she mentioned she was from China.\n\nI usually try to keep conversations in English. Even back at university, I wouldn't converse in mandarin with a Chinese, because it usually backfires when I fail to express myself due to my primary school level of Chinese vocabulary.\n\nShe asked if I needed anything, and I asked about the red bicycle that's been sitting the living room the past five days I have been here, untouched and unmoved.\n\nShe mentioned it was a girl's bike, but she could lend me a bike that belonged to her nephew at her house nearby.\n\nShe said to give her 20 minutes, and we can go check on the bike together.\n\nIt was already 7:30pm, and I was getting hungry, but I couldn't turn down this opportunity.\n\nWhat I initially thought would be a 5 minute thing turned out to be over an hour, we went to two separate houses. After discovering the bike had a flat tire at the first house, we moved the bike to a second house to get an air pump, but the pump we found at a shed was a ball pump. So we ended up leaving the bike there, and headed back to bring me home.\n\nIn the car, I got to know her a little better.\n\nShe moved here from China with her only daughter in 2017, and has been in California since. \"Time flies\" she said. She's an art teacher, and that influenced her daughter to study art therapy. Apparently, there are only 42 universities that offer this. She expressed her dissatisfaction about the daughter's choice of career path, but was understanding given that's her interest.\n\nWe also talked about my major, living cost in Iowa, whether I wanted to buy a car that she was selling for 2k, about my parents visiting, what my dad does, about durian being really expensive in California (~10 dollars per pound), and $60 in China.\n\nShe asked me about layoffs and AI, and my brain's english to chinese translation feature wasn't working very well, but I think she got some idea of what I was saying.\n\nEven though we both have completely different backgrounds and upbringing, we had a shared understanding of what it's like to be far away from home, and the struggles of starting a life somewhere new.\n\nI like this part about Airbnbs.\n\nYou get to meet different people from all walks of life and realize we're all just the same underneath.\n","data":{"title":"Meeting my Airbnb Host","tags":"journal","date":"May 18, 2023"},"filePath":"host.md"},{"content":"\nI reluctantly returned as an intern at the same team with Tesla this week.\n\nI say reluctantly because they were ready to offer me a full-time position, but I delayed graduation on purpose, and pushed back my last core class I needed to graduate to the fall semester, so that I could use my [CPT](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/practical-training) at another company and gain some experience on actual data science work in a mature team with best practices in place.\n\nTo me that means being able to work with senior data scientists, having access to good data infrastructure, writing code that goes into production, running experiments and doing ad-hoc analysis that are actually seen by people and have value, working with data engineers, writing data pipelines, all that fun stuff.\n\nFor summer, I applied to 120+ companies and only got 2 interviews.

(not common to see a property that returns complex data structures)\n\nThere's more to properties, you can make attributes read only by adding an underscore in front of variables to hide them, and create properties for them.\n\nThere's also property setters and deleters, which let's you directly assign attributes and to clean up other attributes that are auxiliary to the main property attribute.\n\nAlso @property apparently isn't a decorator, but a [descriptor](https://tushar.lol/post/descriptors/), which lets you customize the behavior getter/setter/deleter methods.\n\nThat's all for today.\n","data":{"title":"@property in Python","tags":"python","date":"May 16, 2023"},"filePath":"property.md"},{"content":"\nIt was my second time trying out golfing at Top Golf today.\n\nI hit ~80 shots, and only a handful were good.\n\nTowards the end, my hands were starting to sore and all my shots were bad.\n\nYou need a firm grip and a stable swing, and I don't think my arms are strong enough, my golf club kept moving around.\n\nI also think I'm not tall enough. I was using the hybrid club and had to hold it in an awkward position, and it kept hitting my arm.\n\n_Update: It's the day after I wrote this and arms and shoulders are sore and my grip is weak._\n\nSome good tips I got for golfing are:\n\n- don't look where the ball goes as you're hitting it\n- bend your knees, loosen your shoulders and relax, I found taking a breath before each shot helped\n- bend your club towards where you want to hit, it helps direct the shot\n- don't charge for the shot at the start and hit like an axe, it should be a single circular motion that flows like water\n- focus on your grip and stance, then work on other things\n- focus on hitting the bottom of the ball\n\nHere's what each club does in golf\n\n## Woods\n\n> 1W - your main driver...typical loft is 9 degrees up to 15. These used to be actual wood, but now are getting more bulky, and are all metal.\n>\n> 3W - your fairway driver...hard club to master. Used for long par 4s or par 5 second shots.\n>\n> 5W - lofted to around 16-19 degrees. Can be used in the rough, hits a little shorter than > your 3W, and has a more shallow swingplane.\n\n## Hybrids\n\n> These are clubs that will look and feel like a hybrid between an iron and wood. They have no cavity back (empty back like an iron), but stand straighter up at address and have more loft. Hybrids have the same lofts as many of the irons, but give more consistency, strength, and ease of hitting the ball in the air than their iron counterpart. They are popular for hitting out of rough because of their ability to slide into the ball and not catch the grass behind the ball (this causes a flyer or a ball hit further than needed with little spin because the grass covers the grooves). They are also popular for seniors or women, but not exclusively. Kind of cool clubs and relatively new.\n\n## Irons\n\n> 1 - nobody can hit this. Not even God. Don't know why I'm even including it.\n>\n> 2-4 - your long irons. Shallow face, not as much loft. You can hit these farther, and with > less backspin. They are typically used for distances on the fairway, anywhere from 180-240 to the green.\n>\n> 5-8 - your mid irons. More loft, used to hit from 130-180 yards out from the green. More > spin, and higher trajectory.\n>\n> 9, PW, GW, AW, SW - your short irons and wedges. 9 iron and PW are your clubs from 130 in. > Gap wedge is a wedge between your pitching and sand wedges. Auxiliary is a specialty wedge > that you could honestly make any loft. Sand wedge is for bunkers, or if you feel > comfortable with it, chipping and flop shots.\n\n## Putter\n\n> No explanation necessary, although there are different types of putters. An offset (referring to where the shaft meets the head) teardrop (shape) putter is a popular one.\n","data":{"title":"Golfing Experience","tags":"journal, sports","date":"May 15, 2023"},"filePath":"golf.md"},{"content":"\nIn classification problems, there's a tradeoff between precision and recall.\n\nIf you forgot what precision and recall are, here's a good [analogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qdai89/i_just_explained_recallprecision_to_a_nonds_and/) to recap.\n\nLet's say you're fishing with a huge net. You cast it and catch 80 fishes out of the 100. That's 80% recall. However, you also catch 80 rocks in the process, that's 50% precision.\n\nYou can use a smaller net, and target a pocket of the lake with only fish and no rocks, but you only get 20 of the fish, but no rocks. That's 20% recall and 100% precision.\n\nGet the idea?\n\nRecall = what proportion of the things you catch are actually fish (true). (ex1: 80 / 100)\n\nPrecision = of those you catch, what proportion are fish. (ex1: 80 / 80 + 80)\n\nTo balance between these two metrics, we optimize the [F1 score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score), which is their [harmonic mean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harmonic_mean).\n\nHowever, in some cases, precision would be more important than recall, and vice versa.\n\nHere's where the [F Beta](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score#F%CE%B2_score) scofe comes in handy.\n\nWe can adjust the value of Beta to assign higher weight to either precision or recall.\n\nBelow is a [toy example](https://github.com/MenaWANG/ML_toy_examples/blob/main/modeling%20algorithm/metrics-fbeta.ipynb).\n\n```py\nfrom sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score\n\n# define two models\ny_true           = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # half positive\ny_pred_precision = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # perfect precision, two false negatives\ny_pred_recall    = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] # perfect recall, three false positives\n\nperfect_precision = [y_true, y_pred_precision]\nperfect_recall    = [y_true, y_pred_recall]\n\n# the two models score similarly when beta = 1\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=1))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=1))\n\n# higher perfect precision scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=0.5))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=0.5))\n\n# higher perfect recall scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=2))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=2))\n\n```\n\nThe [beta parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) determines the weight of recall in the combined score.\n\nbeta < 1 lends more weight to precision, while beta > 1 favors recall (beta -> 0 considers only precision, beta -> +inf only recall).\n","data":{"title":"F-beta score","tags":"ML","date":"May 14, 2023"},"filePath":"fbeta.md"},{"content":"\nI flew from Iowa to San Jose today.\n\nWith time on my hands, and the state of flow that being on a plane induces, I finally got around to my queue on [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) and read a couple of interesting articles which I'm going to list here.\n\nThere are a lot of great ideas here, especially the ones under life and career.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler\n\nSome notes on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qKv5TBaOA) on essential coding topics to help me become a better programmer.\n\n## #1 Not using programming standards\n\nThere are [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) to follow in writing code such as whitespacing, file structure, and naming to make code consistent and readable.\n\nIt's especially important when working with other people, as it allows everyone to rely on shared expectations.\n\nNot keeping standards is like switching fonts all the time, you can still read it but the differences can throw people off.\n\n## #2 Not learning programming principles\n\nProgramming [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles) guide you into becoming a better programmer. They're like raw philosophies of code.\n\n[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is an acronym for five design principles intended to make OOP more maintainable.\n\n- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle\n  - aim to break code down into modules of one responsibility each, it's more code, but you can test it more cleanly and use parts of it elsewhere\n- **O**pen/Closed Principle\n  - design modules to be able to add new functionality in the future without making changes to them, extending but never modify directly\n- **L**iskov Substitution Principle\n  - only extend modules when it's still the same type at heart, if not, create its own type\n- **I**nterface Segregation Principle\n  - modules shouldn't need to know about functionality they don't use, split modules into smaller abstractions like interfaces, is useful when testing as it allows us to mock out only the functionality that each module needs\n- **D**ependency Inversion Principle\n  - code should communicate with each other abstractly through interfaces, allows for swapping parts of code\n\nCombining these principles ends up decoupling your code, which gives you modules that are independent of each other, making code maintainable, reusable, scalable and testable.\n\n## #3 Not using programming design patterns\n\n[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) give real solution to code problems, but they aren't fixed implementations.\n\nThey're used to architect software solutions, matching the right shapes to fit the needs our software has.\n\nTHere are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_type) main types\n\n1. Creational patterns - make and control new object instances i.e. factory pattern\n2. Structural patterns - how we organize and manipulate objects i.e. adapter pattern\n3. Behavioral Patterns - how code functions and how it communicates with other parts of the code, i.e. observer pattern.\n\nThese patterns are used in big corporations, and creates a universal vocabulary of programming.\n\n## #4 Bad naming\n\nBad variable naming makes code hard to interpret.\n\nHere are some fixes\n\n1. Avoid encoding - remove type information in variable\n2. Expand abbreviation - expand to full name to avoid miscommunication\n3. Use clear distinction - use names that more accurately represent nuances in code\n4. Replace \"magic\" values - define as named constants, clarifies significance and keeps things in sync if used elsewhere\n5. Be descriptive with names - find balance between clear enough without being verbose\n\n## #5 Not testing code\n\nWriting test can be difficult when code is not properly architected.\n\nAt the high level, there's end-to-end testing, which lets you test code as the end user.\n\nAny spaghetti code can be e2e tested since it doesn't really touch the code, but only what it delivers. It's also more tricky to setup since it requires a fully functional application running.\n\nAt the lower-level are unit tests that verify the operations of modules in isolation, and integration test that examines how modules interact with each other.\n\nApplying SOLID principles makes testing easier.\n\n## #6 Bad time management\n\nTime estimation is hard.\n\nRule of thumb is to 2x or 3x initial time estimate for a task.\n\nAccount for unknown problems along the way.\n\nRemember that creation goes hand-in-hand in problems.\n\nIt's better to overestimate schedule than underestimate it.\n\n## #7 Rushing\n\nThings can feel great when blazing through projects, there's a place for that in prototypes.\n\nBut if this is a long-term project, take your time and think things through from day-one.\n\nIt can give a better foundation to work from and avoid code debt.\n\nOvertime, you'll be saving time from batting decisions with no easy fix because of poor architecture.\n","data":{"title":"7 Deadly Sins of Programming","tags":"programming","date":"May 12, 2023"},"filePath":"sins.md"},{"content":"\nI had a 30-min chat today with [Stefan Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanmai/), who's been at Amazon and Meta for 10 years.\n\nHere are some questions I asked and his response (poorly paraphrased from what I can recall).\n\n**How to pivot from data analytics to SWE?**\n\n> Frame your resume, tell the right stories. If you collected data, built pipelines, build a product, shipped something, write it all down in your resume.\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out? What do you look for when you hire?**\n\n> A lot of candidates look the same in coding tests. We look more at what they do outside of class, open source projects. There are some people who just have the love for building something, creating products that makes then stand out. These are the people that have deep knowledge about a certain thing, and having a conversation with them you can get signals that they've done a lot of shit.\n\n**What are some common mistakes candidates make?**\n\n> Nerves during interviews. Giving up on a problem at 0, and not trying to solve till 50% or 80%. Not asking edge cases when starting out in interview, which brings up a lot of issues later in your code. Advice is to just take a deep breath before each question. Calm down.\n\n**Were there key decisions or actions you took early in your career that contributed most to your success?**\n\n> It was small changes that eventually led me to where I am. I started out in consulting doing SWE, and I wanted to get into ML. I wanted to get into big tech to learn from great people. Just be sure rate of learning is positive. The industry is fast-paced and you have to be learning constantly.\n\n**Thoughts on Gen AI and how it impacts career?**\n\n> in every hype cycle of AI and ML people make a lot of predictions about what's going to happen, but things end up being the same. Things are definitely going to be different, it's going to be like the internet boom where a lot of business started making websites, APIs, etc. it'll happen with Gen AI as well. For ML, there's less focus on the data acquisition and training models, more on fine-tuning. For SWE, CRUD apps in webdev are going to go away, you can build basic websites with english now, although there are complexities with web dev now. So focus on the fundamentals and just pursue what you're interested in.\n\n**Culture difference in Amazon vs Meta?**\n\n> Amazon operates on a small margin, and it's very process-based. They're focused on how to optimize and improve their operations and processes. It also has a hierarchy where each team is siloed and you don't get access to what other teams are doing. They do have an annual ML conference where it's like academia, they have posters presenting their research. Meta operates on a high margin, they have more money to burn on new things. It's also very unstructured, you won't find documentation for something you need, so you'll be going across teams to get answers. Meta also values emotional intelligence. It's a big company, so experience is very team dependent.\n\n**What would you tell your younger self before starting a company?**\n\n> To start sooner. I wanted to start a company when I was your age, and wanted to get some experience from big tech. For some time I thought I didn't have enough experience yet or wasn't a good enough leader to start my own company. But now I believe 2-3 years is enough at a big tech and it can teach almost everything you need to know to found your own company. But working at big tech for so long did give me the financial ability to pursue my ventures now.\n\nSome mistakes:\n\n- felt intimidating talking to him right off the bat, I could tell he was really intelligent and articulate, everything he said was dense and rich in information.\n- I felt like I was asking really cliche and basic questions, and was thinking about better questions to ask midway, which made me lose focus about he was saying.\n- I was saying \"that's a good answer/point\", \"thank you for the insights\", but had nothing to respond back to or add on to what he said. I was also optimizing to ask as many questions as possible, but I need a less awkward way to respond back.\n- I was not confident in asking questions, I was hesitant and incoherent instead of being direct and clear.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n- Treat coffee chats as a conversation with a friend.\n- I should follow up on their response so I can latch on to something, give it time to digest and form structure.\n- I should do more research and ask questions that are high-value and specific to the person, my questions were too generic.\n\nI found this collection of interviews with ML practitioners on [ApplyingML](https://applyingml.com/mentors/) with some good questions and might be using some of these for my future coffee chats.\n","data":{"title":"Coffee chat with Stefan Mai","tags":"AI","date":"May 11, 2023"},"filePath":"stefan.md"},{"content":"\nFinished my finals today and thought about dumping some thoughts on exams.\n\nIn Malaysia, there's this big test at the end of senior year of high school that everyone (in the national curriculum) takes before entering college.

I can get an A in the class but still not be able to **really** understand what's going on\n- puts me on a number line, directly comparing me with others, getting bad grades makes me feel like a failure.\n- anxiety-inducing and high pressure, my parents are paying a lot of money take courses as an international student, so I'm pressured to do well.\n- you're working in a vacuum and forced to work with what you have in your head, without any access to resources, which is unrealistic in the real-world.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n- I forget a lot from my previous classes because I don't apply information I've learned\n- I don't understand a class because I didn't seek to understand it in the first place, necessity is the impetus for learning, and I could never connect the information in my classes to something I can practically use at the time I was learning it.\n- I overthink a lot in exams, and when I overthink, I tend to change my mind about answers that were already correct, so I should pay attention to my first intuitions more.\n- the belief that you're not good at something is powerful, my inner thoughts when I face a problem I can't solve is \"I don't know this\", \"I'm screwed\", and it makes me give up really fast, clouds my judgement, and turns an easy problem into a complex one.\n","data":{"title":"On exams","tags":"journal","date":"May 10, 2023"},"filePath":"exams.md"},{"content":"\n> In Bayesian statistics, model parameters are random variables.\n\nI took a [Bayesian statistics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayesian_statistics) course this semester and I think it'll be the most valuable course I'll ever be taking in my 4 year of undergraduate studies in Statistics at ISU.\n\nThere's a decay rate for knowledge that I retain for the classes I take, and it'll be the same for this course as well. But if there's one thing I want to take away from this course, it's the mindset of being a Bayesian\n\nI came across this [article](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/bayesian-inference-from-first-principles) by Christoph Molnar, and what better way to end the chapter of this course by understanding Bayesian modelling from first principles.\n\nThe first principles view of Bayesian statistics is that model parameters are [random variables](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Random_variable).\n\nThe model here can be a simple distribution, and the parameters - the mean of a distribution, coefficients in linear regression, the correlation coefficient - are variables with their own distributions.\n\nThis notion contrasts the frequentist view of treating parameters as fixed but unknown quantities. By treating them as random variables, we acknowledge the uncertainty around their true values.\n\nWe're also, later on, able to incorporate our beliefs since we assign [probability distributions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Probability_distribution) to these parameters.\n\nSo, we've established parameters are variables.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish in Bayesian modelling?\n\nWe start with data about an event, and we want to estimate a parameter of interest (θ). This parameter can be anything from effectiveness of a drug to the click-through rate on a website.\n\nIn mathematical form, our model is estimating P(θ|X), the parameter distribution for θ given the data X.\n\nBut we can't directly estimate P(θ|X), we don't know the true values of parameters in the real-word.\n\nIt's much more natural to estimate the inverse - P(X|θ) the distribution of data given parameters.\n\nAnd here's where [Bayes' theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayes'_theorem) come into the picture.\n\nThis theorem inverse the condition to P(X|θ), a.k.a the [likelihood function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Likelihood_function).\n\nFrom this theorem, we are given two things: P(θ), the prior distribution and P(X), the evidence.\n\nP(θ) is your beliefs about the world. You have to specify this BEFORE observing the data.\n\nThis prior can be informative or non-informative, and that determines how much your belief will influence the estimation. A non-informative prior means the data has more influence, and vice versa.\n\nIn statistics jargon, the posterior mean is the weighted average between the prior mean and the sample mean.\n\nThe cool thing being Bayesian is once you get an estimation P(θ|X), with the power of sequential updating, that becomes your new prior.\n\nThis idea of updating your priors is very intuitive, we're collecting new data and updating our beliefs from our interactions and experiences in everyday life.\n\nBayes' theorem also involves the term P(X) called the evidence, which is usually unfeasible to estimate. It's also known as the normalizing constant.\n\nSo instead we take the numerator P(X|θ) P(θ), which is proportional to the posterior distribution.\n\nIn most cases, the posterior distribution is not a known distribution like the Normal or Binomial distribution, so we need to perform sampling from the posterior using techniques such as [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo?useskin=vector).\n\nThere's no use to knowing all this without being able to apply it. So my goal is read [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) and learn [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) to put this knowledge into practice.\n","data":{"title":"A Bayesian mindset","tags":"statistics","date":"May 9, 2023"},"filePath":"bayesian.md"},{"content":"\n> Luke 1:1–4 (NIV): Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\n\nIn the New Testaments, we have four [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\n\nAll of them tell the same story about the life of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus).\n\nThough the four books have many similarities, each author presents a unique perspective on Jesus, emphasizing a different theme for an intended audience.\n\n**Matthew** wrote mainly for Jews, emphasizing that Jesus, the son of David, was the Messiah for whom they were waiting. That’s why he began with a genealogy and includes multiple references to Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Jesus.\n\n**Mark** emphasizes Jesus as the Suffering Servant of God. This was especially relevant to believers in Jesus who were suffering for their faith.\n\n**Luke** was written to Theophilus, a gentile. Luke presents Jesus as the Son of Man and Savior of all people.\n\n**John** presents Christ as the Son of God and Creator of the world.\n\nThere's ongoing debate on the [historical reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels) on the Gospels.\n\nOne thing I found interesting is the only two events that are almost universally agreed upon are the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, and the crucifixion of Jesus by Pontius Pilate.\n","data":{"title":"The Four Gospels","tags":"bible","date":"May 8, 2023"},"filePath":"gospels.md"},{"content":"\nI like taking [pictures](https://vsco.co/benxneo/gallery).\n\nThese photographs capture not only the places I've explored, but the essence of who I was in those moments: who I was, what I was thinking, and how I was feeling.\n\nThey also serve as portals to my past, allowing me relive past experiences and immerse myself in a sea of memories, rekindling emotions that might otherwise have faded away.\n\nOne goal I have, is to get into film photography at some point. I think I'll enjoy it a lot. The craft and detail that goes into taking each shot, and the adventure in choosing the right camera and roll of film.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4Yn16Rw8s) and got to learn a little but more about film photography.\n\nFirst, **how does film work**?\n\nThe basic idea is that film is a roll of plastic containing a magical mix of chemicals that make it sensitive to light.\n\nWhen film is placed into the camera, it lives in complete darkness.\n\nEvery time you shoot a photo, you let light in through the lense. That light then hits the film, and burns it in a way that shapes and color are reflected on the material.\n\nThe second question is **which camera** to choose.\n\nThere are 3 main types of film cameras:\n\n1. SLR (single-lens reflex camera)\n   - what you see on the viewfinder is very close to the image (thanks to mirror)\n   - option to change lenses and shoot manually\n   - bulkier and heavier\n   - who? action photography\n2. Rangefinder\n   - a different type of viewfinder that has framelines that assist you when shooting\n   - not all of them allow you to change the lens (the ones that do are more expensive)\n   - compact, smaller setup\n   - who? street photography\n3. Point & shoot\n   - automatic cameras, no need to set exposure or focus (depending on camera)\n   - require batteries\n   - who? easily capture moments of everyday life (first two requires precision and time)\n\nWhen choosing a **type of film**, there are two variables: style and price.\n\nAnd these films differ in color and contrast.\n\nFor beginners, go with Kodak GOLD 200 (cheapish color film)\n\nNow for **how to shoot**.\n\nWhen shooting film, exposure matters.\n\nOpposite from digital shooting, details in film are harder to recover from the shadows and easier from highlights. So, it's important to expose correctly or slightly overexposed, which means using a light meter.\n","data":{"title":"Film photography 101","tags":"photography","date":"May 7, 2023"},"filePath":"film.md"},{"content":"\n> In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.\n\nI had a practice session today for Sunday's praise and worship, and in one of the songs, the lead singer requested a key change.\n\nKey changes mess up my flow, because I memorize a certain routine to minimize mistakes while playing.\n\nIt was just a simple one-step key change, from C to B-flat, so I could still manage.\n\nI was looking at every chord in the old key on my printed sheet music, and then translating it to the new key in real time.\n\nBut at one point, my visual stimuli of seeing the C chord won over my brain's background process that was telling my hands to play B-flat, causing me to hit the wrong chords.\n\nI thought about why that happens and it turns out I was experiencing the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).\n\nYou've probably experienced this effect yourself in a certain brain teaser.\n\nKnown as the Stroop test, you're given a list of words that are printed in a different color than the meaning of the word. And your task is to name the color of the word, not the word itself, as fast as you can.\n\nFor example, when presented with the word \"[Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw)\", it's easier to say red, as opposed to the color of the text (blue).\n\nThere are some [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Theories) used to explain why this effect happens.\n\nThey're all based on the idea that our brains processes relevant and irrelevant information in parallel, but they both \"race\" to your brain's central processor to be chosen as a response.\n\nThis neurophysiological test has different [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Variations), and can reveal a lot about your brain and how it processes information.\n\nAmong the most important uses is in measuring a person's [selective attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27437-001) capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.\n\nIt can also diagnose different psychiatric and neurological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that studying this effect might help us better understand the black box that is our brain, which can allow us to overcome our fast instinctual thinking, known as System 1 in the book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow?useskin=vector), helping us reach to more logical conclusions.\n","data":{"title":"Stroop effect","tags":"ideas, neuroscience","date":"May 6, 2023"},"filePath":"stroop.md"},{"content":"\nI used to squeeze my to-do list with a lot of tasks, I felt I should spend every minute of my day efficiently.

I follow a lot of smart people there (mostly UWaterloo students), and I'm finding it very valuable so far for expanding my worldview.\n\nBefore bed, I listen to [Our Daily Bread](https://odb.org/), which is my excuse for not having the time to read the Bible. It helps remind me of my faith and my values, which I have found to be important in difficult times.\n\nI think another source of information I should consuming more is from talking other people. I've been trying to adopt a mindset of \"This person knows something I don't\" in social situations, and stay curious, because you can always learn something new from other people, no matter how smart you think you are.\n","data":{"title":"My Information Diet","tags":"reading, habits","date":"Apr 26, 2023"},"filePath":"information.md"},{"content":"\n> It’s always good to step back and think about how we’re using those 100 blocks we get each day.

Growing up in Malaysia and in an Asian household, you're pretty much expected to do good in school. I was also religious about ping pong, and devoted a big chunk of my primary and high school life to playing. I always had a friend who was better than me, and compared myself to him a lot.\n\nOnce I got out of high school and entered college, grades still mattered to me, but I was comparing myself with others on social qualities, i.e. how they dressed, how charismatic they were, and how many friends they had. I grew up wired to be quiet, and I sometimes wish being social and charismatic could just be a flip of a switch. I do believe once you do it more, it can become a switch, but right now I'm still at the point where forcing myself to socialize is taxing.\n\nNow, when I'm about to graduate, my focus and value system shifted more towards career and startups. I see 16 year olds on Twitter selling their startups and high school students getting internships at startups and I get incredibly envious, but moments later I get this intense drive and motivation.\n\nA [common advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtpOYxsZj7o) is to stop comparing yourself to others, especially someone you only see on the surface and to only compare yourself to the you from yesterday.\n\nBut I think you can extract some value by comparing yourself with others.\n\nIt can give you the necessary drive and fuel your motivation in times when you feel like you're in a rut.\n\nIt makes me go \"That could be me!\" and it makes be believe I can go bigger, do better.

It just depends on my perception\n\n[Robert E. Grant](https://youtu.be/1XDpa2HLXV0?t=596) shared in his TED Talk about two ways to overcome fear.\n\nFirst, practice gratitude. It's impossible to be fearful and grateful at the same time.\n\nI was amazed at how effective this is. I think this happens because fear stems from our uncertainty about the future, and gratitude helps guide us back to the present moment, allowing is to focus on the people around us, the things we have now, and how lucky we are to just be alive.\n\nThis made me recall of the idea that [a wandering mind is an unhappy one](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-wandering-mind-is-an-un/). I think letting your mind wander can cause fear.\n\nThe second way is to be intentional about your decisions.\n\nEverything that happens to you could be the best or the worst thing.

My go-to question tends to be, \"What's your major?\"\n\nBut I've come to realize posing that question is like running gradient descent with a small learning rate. It often takes a couple more questions (iterations) to really get to know that person or to get them talking (converge to global minimum).\n\nI think asking \"What are you interested in?\", gives an immediate glimpse into the person's life, revealing how they spend their time and their passions.\n\nI recently got asked what my life philosophy was, and I think that's a good question to ask. It did threw me off a bit, and made me think whether it's different from my values and principles. My answer was something along the lines of \"I want to create value, build something that provides value for humanity. I like coding and building stuff.\"\n\nAnother question is I want to start asking is \"What makes you happy?\" I think happiness is something a lot of people pursue, and you can tell a lot about a person from their answer.\n\nSome more lists of questions I found for better conversations\n\n- [Real Conversation Questions](http://jackieluo.com/questions)\n- [Questions to Ask People](https://www.calebontiveros.com/questions-to-ask-people/)\n- [Shortlist \"No Small Talk' questions (Kristen Berman)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnSo5Bg_QfLHrIiI60XJ00HxsHRvm33Yx3p3nYA6CDg/edit#gid=0)\n","data":{"title":"More Interesting Conversations","tags":"talking, questions, people","date":"Apr 22, 2023"},"filePath":"conversation.md"},{"content":"\n[Shaka Senghor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjRSek5Xbs&t=402s) gave three ingredients towards being resilient.\n\nThey are optimism, being resourceful, and memory loss.\n\nOptimism is defined as \"the quality of being full of hope and emphasizing the good parts of a situation, or a belief that something good will happen\" by the Cambridge English Dictionary.\n\nIf I apply this to GERD, optimism would look like focusing on progress, practicing gratitude and being mindful.\n\nBeing resourceful is utilizing the internet to educate myself about the DOs and DONTs, finding a support group, using tools to help better manage stress, working with healthcare professionals for a treatment plan.\n\nI especially like the idea of memory loss.\n\nI find I'm most unhappy when I replay my pre-GERD life, believing life used to be better before, and it holds me hostage. It feels like a nightmare that I'm still waiting to be woken out of.\n\nIf acceptance is the precursor to use suffering to get stronger, perhaps the precursor to acceptance is forgetting.\n\nI need to stop reliving the past, and move on.

I was at NCUR 23' and this dude had insane energy talking about his research, I could feel his energy pulsating from him. I could feel his high lingering on me afterwards.\n\nSecond, emotion travels faster than rational thought. And when we experience big changes (layoffs, breakups, death), 5 signal emotions of change arise: fear, frustration, anger, anxiety, and grief.\n\nFirst law of thermodynamics tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Rather it can be transferred, transformed, or conserved. Let's apply this to emotional energy.\n\nConverting energy means bottling it all up inside, which then manifests in stress and burnout. Transferring energy is venting out to a friend. The problem with this is you're just moving energy around from one person to another.\n\nThe power comes in transforming energy, turning signal emotions into positive ones. You can take anxiety and turn it into anticipation, fear into motivation, grief into growth, all of which becomes fuel for growth and action.\n\nHow can you do this? You need self-awareness to know these negative emotions exist, then acknowledge it, and then choosing to transform them.\n\nThat means treating your mental state like a garden. A good gardener tends to their garden, and that means doing things like self-reflection, meditation, and journalling.\n\nThey know what's festering and what needs nurturing. That means remove negative thoughts from your mind like weeds from soil. And nurturing the positive emotions, so you can reap the crop, and be who you want to be.\n","data":{"title":"The Physics of Emotions","tags":"emotions, physics","date":"Apr 20, 2023"},"filePath":"emotion-physics.md"},{"content":"\n> When you face hardship, remember that the thing itself is no misfortune at all.

I drank soju with friends on New Year's Eve and had hotpot with family at Din Tai Fung, and a couple days after, I developed [GERD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease?useskin=vector), and my life completely changed.\n\nI see GERD as a misfortune. One day I was fine, and the next I was struck by this incurable disease. It felt like a punishment that came out of nowhere, like being framed for a crime I did not commit. I always dream about going back to the past, when I was \"normal\". And this causes a lot of unhappiness.\n\nAI Marcus Aurelius said in this [podcast](https://dkbshow.substack.com/p/marcus-aurelius-podcast-interview) that to endure hardship and prevail is good fortune.\n\nIt's hard for me to accept that I have GERD. Christians say that God has a plan for everyone and my prayer will be answered at the right time, some days I feel like my messages to God are lost in the ether.\n\nIt's easy to say suffering builds endurance, and that I'm going to come out of this stronger than ever. But while you're going through that suffering, it's numbing to the brain and it's easy to succumb to what's easier, which is to continue wishing for things to be go back to the way it was, instead of accepting and acting.\n\nIt's going to take a lot of effort for sure, I mean no one said life was going to be easy.

Since data in the real-world changes over time, model performance will degrade as time passes, a phenomenon the authors called \"AI Aging\".\n\nMIT, Harvard, and other top institutions trained 4 different ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network) on 32 datasets from four industries (Healthcare, Weather, Airport Traffic, and Financial) and found that [91% of their ML models degrade over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15245-z)\n\nKey takeaway\n\n> Neither the data nor the model alone can be used to guarantee consistent predictive quality. Instead, the temporal model quality is determined by the stability of a specific model applied to the specific data at a particular time.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nThe right solution is context-dependent, and investigation should be done to understand the cause of the degradation\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1. Alert when model must be retrained: need access to latest ground truth or able to estimate model performance\n2. develop efficient and robust mechanism for automatic model retraining: (if no data quality issue or concept drift), retraining model on latest labeled data can help\n3. Have constant access to most recent ground truth: allows retraining, but in practice, ground truth is often delayed, expensive and time-consuming to newly labeled data. Alternative is to have a model catalog and use estimated performance to select best performing model\n\nMore:\n\n- https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html\n- https://www.nannyml.com/blog/6-ways-to-address-data-distribution-shift\n","data":{"title":"AI Aging","tags":"ML, mlops","date":"Apr 17, 2023"},"filePath":"ai-aging.md"},{"content":"\nWorking on this blog was hard, next.js and tailwindcss isn't easy lol.\n\nMy plan is to write something every day like I used to on https://github.com/benthecoder/til\n\nLet's see how it goes.\n","data":{"title":"Day One","tags":"writing","date":"Apr 16, 2023"},"filePath":"day-one.md"}]
