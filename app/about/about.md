# 👋 Howdy

I'm Ben. I was born and raised in [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur).

I'm currently in my senior year of B.S. in Statistics @ [ISU](https://www.iastate.edu/).

I like [hacking](https://github.com/benthecoder/hackathons) and [writing](https://benedictxneo.medium.com/).

My goal is to get into [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and have fun building something cool.

I built this [blog](https://github.com/benthecoder/blog) with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

My plan is to [write](/posts) about something everyday.

I'm obsessed with [The Great Wave off Kanagawa](/wave).
