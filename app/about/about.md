# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy

I'm Ben. I was born and raised in [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur) and am currently in my senior year of B.S. in statistics @ [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/).

I like hacking and building stuff, my goal is to be a startup founder, or just have fun building something cool with friends.

I built this blog with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/benthecoder/blog)

I also have a blog where I write about data science on [Medium](https://benedictxneo.medium.com/)

I'm also obsessed with the [Great wave of Kanagawa](/wave)
