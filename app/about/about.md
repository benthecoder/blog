# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben

I was born and raised in [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur) and am currently finishing my undergraduate studies in statistics @ Iowa State University.

I like building stuff and open-sourcing them on [GitHub](https://github.com/benthecoder).

I built this blog with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/benthecoder/blog)

I also have a blog where I write about data science on [Medium](https://benedictxneo.medium.com/)
