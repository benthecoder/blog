[{"content":"\n> Greek philosopher Epictetus: Going lame is an impediment to your leg, but not to your will.\n\nA famous [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/690806/) by Northwestern University in 1978 discovered that the happiness levels of paraplegics and lottery winners were _essentially the same_ within a year after the event occurred.\n\nOne loses their ability to walk, the other gets rich overnight. Within a year, the two were equally happy.\n\nWhy? We overestimate the impact that of extreme events will have on our lives.\n\nThis is known as the [Impact Bias](https://jamesclear.com/impact-bias), because we tend to overestimate the length or intensity of happiness that major events will create.\n\nMain takeaway: Focus on the constants in life, not on what changed.\n\nWe all die one day, there's only 24 hours in a day.\n\nRelationships have ups and downs, health isn't guaranteed.\n\nWatching the sunset at the beach and a stroll at the park is still nice.\n\nReading a good book, eating a good meal, spending time with friends and family, are all things you can still enjoy even if you go lame.\n\nThe human experience is broad and varied.\n","data":{"title":"Impact Bias","tags":"ideas","date":"Jul 25, 2023"},"filePath":"impact-bias.md"},{"content":"\nGraham Weaver shares [four ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxbVGhpEkI) to live an asymmetric life.\n\n1.

If you're going to copy something, **do it openly** instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously\n- Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work\n- **Danger to copying**: Tendency to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are\n- when you do copy something, **don't copy every feature** of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do.\n- the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.\n- One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to **copy something from one field into another**. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by **deliberately learning** about other kinds of work.\n- **Negative examples** can be as inspiring as positive ones.

For skilled players, Blackjack offers the best odds, potentially allowing professional players to win $1.50 to $3 per $100 from the casino.\n- Memorizing a basic strategy chart in Blackjack can minimize loss to around 60 cents per a hundred dollars.\n- Card counting in Blackjack involves tracking face cards and aces. More aces mean a higher chance of hitting blackjack, while more face cards increase the chance of the dealer busting.\n- The Martingale algorithm, which doubles your bet after every loss, is generally ineffective due to table limits.\n- In Craps, the follow-on bets offer even odds, allowing prolonged play without losing money.\n- In Poker, the best strategy is to be highly skilled and play against less skilled players with a lot of money to lose.\n- Roulette is generally impossible to win consistently due to the casino's edge, though some older casinos with unbalanced wheels could have exploitable biases.\n\n**Casino Policies and Technology:**\n\n- Casinos tend not to kick players out for winning, banking on the law of large numbers for eventual profit. However, if a player is identified as a professional with an edge, the casino can eject them using trespassing laws.\n- In New Jersey, casinos can't kick players out but can ruin the game for them by putting the cut cards at the front, making card counting impossible.\n- Casinos may use RFID embedded chips to track player betting and identify anomalies, possibly flagging certain players for observation.\n\n**Psychology and Gambling:**\n\n- The thrill of winning often outweighs the pain of losing for true gamblers, driving them to continue gambling.\n\n**Slot Machines:**\n\n- Slot machines are labor-efficient and major revenue generators for the casino, with adjustable odds ranging from 80% to 99% payout.\n- Progressive slot machines increase the potential payout as players lose, with optimal play possible when the bank is above a certain level.\n\n**Monte Carlo Simulation and Statistical Concepts:**\n\n- Each game has a different edge calculated through Monte Carlo simulations, where millions of hands are simulated to calculate expected wins or losses.\n- The concepts of expected value and the law of large numbers underpin casino games' outcomes, with every hand being independent, illustrating the \"hot hand fallacy.\"\n- Splitting aces and eights in Blackjack provides higher winning odds according to Monte Carlo simulations.\n","data":{"title":"Casino Odds","tags":"facts","date":"Jun 24, 2023"},"filePath":"casino-facts.md"},{"content":"\nWent to my second intern party today in Palo Alto.\n\nWe got in super early at 8:30 p.m. (party was set to start at 8).\n\nWe started playing beer pong, which I'm weirdly good at.\n\nI was a lot more comfortable at this party.\n\nI proactively reached out to people.\n\nI was better at prompting them, being curious about people, and being more relaxed.\n\nI was able to crack some jokes too, and was more natural.\n\nAt one point some friends wanted to dance, dancing still feels awkward, I don't know what to do with my hands.\n\nI met an Armenian guy from Canada and we had a lot of shared interest.\n\nWe talked about startups we want to work for, the work visa situation, and about graduate school.\n\nHe shared a vegan food startup called Climax Foods, which uses AI for food protein.\n\nIt made me realize that there are many companies outside of big tech that is doing interesting stuff, and it could be something that I enjoy and can bring meaning.\n\nI like this part about parties the most, there's so many people there that there's bound to be one person where there's a spark in the conversation.\n\nA good rule of thumb is if you feel like talking to someone, just do it.\n\nIt might lead to something meaningful, a new friendship, a new idea, a new life course.\n\nNo one remembers what you said anyways after a party, and they're probably drunk, so just go for it.\n","data":{"title":"Second Party experience","tags":"personal","date":"Jun 23, 2023"},"filePath":"party2.md"},{"content":"\nThe right question at the right time can change the course of a life, still a turbulent mind, or heal an angry heart.\n\nHere are [12 questions](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/09/12-questions-that-will-change-your-life) that should be asked many times over the course of your life, or even throughout the day.\n\n> 1.

I'd argue it is the # of **high quality teams**. A high quality team is 2-4 smart people who know each other well, have at least 1 technical founder, and are all serious about doing a startup.\n- **Startups are not a thinking game, they are a doing game**.\n  - If you don't have good startup ideas now, the way to get better ones isn't to think really hard, it's to build stuff and launch it and learn from what happens.\n  - Building and launching your own products, end-to-end, is especially important experience to have. **Building software at large companies means tweaking features of large existing products. That's a very different skill from launching your own stuff**.\n- Do it **first thing after you graduate**\n  - Why? You don't have to quit anything to do a startup when you graduate. And if it doesn't work out, it just becomes your first job.\n  - dropping out should be an edge case. only do it if you're not liking school or your project takes off.\n  - working for a few years first has a downside: it'll be harder to convince your college friends then, they'll have settled into their job or moved.\n- Startups >>> big tech\n  - choose a startup; you'll learn more relevant skills, pick up startup culture, and meet other people who are more interested in startups.\n  - more ex-Stripe founders were funded than ex-Google founders in recent YC batch, despite the fact that Google has 27 times as many employees as Stripe.\n- Apply for YC\n  - How much traction?

That's 1.3 billion tons of food that either never leaves the farm, gets lost or spoiled during distribution, or are thrown away.\n\nFood waste is an environmental issue too.\n\nWasting food = wasting energy and water it took to grow, harvest, transport, and package.\n\nAnd food that goes to landfill produces methane when it rots.\n\n6-8% of human-caused greenhouse gas can be reduced if food waste is stopped.\n\nIn the US, 32.6 million cars worth of GG emission is generated from food waste.\n","data":{"title":"Food Waste","tags":"ideas","date":"Jun 7, 2023"},"filePath":"foodwaste.md"},{"content":"\n> People change in four seasons: when they hurt enough they have to, when they see enough they are inspired to, when they learn enough that they want to, and when they receive enough that they are able to. - John C.

I rushed my parents to get to that place in time.\n\nI really loved the Antique mall. It was two floors filled with antiques owned by over 100 local dealers.

I read some poetry.\n\nIt was dinner time.\n\nSea harvest was the closest restaurant. We were cold and hungry.\n\nI got two plates of grilled seafood. We chose sea bass and salmon.\n\nIt was my first time trying sea bass. I was surprised at its richness in fats. The salmon was cooked to perfection. The rice that came with it also tasted good.\n\nIt was already 8pm, 17-mile drive can happen another day.\n\nBefore leaving, I wanted to drive along the coast.\n\nWe stopped at Perkins park and admired the wide bed of purple flowers, and the ocean crashing on the rocks.\n\nI drove further down and saw some people sitting at the beach, with a campfire in the middle.\n\nI got out and took some pictures.\n\nIt was getting dark.\n\nWe said goodbye to Monterey.\n","data":{"title":"Monterey Trip","tags":"personal","date":"Jun 3, 2023"},"filePath":"monterey.md"},{"content":"\n> 1.

There should be another layer between natural language and code generation, could be training set, prompting, a new language.\n- Compute services have a very low operating margin, 70% of it go to AWS or GCP\n- cons of consulting, you might get assigned a project that is boring, and the work never goes to production\n- in the Philippines there's an army class that you take where you march and learn how to hold a gun\n- Facebook data scientists work on mostly SQL\n- Developer advocate works on community-building, workshops, conferences, writing blogs, sometimes code, and salary can be 150k/year fresh grad, but they force you to write certain contents\n- companies start out with analytics, use snowflake, then realize they want to do machine learning, they get recommended low code ML solutions (Dataiku)\n","data":{"title":"Dinner with Kevin","tags":"personal","date":"May 23, 2023"},"filePath":"kevin.md"},{"content":"\nYou get into the office on a Monday morning, your colleague besides you asks how your weekend went.\n\nAnother colleague joins in the conversation.\n\nEveryone decides to get coffee.\n\nYou talk some more, and finally get back to your desk.\n\nYou're about continue working on a task you left unfinished last Friday, but a meeting notification pops up.\n\nYou join the meeting.

These days I'm thinking hard about who I can get lunch with.\n\nHowever, with change comes new opportunity for growth and for meeting new people. Since I no longer have the same friends that I stick with, I'm forced to go out of my comfort zone and talk to strangers.\n\nThis week, I got to meet some interns from the SWE team at the cafe, and had lunch with an intern on my team. I like talking to strangers, I never know what I can learn from them. It's like the box of chocolates saying.\n\nGrowing up in Malaysia, taking the initiative to talk to strangers does not come natural to me.\n\nIt feels like I'm going against my own nature, physically and emotionally.\n\nI tried it today, I sat down waiting for the shuttle bus, and wanted to strike up conversation with the person beside me.\n\nI was actively searching for a common ground to start a conversation. I looked at his phone, it was worn out at the edges. Do I start with, \"Hey what happened to your phone?\" What if that's too personal I thought, would it come off personal or too out-of-the-blue? I then looked at his shoes. No nothing to ask there it was regular boots. What if I directly ask what team he belongs to? No that's way to early in a conversation with a stranger to bring up.\n\nI thought about it for so long that eventually the shuttle came.\n\nIn my mind I'm thinking, because of my overthinking, I missed the opportunity to network with this person, who could've fed me a new piece of information, or connected me with another person, both of which could've changed the course of my life.\n\nI went in the shuttle, want to the very last row, and sat beside a chinese guy in his mid 20s.\n\nI've seen him before at the office.\n\nSo for 30 seconds, I sat down thinking whether I should tell him directly. I can feel my heart racing. A clock ticking down.\n\nI was thinking, \"Gosh is it too late to say it now, I've already sat down for so long, it's going to be awkward\"\n\nThen, I just decided to take the plunge.\n\n\"Hey, I think I've seen you at the office before\"\n\nHe goes \"Yea, I think so too\", and says he's at the first floor.\n\nWe start talking about the team we work for, I mentioned I was a returning intern. He started going on about how Tesla is a good company that can bring lots of opportunities, about how his friends got to other companies with Tesla on their resume.\n\nWe both connected when we shared the same frustration for the IT department, and how messy things are.\n\nAt the end of our conversation, I found out his name was Ben too, like me. We both were animated and exchanged contacts.\n\nI left the shuttle smiling.\n\nI love the moments where you can connect with another person, when both parties have something to relate to, and surprising little moments like having the same name.\n\nI aim to focus less on the anxiety of the infinite amount of possibilities from talking to strangers, and more on the opportunity of making genuine connections.\n\nHopefully by the end of the summer, I'll be more comfortable with serendipitous conversations with strangers.\n","data":{"title":"Talking to Strangers","tags":"personal","date":"May 19, 2023"},"filePath":"strangers.md"},{"content":"\nI came back to my airbnb after walking 30 minutes from a bus stop and saw a car parked out.\n\nSomeone must be moving in I thought, I was intrigued yet dreaded to find out who it was.\n\nTo my surprise it was a middle age lady in one of the empty rooms taking pictures.\n\nIt was the airbnb host.\n\nShe had a kind smile, and spoke english with an accent.\n\nShe asked where I stayed and I told her upstairs, A3.

(not common to see a property that returns complex data structures)\n\nThere's more to properties, you can make attributes read only by adding an underscore in front of variables to hide them, and create properties for them.\n\nThere's also property setters and deleters, which let's you directly assign attributes and to clean up other attributes that are auxiliary to the main property attribute.\n\nAlso @property apparently isn't a decorator, but a [descriptor](https://tushar.lol/post/descriptors/), which lets you customize the behavior getter/setter/deleter methods.\n\nThat's all for today.\n","data":{"title":"@property in Python","tags":"python","date":"May 16, 2023"},"filePath":"property.md"},{"content":"\nIt was my second time trying out golfing at Top Golf today.\n\nI hit ~80 shots, and only a handful were good.\n\nTowards the end, my hands were starting to sore and all my shots were bad.\n\nYou need a firm grip and a stable swing, and I don't think my arms are strong enough, my golf club kept moving around.\n\nI also think I'm not tall enough. I was using the hybrid club and had to hold it in an awkward position, and it kept hitting my arm.\n\n_Update: It's the day after I wrote this and arms and shoulders are sore and my grip is weak._\n\nSome good tips I got for golfing are:\n\n- don't look where the ball goes as you're hitting it\n- bend your knees, loosen your shoulders and relax, I found taking a breath before each shot helped\n- bend your club towards where you want to hit, it helps direct the shot\n- don't charge for the shot at the start and hit like an axe, it should be a single circular motion that flows like water\n- focus on your grip and stance, then work on other things\n- focus on hitting the bottom of the ball\n\nHere's what each club does in golf\n\n## Woods\n\n> 1W - your main driver...typical loft is 9 degrees up to 15. These used to be actual wood, but now are getting more bulky, and are all metal.\n>\n> 3W - your fairway driver...hard club to master. Used for long par 4s or par 5 second shots.\n>\n> 5W - lofted to around 16-19 degrees. Can be used in the rough, hits a little shorter than > your 3W, and has a more shallow swingplane.\n\n## Hybrids\n\n> These are clubs that will look and feel like a hybrid between an iron and wood. They have no cavity back (empty back like an iron), but stand straighter up at address and have more loft. Hybrids have the same lofts as many of the irons, but give more consistency, strength, and ease of hitting the ball in the air than their iron counterpart. They are popular for hitting out of rough because of their ability to slide into the ball and not catch the grass behind the ball (this causes a flyer or a ball hit further than needed with little spin because the grass covers the grooves). They are also popular for seniors or women, but not exclusively. Kind of cool clubs and relatively new.\n\n## Irons\n\n> 1 - nobody can hit this. Not even God. Don't know why I'm even including it.\n>\n> 2-4 - your long irons. Shallow face, not as much loft. You can hit these farther, and with > less backspin. They are typically used for distances on the fairway, anywhere from 180-240 to the green.\n>\n> 5-8 - your mid irons. More loft, used to hit from 130-180 yards out from the green. More > spin, and higher trajectory.\n>\n> 9, PW, GW, AW, SW - your short irons and wedges. 9 iron and PW are your clubs from 130 in. > Gap wedge is a wedge between your pitching and sand wedges. Auxiliary is a specialty wedge > that you could honestly make any loft. Sand wedge is for bunkers, or if you feel > comfortable with it, chipping and flop shots.\n\n## Putter\n\n> No explanation necessary, although there are different types of putters. An offset (referring to where the shaft meets the head) teardrop (shape) putter is a popular one.\n","data":{"title":"Golfing Experience","tags":"personal","date":"May 15, 2023"},"filePath":"golf.md"},{"content":"\nIn classification problems, there's a tradeoff between precision and recall.\n\nIf you forgot what precision and recall are, here's a good [analogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/qdai89/i_just_explained_recallprecision_to_a_nonds_and/) to recap.\n\nLet's say you're fishing with a huge net. You cast it and catch 80 fishes out of the 100. That's 80% recall. However, you also catch 80 rocks in the process, that's 50% precision.\n\nYou can use a smaller net, and target a pocket of the lake with only fish and no rocks, but you only get 20 of the fish, but no rocks. That's 20% recall and 100% precision.\n\nGet the idea?\n\nRecall = what proportion of the things you catch are actually fish (true). (ex1: 80 / 100)\n\nPrecision = of those you catch, what proportion are fish. (ex1: 80 / 80 + 80)\n\nTo balance between these two metrics, we optimize the [F1 score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score), which is their [harmonic mean](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Harmonic_mean).\n\nHowever, in some cases, precision would be more important than recall, and vice versa.\n\nHere's where the [F Beta](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/F-score#F%CE%B2_score) scofe comes in handy.\n\nWe can adjust the value of Beta to assign higher weight to either precision or recall.\n\nBelow is a [toy example](https://github.com/MenaWANG/ML_toy_examples/blob/main/modeling%20algorithm/metrics-fbeta.ipynb).\n\n```py\nfrom sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score\n\n# define two models\ny_true           = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # half positive\ny_pred_precision = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # perfect precision, two false negatives\ny_pred_recall    = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] # perfect recall, three false positives\n\nperfect_precision = [y_true, y_pred_precision]\nperfect_recall    = [y_true, y_pred_recall]\n\n# the two models score similarly when beta = 1\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=1))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=1))\n\n# higher perfect precision scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=0.5))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=0.5))\n\n# higher perfect recall scores\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_precision, beta=2))\nprint(fbeta_score(*perfect_recall, beta=2))\n\n```\n\nThe [beta parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) determines the weight of recall in the combined score.\n\nbeta < 1 lends more weight to precision, while beta > 1 favors recall (beta -> 0 considers only precision, beta -> +inf only recall).\n","data":{"title":"F-beta score","tags":"machine-learning","date":"May 14, 2023"},"filePath":"fbeta.md"},{"content":"\nI flew from Iowa to San Jose today.\n\nWith time on my hands, and the state of flow that being on a plane induces, I finally got around to my queue on [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) and read a couple of interesting articles which I'm going to list here.\n\nThere are a lot of great ideas here, especially the ones under life and career.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler\n\nSome notes on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qKv5TBaOA) on essential coding topics to help me become a better programmer.\n\n## #1 Not using programming standards\n\nThere are [conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) to follow in writing code such as whitespacing, file structure, and naming to make code consistent and readable.\n\nIt's especially important when working with other people, as it allows everyone to rely on shared expectations.\n\nNot keeping standards is like switching fonts all the time, you can still read it but the differences can throw people off.\n\n## #2 Not learning programming principles\n\nProgramming [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_principles) guide you into becoming a better programmer. They're like raw philosophies of code.\n\n[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) is an acronym for five design principles intended to make OOP more maintainable.\n\n- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle\n  - aim to break code down into modules of one responsibility each, it's more code, but you can test it more cleanly and use parts of it elsewhere\n- **O**pen/Closed Principle\n  - design modules to be able to add new functionality in the future without making changes to them, extending but never modify directly\n- **L**iskov Substitution Principle\n  - only extend modules when it's still the same type at heart, if not, create its own type\n- **I**nterface Segregation Principle\n  - modules shouldn't need to know about functionality they don't use, split modules into smaller abstractions like interfaces, is useful when testing as it allows us to mock out only the functionality that each module needs\n- **D**ependency Inversion Principle\n  - code should communicate with each other abstractly through interfaces, allows for swapping parts of code\n\nCombining these principles ends up decoupling your code, which gives you modules that are independent of each other, making code maintainable, reusable, scalable and testable.\n\n## #3 Not using programming design patterns\n\n[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) give real solution to code problems, but they aren't fixed implementations.\n\nThey're used to architect software solutions, matching the right shapes to fit the needs our software has.\n\nTHere are [three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns#Patterns_by_type) main types\n\n1. Creational patterns - make and control new object instances i.e. factory pattern\n2. Structural patterns - how we organize and manipulate objects i.e. adapter pattern\n3. Behavioral Patterns - how code functions and how it communicates with other parts of the code, i.e. observer pattern.\n\nThese patterns are used in big corporations, and creates a universal vocabulary of programming.\n\n## #4 Bad naming\n\nBad variable naming makes code hard to interpret.\n\nHere are some fixes\n\n1. Avoid encoding - remove type information in variable\n2. Expand abbreviation - expand to full name to avoid miscommunication\n3. Use clear distinction - use names that more accurately represent nuances in code\n4. Replace \"magic\" values - define as named constants, clarifies significance and keeps things in sync if used elsewhere\n5. Be descriptive with names - find balance between clear enough without being verbose\n\n## #5 Not testing code\n\nWriting test can be difficult when code is not properly architected.\n\nAt the high level, there's end-to-end testing, which lets you test code as the end user.\n\nAny spaghetti code can be e2e tested since it doesn't really touch the code, but only what it delivers. It's also more tricky to setup since it requires a fully functional application running.\n\nAt the lower-level are unit tests that verify the operations of modules in isolation, and integration test that examines how modules interact with each other.\n\nApplying SOLID principles makes testing easier.\n\n## #6 Bad time management\n\nTime estimation is hard.\n\nRule of thumb is to 2x or 3x initial time estimate for a task.\n\nAccount for unknown problems along the way.\n\nRemember that creation goes hand-in-hand in problems.\n\nIt's better to overestimate schedule than underestimate it.\n\n## #7 Rushing\n\nThings can feel great when blazing through projects, there's a place for that in prototypes.\n\nBut if this is a long-term project, take your time and think things through from day-one.\n\nIt can give a better foundation to work from and avoid code debt.\n\nOvertime, you'll be saving time from batting decisions with no easy fix because of poor architecture.\n","data":{"title":"7 Deadly Sins of Programming","tags":"programming","date":"May 12, 2023"},"filePath":"sins.md"},{"content":"\nI had a 30-min chat today with [Stefan Mai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanmai/), who's been at Amazon and Meta for 10 years.\n\nHere are some questions I asked and his response (poorly paraphrased from what I can recall).\n\n**How to pivot from data analytics to SWE?**\n\n> Frame your resume, tell the right stories. If you collected data, built pipelines, build a product, shipped something, write it all down in your resume.\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out? What do you look for when you hire?**\n\n> A lot of candidates look the same in coding tests. We look more at what they do outside of class, open source projects. There are some people who just have the love for building something, creating products that makes then stand out. These are the people that have deep knowledge about a certain thing, and having a conversation with them you can get signals that they've done a lot of shit.\n\n**What are some common mistakes candidates make?**\n\n> Nerves during interviews. Giving up on a problem at 0, and not trying to solve till 50% or 80%. Not asking edge cases when starting out in interview, which brings up a lot of issues later in your code. Advice is to just take a deep breath before each question. Calm down.\n\n**Were there key decisions or actions you took early in your career that contributed most to your success?**\n\n> It was small changes that eventually led me to where I am. I started out in consulting doing SWE, and I wanted to get into ML. I wanted to get into big tech to learn from great people. Just be sure rate of learning is positive. The industry is fast-paced and you have to be learning constantly.\n\n**Thoughts on Gen AI and how it impacts career?**\n\n> in every hype cycle of AI and ML people make a lot of predictions about what's going to happen, but things end up being the same. Things are definitely going to be different, it's going to be like the internet boom where a lot of business started making websites, APIs, etc. it'll happen with Gen AI as well. For ML, there's less focus on the data acquisition and training models, more on fine-tuning. For SWE, CRUD apps in webdev are going to go away, you can build basic websites with english now, although there are complexities with web dev now. So focus on the fundamentals and just pursue what you're interested in.\n\n**Culture difference in Amazon vs Meta?**\n\n> Amazon operates on a small margin, and it's very process-based. They're focused on how to optimize and improve their operations and processes. It also has a hierarchy where each team is siloed and you don't get access to what other teams are doing. They do have an annual ML conference where it's like academia, they have posters presenting their research. Meta operates on a high margin, they have more money to burn on new things. It's also very unstructured, you won't find documentation for something you need, so you'll be going across teams to get answers. Meta also values emotional intelligence. It's a big company, so experience is very team dependent.\n\n**What would you tell your younger self before starting a company?**\n\n> To start sooner. I wanted to start a company when I was your age, and wanted to get some experience from big tech. For some time I thought I didn't have enough experience yet or wasn't a good enough leader to start my own company. But now I believe 2-3 years is enough at a big tech and it can teach almost everything you need to know to found your own company. But working at big tech for so long did give me the financial ability to pursue my ventures now.\n\nSome mistakes:\n\n- felt intimidating talking to him right off the bat, I could tell he was really intelligent and articulate, everything he said was dense and rich in information.\n- I felt like I was asking really cliche and basic questions, and was thinking about better questions to ask midway, which made me lose focus about he was saying.\n- I was saying \"that's a good answer/point\", \"thank you for the insights\", but had nothing to respond back to or add on to what he said. I was also optimizing to ask as many questions as possible, but I need a less awkward way to respond back.\n- I was not confident in asking questions, I was hesitant and incoherent instead of being direct and clear.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n- Treat coffee chats as a conversation with a friend.\n- I should follow up on their response so I can latch on to something, give it time to digest and form structure.\n- I should do more research and ask questions that are high-value and specific to the person, my questions were too generic.\n\nI found this collection of interviews with ML practitioners on [ApplyingML](https://applyingml.com/mentors/) with some good questions and might be using some of these for my future coffee chats.\n","data":{"title":"Coffee chat with Stefan Mai","tags":"AI","date":"May 11, 2023"},"filePath":"stefan.md"},{"content":"\nFinished my finals today and thought about dumping some thoughts on exams.\n\nIn Malaysia, there's this big test at the end of senior year of high school that everyone (in the national curriculum) takes before entering college. It's called [Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sijil_Pelajaran_Malaysia) (SPM), or the Malaysian Certificate of Education.\n\nI took 10 subjects in the examination, and I remember the insane amount of effort that went into it. Our teachers for each course would provide past year papers with the answers, and our objective was to complete all of them.\n\nI had fun doing them, but it was a complete waste of time and energy. Instead of learning a useful skill, I was learning how to solve for x, without thinking **why** I had to solve for x in the first place.\n\nI did the exams, I got straight As, but what did I achieve? Was I just supposed to be this machine that was fed all that information and dump it all out?\n\nNow that I'm in university, I still feel that way about exams. But with more appreciation about both the good and bad of exams.\n\nWhat I like about exams:\n\n- studying with friends, going through something difficult together bonds us\n- a good way to make new friends, sharing practice questions, teaching them\n- teaches you how to consume and compress a lot of information in a short time\n- tests your understanding, but dependent on how much effort and care the lecture puts into making the questions\n- exam feels like a search problem, where the potential questions are a subset of the possible information covered in the course, also feels game theory like where you try to predict what kind of questions would the professor test us on.\n- as I take higher level classes, my exams has overlapping concepts, and I start to realize how the puzzle pieces connect together.\n\nWhat I don't like about exams:\n\n- doing well gives me false idea of knowing the content. I can get an A in the class but still not be able to **really** understand what's going on\n- puts me on a number line, directly comparing me with others, getting bad grades makes me feel like a failure.\n- anxiety-inducing and high pressure, my parents are paying a lot of money take courses as an international student, so I'm pressured to do well.\n- you're working in a vacuum and forced to work with what you have in your head, without any access to resources, which is unrealistic in the real-world.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n- I forget a lot from my previous classes because I don't apply information I've learned\n- I don't understand a class because I didn't seek to understand it in the first place, necessity is the impetus for learning, and I could never connect the information in my classes to something I can practically use at the time I was learning it.\n- I overthink a lot in exams, and when I overthink, I tend to change my mind about answers that were already correct, so I should pay attention to my first intuitions more.\n- the belief that you're not good at something is powerful, my inner thoughts when I face a problem I can't solve is \"I don't know this\", \"I'm screwed\", and it makes me give up really fast, clouds my judgement, and turns an easy problem into a complex one.\n","data":{"title":"On exams","tags":"personal","date":"May 10, 2023"},"filePath":"exams.md"},{"content":"\n> In Bayesian statistics, model parameters are random variables.\n\nI took a [Bayesian statistics](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayesian_statistics) course this semester and I think it'll be the most valuable course I'll ever be taking in my 4 year of undergraduate studies in Statistics at ISU.\n\nThere's a decay rate for knowledge that I retain for the classes I take, and it'll be the same for this course as well. But if there's one thing I want to take away from this course, it's the mindset of being a Bayesian\n\nI came across this [article](https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/bayesian-inference-from-first-principles) by Christoph Molnar, and what better way to end the chapter of this course by understanding Bayesian modelling from first principles.\n\nThe first principles view of Bayesian statistics is that model parameters are [random variables](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Random_variable).\n\nThe model here can be a simple distribution, and the parameters - the mean of a distribution, coefficients in linear regression, the correlation coefficient - are variables with their own distributions.\n\nThis notion contrasts the frequentist view of treating parameters as fixed but unknown quantities. By treating them as random variables, we acknowledge the uncertainty around their true values.\n\nWe're also, later on, able to incorporate our beliefs since we assign [probability distributions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Probability_distribution) to these parameters.\n\nSo, we've established parameters are variables.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish in Bayesian modelling?\n\nWe start with data about an event, and we want to estimate a parameter of interest (θ). This parameter can be anything from effectiveness of a drug to the click-through rate on a website.\n\nIn mathematical form, our model is estimating P(θ|X), the parameter distribution for θ given the data X.\n\nBut we can't directly estimate P(θ|X), we don't know the true values of parameters in the real-word.\n\nIt's much more natural to estimate the inverse - P(X|θ) the distribution of data given parameters.\n\nAnd here's where [Bayes' theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bayes'_theorem) come into the picture.\n\nThis theorem inverse the condition to P(X|θ), a.k.a the [likelihood function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Likelihood_function).\n\nFrom this theorem, we are given two things: P(θ), the prior distribution and P(X), the evidence.\n\nP(θ) is your beliefs about the world. You have to specify this BEFORE observing the data.\n\nThis prior can be informative or non-informative, and that determines how much your belief will influence the estimation. A non-informative prior means the data has more influence, and vice versa.\n\nIn statistics jargon, the posterior mean is the weighted average between the prior mean and the sample mean.\n\nThe cool thing being Bayesian is once you get an estimation P(θ|X), with the power of sequential updating, that becomes your new prior.\n\nThis idea of updating your priors is very intuitive, we're collecting new data and updating our beliefs from our interactions and experiences in everyday life.\n\nBayes' theorem also involves the term P(X) called the evidence, which is usually unfeasible to estimate. It's also known as the normalizing constant.\n\nSo instead we take the numerator P(X|θ) P(θ), which is proportional to the posterior distribution.\n\nIn most cases, the posterior distribution is not a known distribution like the Normal or Binomial distribution, so we need to perform sampling from the posterior using techniques such as [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo?useskin=vector).\n\nThere's no use to knowing all this without being able to apply it. So my goal is read [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) and learn [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) to put this knowledge into practice.\n","data":{"title":"A Bayesian mindset","tags":"statistics","date":"May 9, 2023"},"filePath":"bayesian.md"},{"content":"\n> Luke 1:1–4 (NIV): Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\n\nIn the New Testaments, we have four [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.\n\nAll of them tell the same story about the life of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus).\n\nThough the four books have many similarities, each author presents a unique perspective on Jesus, emphasizing a different theme for an intended audience.\n\n**Matthew** wrote mainly for Jews, emphasizing that Jesus, the son of David, was the Messiah for whom they were waiting. That’s why he began with a genealogy and includes multiple references to Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Jesus.\n\n**Mark** emphasizes Jesus as the Suffering Servant of God. This was especially relevant to believers in Jesus who were suffering for their faith.\n\n**Luke** was written to Theophilus, a gentile.

I think I'll enjoy it a lot. The craft and detail that goes into taking each shot, and the adventure in choosing the right camera and roll of film.\n\nI watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax4Yn16Rw8s) and got to learn a little but more about film photography.\n\nFirst, **how does film work**?\n\nThe basic idea is that film is a roll of plastic containing a magical mix of chemicals that make it sensitive to light.\n\nWhen film is placed into the camera, it lives in complete darkness.\n\nEvery time you shoot a photo, you let light in through the lense. That light then hits the film, and burns it in a way that shapes and color are reflected on the material.\n\nThe second question is **which camera** to choose.\n\nThere are 3 main types of film cameras:\n\n1. SLR (single-lens reflex camera)\n   - what you see on the viewfinder is very close to the image (thanks to mirror)\n   - option to change lenses and shoot manually\n   - bulkier and heavier\n   - who? action photography\n2. Rangefinder\n   - a different type of viewfinder that has framelines that assist you when shooting\n   - not all of them allow you to change the lens (the ones that do are more expensive)\n   - compact, smaller setup\n   - who? street photography\n3. Point & shoot\n   - automatic cameras, no need to set exposure or focus (depending on camera)\n   - require batteries\n   - who? easily capture moments of everyday life (first two requires precision and time)\n\nWhen choosing a **type of film**, there are two variables: style and price.\n\nAnd these films differ in color and contrast.\n\nFor beginners, go with Kodak GOLD 200 (cheapish color film)\n\nNow for **how to shoot**.\n\nWhen shooting film, exposure matters.\n\nOpposite from digital shooting, details in film are harder to recover from the shadows and easier from highlights. So, it's important to expose correctly or slightly overexposed, which means using a light meter.\n","data":{"title":"Film photography 101","tags":"photography","date":"May 7, 2023"},"filePath":"film.md"},{"content":"\n> In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.\n\nI had a practice session today for Sunday's praise and worship, and in one of the songs, the lead singer requested a key change.\n\nKey changes mess up my flow, because I memorize a certain routine to minimize mistakes while playing.\n\nIt was just a simple one-step key change, from C to B-flat, so I could still manage.\n\nI was looking at every chord in the old key on my printed sheet music, and then translating it to the new key in real time.\n\nBut at one point, my visual stimuli of seeing the C chord won over my brain's background process that was telling my hands to play B-flat, causing me to hit the wrong chords.\n\nI thought about why that happens and it turns out I was experiencing the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).\n\nYou've probably experienced this effect yourself in a certain brain teaser.\n\nKnown as the Stroop test, you're given a list of words that are printed in a different color than the meaning of the word. And your task is to name the color of the word, not the word itself, as fast as you can.\n\nFor example, when presented with the word \"[Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw)\", it's easier to say red, as opposed to the color of the text (blue).\n\nThere are some [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Theories) used to explain why this effect happens.\n\nThey're all based on the idea that our brains processes relevant and irrelevant information in parallel, but they both \"race\" to your brain's central processor to be chosen as a response.\n\nThis neurophysiological test has different [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Variations), and can reveal a lot about your brain and how it processes information.\n\nAmong the most important uses is in measuring a person's [selective attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27437-001) capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.\n\nIt can also diagnose different psychiatric and neurological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that studying this effect might help us better understand the black box that is our brain, which can allow us to overcome our fast instinctual thinking, known as System 1 in the book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow?useskin=vector), helping us reach to more logical conclusions.\n","data":{"title":"Stroop effect","tags":"ideas, neuroscience","date":"May 6, 2023"},"filePath":"stroop.md"},{"content":"\nI used to squeeze my to-do list with a lot of tasks, I felt I should spend every minute of my day efficiently.

And for P3 tasks, save them for when your energy levels are at its lowest, since you can perform them on autopilot mode.\n","data":{"title":"Three things","tags":"productivity","date":"May 5, 2023"},"filePath":"3.md"},{"content":"\nI like listening the [Huberman lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) podcast.\n\nAndrew is really good at distilling research and studies into small bits of practical advice.\n\nThe two biggest lessons I've garnered from his podcast are to get [sunlight](https://youtu.be/WDv4AWk0J3U?t=299) exposure in the morning for ~5 minutes, and [physiological sigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc) is effective in reducing anxiety and stress.\n\nIn his [episode](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/) on goal setting and achieving goals, he shares 8 science-backed strategies.\n\nThey can be broken down into three main categories:\n\n1. **Goal Setting:** how do we set the right goals?\n   - **The 85% Rule** — you should set your goals so that you achieve them [85.13%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4) of the time (failing 15% of the time despite your best efforts)\n   - **Make A Plan** — set SMART goals, create a specific set of action steps that get right down to details about what success would look like.\n   - **Imagine The Worst** — write down/talk about how bad it will be if you don't achieve your goals, it’s motivating to think about what it will be like if you fail.\n2. **Goal Execution:** how do actually do the actions required to achieve our goals?\n   - **Outsmart Your Obstacles** — identify potential obstacles ahead of time and then planning out how to defeat them (foreshadow failure).\n   - **Procrastinate with Other Tasks** — pre-task multitasking before a work session can actually help you generate adrenaline and get you into action.\n   - **Focus Your Eyes to Focus Your Mind** — Focus your visual attention on a single point for 30-60 seconds, it increases levels of systolic blood pressure and adrenaline.\n3. **Goal Persistence:** how do we stick with our goals?\n   - **Have A Weekly Check In** — review the progress you’ve made on your goals once a week, “dopamine milestone” — a pit stop where you signal to your brain that things are moving forward.\n   - **Reward Your Effort** — the next time you make an effort on something important — take note, and then take pride.

Deconstruct the skill\n2. Learn enough to self-correct\n3. Remove practice barriers\n4. Practice at least 20 hours.\n\n**First**, decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done.\n\nIs it coding your own personal portfolio in React & Next.js? Building blazingly fast app using Rust? Creating a compiler from scratch? Be specific.\n\nSkills are just big bundles of other skills. Look into the skills you need to achieve it and deconstruct; break it down into smaller pieces.\n\nThe more you break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide what parts of the skills that will actually get you to what you want. Then practice those first.\n\nTo practice, you need reliable sources. Do some research, find 3-5 best resources. Don't use this as a way to procrastinate. Figure out the optimal stopping time for exploration, then start exploiting.\n\n**Second**, you don't have learn everything. You only need to learn enough to the point where you can practice, and self-correct as you practice.\n\nLearning is getting better at noticing when you're making a mistake, and doing something a little different every time.\n\nIn programming, that means having the ability to debug and fix errors in your code. It also means spotting opportunities to make your code more optimized.\n\n**Third**, life is full of distractions and the internet is full of noise. They get into the way of practicing.\n\nDevote time to learning. Block time out on your calendar. Set a timer and start working. Get into the flow with some music. Turn off notifications on your phone. Set website blockers.\n\n**Fourth**, we don't like to feel stupid. And when learning anything new, there's an initial frustration barrier.\n\nCommit to practicing. Learn in public. Get a study buddy. Write about what you learn.

I was at NCUR 23' and this dude had insane energy talking about his research, I could feel his energy pulsating from him. I could feel his high lingering on me afterwards.\n\nSecond, emotion travels faster than rational thought. And when we experience big changes (layoffs, breakups, death), 5 signal emotions of change arise: fear, frustration, anger, anxiety, and grief.\n\nFirst law of thermodynamics tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Rather it can be transferred, transformed, or conserved. Let's apply this to emotional energy.\n\nConverting energy means bottling it all up inside, which then manifests in stress and burnout. Transferring energy is venting out to a friend. The problem with this is you're just moving energy around from one person to another.\n\nThe power comes in transforming energy, turning signal emotions into positive ones. You can take anxiety and turn it into anticipation, fear into motivation, grief into growth, all of which becomes fuel for growth and action.\n\nHow can you do this? You need self-awareness to know these negative emotions exist, then acknowledge it, and then choosing to transform them.\n\nThat means treating your mental state like a garden. A good gardener tends to their garden, and that means doing things like self-reflection, meditation, and journalling.\n\nThey know what's festering and what needs nurturing. That means remove negative thoughts from your mind like weeds from soil. And nurturing the positive emotions, so you can reap the crop, and be who you want to be.\n","data":{"title":"The Physics of Emotions","tags":"emotions, physics","date":"Apr 20, 2023"},"filePath":"emotion-physics.md"},{"content":"\n> When you face hardship, remember that the thing itself is no misfortune at all.

We're all vulnerable and actively seeking for belonging and connection (being in a completely new place), and at the same time, willing to do anything fun and exciting (since we were in California).\n\nI'm going back this summer, and a part of me fears it will never be the same again, that I won't meet the same people I did last year.\n\nBut I know it's foolish because it all comes down to my own intentions in making new friends, stepping outside my comfort zone, and actively seeking new experiences.\n\nEven though it's going to be tiring as an introvert, it's going to be worth it.\n\nFuture me if you're reading this, stop thinking so much and just do it.\n","data":{"title":"Friendships in California","tags":"personal","date":"Apr 18, 2023"},"filePath":"making-friends.md"},{"content":"\nFound this [article](https://www.nannyml.com/blog/91-of-ml-perfomance-degrade-in-time) by NannyML and thought it would be useful for my article writing.\n\nML models depend on the data it was trained on. Since data in the real-world changes over time, model performance will degrade as time passes, a phenomenon the authors called \"AI Aging\".\n\nMIT, Harvard, and other top institutions trained 4 different ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network) on 32 datasets from four industries (Healthcare, Weather, Airport Traffic, and Financial) and found that [91% of their ML models degrade over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15245-z)\n\nKey takeaway\n\n> Neither the data nor the model alone can be used to guarantee consistent predictive quality. Instead, the temporal model quality is determined by the stability of a specific model applied to the specific data at a particular time.\n\nWhat are the solutions?\n\nThe right solution is context-dependent, and investigation should be done to understand the cause of the degradation\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1. Alert when model must be retrained: need access to latest ground truth or able to estimate model performance\n2. develop efficient and robust mechanism for automatic model retraining: (if no data quality issue or concept drift), retraining model on latest labeled data can help\n3. Have constant access to most recent ground truth: allows retraining, but in practice, ground truth is often delayed, expensive and time-consuming to newly labeled data. Alternative is to have a model catalog and use estimated performance to select best performing model\n\nMore:\n\n- https://huyenchip.com/2022/02/07/data-distribution-shifts-and-monitoring.html\n- https://www.nannyml.com/blog/6-ways-to-address-data-distribution-shift\n","data":{"title":"AI Aging","tags":"machine-learning, mlops","date":"Apr 17, 2023"},"filePath":"ai-aging.md"},{"content":"\nWorking on this blog was hard, next.js and tailwindcss isn't easy lol.\n\nMy plan is to write something every day like I used to on https://github.com/benthecoder/til\n\nLet's see how it goes.\n","data":{"title":"Day One","tags":"writing","date":"Apr 16, 2023"},"filePath":"day-one.md"}]
