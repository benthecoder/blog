got up at 9 and was so tired that i didn't want to go. i told myself i didn't do much for this hackathon anyways. took 8 and then 30 bus, got there at 11 something. ate sun chips and pretzels with two cups of coffee. met up with my friends.

went for finalist judging and the judges were bombarded with too much AI. we could've strategised better for the finalist demo.

waited till 2:45 p.m. and we didn't get any emails for finalist announcements.

saw the 10 finalist demos for the hackathon, there were workout accountability with crypto, watermarking media, DeFI, swapping crypto with ai wearables, playing games with your NFTs, disaster response with blockchain, etc.

there were over 100 slides for the prize announcements.

it was crazy to see 400k dollars distributed to the winners out of 221 [projects](https://ethglobal.com/showcase?events=sanfrancisco2024).

[deeptrust.eth](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/deeptrust-eth-6rv0v) won two prizes:

> üîí Best Use of Compute Over Private Data (Decrypting within a Lit Action) ‚∏∫ $3,000 by Lit Protocol
>
> üèÜ Innovative Applications of ZK in Deep Learning and the ETH Ecosystem ‚∏∫ $2,000 by [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/)

the biggest lessons we got out of the hackathon was we need a UI if we wanted to be finalists. and we should've just presented to more sponsors, even if we didn't use their technologies.

personally, i learned that if i took more actions or put more effort into the hackathon, things could've ended up differently. I should've played to my strengths, and focused on building a nice UI, instead of waiting to integrate with another part of the project. i had no confidence in my abilities for this project, and that impacted my contribution.

had conversations about career, relationships, friendships, parents, agency, impact on the world, malaysia, increasing surface area of luck, and also about the future of the project.

got so much swag from the hackathon, spent 30 minutes pasting stickers on my luggage while watching [leah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adm6qv468j8).

realized i've forgot most of the biblical stories and i find it hard to devote time to study the bible and grow in my faith. the goal is to read mere christianity before bed everyday, and take some [classes](https://bibleproject.com/classroom/) from the bible project every sunday.
