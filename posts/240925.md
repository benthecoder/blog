prod review presentation on the new feature. created a mini benchmark. i wrote out a script for what to say and i find that really makes me sound like a robot. and when Z commented a mistake i found i didn't know what to do and i just paused for a few seconds. i'm still learning how to be quick on my feet and think on the spot. humor and charisma is a skill that is so hard to learn for me.
