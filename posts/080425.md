i've been thinking about this [brain tumor segmentation](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64153130/wiki/630130) challenge by MICCAI 2025 lately.

i wouldn't mind doing a phd on just this topic, brain segmentation. there are new papers released every week, even days on this ai in healthcare. i want to specialize, understand this deeply. i no longer want to build or make wrappers or build apps, i want to be a researcher.

should i do a phd?
