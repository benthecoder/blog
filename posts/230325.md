went to church for my confirmation class and stayed for the chinese service. it's good to see everyone again. bought some dimsum from wong lee and went to A's house for another interview grind session. leetcode is so hard, even the easy questions. i need to solve more questions. i need to understand fundemental patterns. there's no time to understand each of them now. napped halfway on the floor. i get so tired around 4-6 pm. the rest of the night i felt anxiety again, i couldn't feel anything. i could barely eat dinner.
