i went to the library in the morning to get some studying done. i also wanted to leave the house, so i can get cherries to boost my brain power for the next few days. B came with a few of his friends from VA to get our stuff dropped out. today was move out day for W. we went to the UHaul first to pickup a van, and i drove it back to the house. it took 5 rounds of going up and down the stairs, but we moved packed everything, including a queen bed. parking it beside his apartment was a challenge, but i managed it. after everything, we went to costco to make a return, but it was closed. and we went back to the uhaul, and it was closed as well. we went back to his house and i he treated me to japanese food. i got the unagi. i love unagi. we went home together. i did more studying the rest of the night.
