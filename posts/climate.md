I've been saying I want to work in climate every time someone asks for a long time without doing anything about it. So, I'm gathering resources in this document as a first step.

I started reading [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52908942-how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster) by Bill Gates yesterday. I hope to absorb as much information as I can about this field. And reaching out and chatting with the right people.
