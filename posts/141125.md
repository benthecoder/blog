met D for the first time in person, shook his hand. he brings good energy into the whole room. a funny and serious individual.

also my first time working with teslio to get my code tested, with a deep fear that something is horribly wrong and they'll point it out and i'll be embarrassed, a stain on my track record.

A walked me through the architecture of the backend and how configs are rolled out. God bless him. i admire his work style and his sense of focus as someone who probably receives dozens of requests a day.

dinner was rooh sf again, and i'm safely in the corner again, but this time with more amiable people. couldn't eat much of the food because of my dietary restrictions.

after dinner, i shook his hand again. i think he knows me? or maybe it's just common courtesy. i want to talk to him more, but i need to grow. i need better ideas. don't go to someone like him empty minded. sure you have ideas but are they fleshed out? will it sound intelligent? or is it just a dumb shower thought? maybe i'm overthinking things.

stayed up till 3am that night to roll out my feature. each button i click i worry i will completely break the entire product.
