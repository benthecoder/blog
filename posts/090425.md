i somehow got a callback from meta for their data engineer, analytics role. a few resources i'm gathered for my preparation. i have 3 weeks at most. what i've gathered is the first round is an hour, 25 mins of python and 25 mins for sql, each has 5 questions, and you have to get at least 4 correct. the pressure is even higher for this than linkedin. if failling linkedin meant i was not good with my ai fundamentals, failing this would mean i'm bad at programming. it's as simple as that. i've realized how much prep i am lacking for these interviews, and how stressing about it and grinding for a week is not sustainable in the long term. so i'm just going to prepare in my free time, and do my best. i'm not going to put all my energy and effort and time into these anymore. if i want to work in faang, i will have time in the future. i won't die if my first job is not faang.
