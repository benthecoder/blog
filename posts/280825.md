i went to the same cafe to get my matcha fix, and took photos with my cybershot along the way. my only brief opportunity to explore the city. my brain was half awake most of the day from my odd sleeping hour. had dinner again at digg with some of the people. finding it hard to speak up and share thoughts with them. i fear everything i saw is not intelligent enough. or i was just drained and thus unable to socialize. i got to the airport in the nick of time. the boston security check was most dated i've seen. i wonder if its one of the oldest airport in america.
