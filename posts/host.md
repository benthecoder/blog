I came back to my airbnb after walking 30 minutes from a bus stop and saw a car parked out.

Someone must be moving in I thought, I was intrigued yet dreaded to find out who it was.

To my surprise it was a middle age lady with a kind smile that was in an empty room taking pictures.

It was the airbnb host.

She started speaking english with an accent, and asked where I stayed.

I told her upstairs, A3. She began explaining that she was the one communicating with me on Airbnb messaging.

I was a little embarrassed, since my first day here I was overwhelmed, so I said some things how there were 9 rooms in the apartment and I wasn't comfortable staying here.

I was about to heat up my $9 bento box from 99 ranch for dinner but saw her moving a chair into the house and I went to help her.

We got to the age-old "where you are from" question and I blurted out Mandarin once she mentioned she was from China.

I usually try to keep conversations in English. Even back at university, I wouldn't converse in mandarin with a Chinese, because it usually backfires when I fail to express myself due to my primary school level of Chinese vocabulary.

She asked if I needed anything, and I asked about the red bicycle that's been sitting the living room the past five days I have been here, untouched and unmoved.

She mentioned it was a girl's bike, but she could lend me a bike that belonged to her nephew at her house nearby.

She said to give her 20 minutes, and we can go check on the bike together.

It was already 7:30pm, and I was getting hungry, but I couldn't turn down this opportunity.

What I initially thought would be a 5 minute thing turned out to be over an hour, we went to two separate houses. After discovering the bike had a flat tire at the first house, we moved the bike to a second house to get an air pump, but the pump we found at a shed was a ball pump. So we ended up leaving the bike there, and headed back to bring me home.

In the car, I got to know her a little better.

She moved here from China with her only daughter in 2017, and has been in California since. "Time flies" she said. She's an art teacher, and that influenced her daughter to study art therapy. Apparently, there are only 42 universities that offer this. She expressed her dissatisfaction about the daughter's choice of career path, but was understanding given that's her interest.

We also talked about my major, living cost in Iowa, whether I wanted to buy a car that she was selling for 2k, about my parents visiting, what my dad does, about durian being really expensive in California (~10 dollars a pound), and $60 in China.

She asked me about layoffs and AI, and my brain translation feature of english to chinese wasn't working very well, but I think she got some idea of what I was saying.

Even though we both have completely different backgrounds and upbringing, we had a shared understanding of what it's like to be far away from home, and the struggles of starting a life somewhere new.

I like this part about Airbnbs.

You get to meet different people and realize we're all the same underneath.
