use claude code for my research paper code and for implementing chat for my blog and also for the hackathon. do i remember how to code still? interview season is coming up soon. i have to start grinding.

i found this [chicken soup recipe](https://youtu.be/CPHPNSr8mh4?si=Tt7K9hmnyV2auSmk) that i'll try next time. a good tip is to use salt and water to draw out the blood from the chicken, and to pan fry the chicken with ginger so the flavor comes out.

watched amazing spiderman with T and read judges chapter 8. spent the rest of the night trying to fix the bugs with fhir data conversion but gave up as it was midnight. i need to stop clauding stuff. it's decreasing my IQ points. i need a balance between efficiency and working smart.
