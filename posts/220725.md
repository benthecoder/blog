mostly stayed home today. spent more time building the upperroom app, and left this video playing in the background: [Does A Good Christian Tithe 10%? (It's Not That Simple)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN3wYVRkmno)

my biggest takeaway from this is: it's not about how much you should give, it's about how much you should keep. because all things belong to God.

this switch in mindset can make you be more generous, and go from a scarcity to an abundant mindset.
