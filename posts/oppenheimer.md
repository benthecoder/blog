> "The ending of the war by this means, certainly cruel, was not undertaken lightly. But I am not, as of today, confident that a better course was then open. I have not a very good answer to this question."

This is what Oppenheimer had to say about the atomic bomb from an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdtLxlttrHg) in 1965.

The 3 hour long Oppenheimer was a good history lesson about the world war and explored a lot of interesting themes.

The concepts of morality and ethics, the unintended consequences of scientific discoveries, nature of war, good and evil, ideologies, self-importance, etc.
