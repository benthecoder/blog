today was T's birthday and i didn't even have a card for her. card writing is a meaningful ritual for her, and i failed. i felt like the worst boyfriend in the world. i have so many cards at home from bookstores i visit, ready to be used, but i didn't bring any from home. i felt stupid.

the announcement was scheduled to go out tomorrow. i put all my effort into getting it ready. i reached out to the respective people, i made sure the wording was right. a curveball was thrown and it turned out my feature still had bugs i had to fix. it's not perfect yet. but i was adamant, i worked on trying to fix it by turning some knobs.

we ended up having dinner with the team together. i got to speak more with L and T got to speak with J. it was a nice time. T told me that i'm timid and i don't voice my thoughts with confidence, so that's something i have to work on. i'm embarrassingly shy when speaking with my "bosses." i think it's an asian thing.
