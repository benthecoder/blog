i went to B's talk at 10:15 a.m.

you upload slides by going into a presentation room, and there are stations for you to upload slides.

B's talk went smooth, i noticed a few things i would adjust personally, given my OCD tendencies.

we went to have lunch at shouk ($15), i had hummus and falafels. my brussel sprouts were spoiled and sour. we talked about his research work at tiktok. every minute i felt anxious about not being prepared enough. my stomach did not hold lunch well.

after the detox, we went into ballroom c. it was freezing, felt my heart pounding with anxiety while waiting for my turn. i was speaker #8. there were 9 in total.

my professor was happy with my presentation. her friends even said i would be in the top 3. i found it hard to believe.i wasn't sure how well i actually did.

i went to the apple store to buy a usbc cable to work on the research work. i started making the graphics for one of the training process.

we dinner at china chilcano, peruvian + japanese + chinese combo.

the rest of the night i had trouble figuring out when to book my flight out to austin. i was stressing out about where to stay and for how long. and finding apartments that do not have horrible reviews on management. i might be in over my head about starting so soon and relocating.
