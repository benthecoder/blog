from [I Didn't Do the Thing Today: Letting Go of Productivity Guilt by Madeleine Dore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58210932-i-didn-t-do-the-thing-today)

even if you didn't do the thing today, find something to enjoy

- enjoy the **failures** and mistakes–they're a sign we're trying
- enjoy the **unknown**–it's where we discover something new
- enjoy the **rest**, the boredom, the empty moments–that's where we find insight
- enjoy the **busy**, too–that's where we can find momentum
- enjoy the **rut**–that's where we can discover a new path
- enjoy the **wobble**–that's where we find the variances that light us up
- enjoy the **learning**–it's where we can never fail
- enjoy the **limitations**–it's where we find awe and creativity
- enjoy the **choices** we make as well as the plans that change–they're often the making of our lives
- enjoy the **comparisons** with another–it's where we find our secret joy
- enjoy the **questions**–because life would be dreary if we had all the answers
- enjoy the **doing**–because the joy is in the doing, not the done
- enjoy the **incomplete**–because that means there's more to come
- enjoy the **moments**–if we tend to them, if we get the good out of every bit of them, what a life we'll have created
