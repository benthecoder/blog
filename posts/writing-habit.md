I've been writing daily on this blog and it's built into my life right now.

I physically cannot bring myself to miss one day. Unless the world is ending, I will keep this going for as long as I am able.

I still have a lot to improve in my writing. Most days I'm just summarizing and taking notes on what I've read, not really writing anything coming straight from my mind.

Reading this article about lessons from [three years of writing online](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/three-years-of-writing-online-want), I found these writing habits that I would like to adopt:

- make time to journal every night
- try free writing (i.e. [hand-written morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/)), it's great to declutter your mind and generate ideas, and peek into your subconscious
- the shorter version of above is to do a quick 10 bullet brain dump.
- If you lack ideas, tap into your [night shift](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/working-without-working-the-creative). Go for a walk with no input (no podcast, no music), and just let your subconscious guide you. Record any ideas that arise.

He also leaves some good books about writing worth checking out:

- _On Writing_ by Stephen King
- _The Creative Act_ by Rick Rubin
- _The Writing Life_ by Annie Dillard
- _Bird by Bird_ by Anne Lamott
- _Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit_ by Steven Pressfield - (also: The War of Art)
- _The Artistâ€™s Way_ by Julia Cameron
- _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_ by George Saunders for an engaging deconstruction of some great writing
