Travelled to shenzhen from West Kowloon HK today. A few thoughts:

- I had so many dreams today, in the morning, and later in taxis and trains.
- Lightroom ios is good enough for editing film like photos
- I didn't know beef shiu mai existed
- why is forcing people to buy tea a thing
- HK people being rude is definitely a thing, it's like all of them they woke up on the wrong side of the bed
- HK -> China customs is painstakingly slow
- the bullet train was so fast it felt like 5 minutes.
- Why can't I take pictures in customs is it a security law, I got called out lol
- A young taxi driver did not help us with b ags but the old one did thought it would be reversed
- It's so hard to find a hotel here, there are three hotels named T hotel, and ended up staying in the wrong one in the end
- subway here is super cheap
- I had spicy and sour fish and I loved it, I think my body is beginning to accept it.
- came to a more suburb part of shenzhen and it felt like Taiwan it was peaceful, I saw this nice street with a lot of trees, and old people with small kids holding hands
- Motorcycles here are electric, very quiet and dangerous as they go on the sidewalks
- Diaphragm crams are so scary I felt like I was gonna die, I had one that lasted 20 minutes at this lanzhou noodles restaurant after eating some sour and spicy food and am now afraid
- Saw a corgi poop on the subway tunnels
- Shopping malls are mostly catered for females where are the clothing stores for men
- It would be cool if I could read greek
- Xiaomi is apple in China?
- Xiaomi 14 ultra has 140x zoom that's crazy
- Getting a fold phone would actually be useful I can read blogs on a bigger screen, but too heavy though ill yet 5 more years
- My respect for a mall goes up 100% if it has a bookstore, and a cat store
- Chinese book covers are nicer for some reason
- wish I can read a chinese book without feeling like I'm doing a test
- I wanna sit in a bookstore all day
- Wow they made Ghibli into books
- How do people internet in China i cant dont know how to use the internet at all without a vpn
