the last day of gtc was a slow day. i mostly spent time with the hp ambassadors. they're a fun group, and i got to pick up some hindi. we went to hinodeya, i ordered a pork bowl cause it was the cheapest. i took the uber with them back to sf, and napped a lot on the way. had hotpot with j and n at hotpot champ till 1 am.
