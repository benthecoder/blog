Not all fun is created equal.

According to Peter, there are [3 types of fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale).

**Type 1 Fun** is enjoyable while it's happening. It's known as simply, fun. Good food, margaritas, sport climbing.

**Type II fun** is misrable while it's happening, but fun in retrospect. It starts with the best intentions, and things get carried away. Think ultramarathons, ice climbing, biking across the country. It's the experiences that starts with "I regret this so much" but ends with "Ya know, that wasn't so bad, let's do more of this."

**Type III fun** is not fun at all. Not even in retrospect. Where you think "What in the world was I doing?"

I want to optimize for more Type II fun. The most recent Type II fun experience I had was hiking Upper Yosemite falls. The climb was brutal but the feeling upon reaching the top was unforgettable.
