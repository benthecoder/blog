after many weekends filled with work, i had the rare opportunity to take a break. i'm back in sf, and i visited a few spots i love.

i started the day at the farmers market at the ferry building, then went to chinatown. i met V at rice roll express, one of the best cheap cantonese meal spots. it reminds me a lot of taiwan and HK, except it's 6x the price. W came later to meet up with us, and we decided to do something fun. i wanted to go to the coast, but W had a better idea to go golfing. i was hesitant at first, but optimizing for fun is always a good idea to minimize regrets. we arrived at presidio golf course, and the driving range was 100 balls for $16 and $10 for rental clubs. that was not bad for SF. i expected the price to be exaggerated given we're in presidio.

at night W and i had dinner at Cha-ya, a vegan restaurant. because of my braces treatment, i had to ask the waitress to give me scissors, and i think they just grabbed one that was used to cut vegetables, which was funny.

we went to best buy to get a ps5 controller to play cyberpunk on my hp laptop that's been sitting at his apartment for months. we also called A and V to catch up.
