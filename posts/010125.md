> Fall in love. It’s easy to fall in love with people. I suggest falling in love with anything and everything. Every chance you get. Fall in love with your coffee, your sneakers, your blue zone parking space.
>
> I’ve had a lot of fun in life. Falling in love with stupid, meaningless physical objects… I have truly spent my life focusing on the smallest things imaginable, completely oblivious to all the big issues of living.
>
> The only two things you ever need to pay attention to in life are work and love. Things that are self justified in the experience and who cares about the result. Stop rushing to what you perceive as some valuable endpoint. Learn to enjoy the expenditure of energy that may or may not be on the correct path.

woke up at 11. decluttered my safari tabs. wrote my goals for 2025. watched a bit of before midnight.

i love the dinner scene they had in greece, the conversations are so natural. it feels like you're just sitting with them at the table, no script, just a bunch of friends gathered together. i loved this quote the most.

> “...like a sunrise or sunset,
> anything so ephemeral. Just like
> our life - we appear and we disappear
> and we are so important to some,
> but, we are just passing through.”

the fight scene was so real as well. it's a realistic depiction of how complicated life can get, and how that can get in the way of two people trying to love one another. it felt uncomfortable watching it, something so personal and raw. their acting is incredible.

looked into some healthcare companies in SF. discovered abridge ai. i have to start figuring out what i want to do after i graduate. what would excite me, bring me joy. i might have to start leetcoding as well. and memorizing some stats and ML. but i know that if i keep working on my projects with ucsf, the learnings that i do in the process will all pay off. i just have to make sure i'm truly learning, and focus on the details. and not hand everything to AI, and develop my own chain of reasoning. just keep staying curious and iterating.
