- john muir trail + vernal falls
- 15.6 km hike
- seeing Chinese people and hearing chinese on the trails gives me so much comfort
- held a gallon of water in most of the hikes so i dont skip arms day
- i saw a group of abcs hiking and there was a part of me that wished i was with them, but i realize being with a diverse group that you never had control over has the highest chance of serendipity and learning something new about culture and language, lifestyle and values, breaks me out of my usual bubble and makes me realize the world is much bigger
- i notice my energy doesnt deplete when i hike, it goes up, the more i go, the more energetic i am, maybe i could hike half
- taco tuesday
- first time playing never have i ever game
- drinking games
- seltzer is bad
- scotch whiskey and coke is good
- mario kart and mario party

[its okay to care too much](https://open.substack.com/pub/ava/p/its-okay-to-care-too-much) - Ava

- you can guide where your attention falls but you cant change what you care about. acceptance is what finally allows you to move on
- the problem with caring too much is that no one is truly accountable for your pain. their lack of reciprocity doesnt make them a bad person, and your expectations of it doesn't make you one either
- giving other people permission to be the way they are is a sign that you give yourself permission to be the person you are
- caring too much is the key to everything good in life
- dont numb yourself because caring is painful. your capacity for sensitivity and commitment is the best thing about you
