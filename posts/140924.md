spent the entire sat just preparing for wednesday.

glad that the three of us are in this together. no matter the outcome. it's about the journey.

so many variables and unknowns. 20 minutes is all it takes to change everything.

been trying to see this less as a "get this or I'm worthless" situation, and more of a "this is an exciting opportunity". i've been submitting to God and trusting that He has a path for me.

whenever something big is coming up, it feels like every second and hour leading up to that moment matters. and i will regret it and blame myself for not trying hard enough if I don't use my time well. and life after that moment is all a blur, who knows what will happen after?

there's only so much variability you can account for, questions you can predict. at some point, you just have to let go and trust that what you're doing is enough.
