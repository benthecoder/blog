I was wondering today about why and how music can influence my emotions a lot.

I could be in a neutral state. But once I listen to songs that are sad/happy/relaxing/exciting, I unconsciously mimic those emotions. Some subtle like transpiration of water through a plant from the roots to the leaves, others like an ice cold shower or an electric shock to my brain. It happens so automatically that I find it very alarming, intriguing, and practical.

So I did a search and started reading this wikipedia page: [Music and Emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_emotion).

Here are some things interesting insights.

- music is good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood (motherly singing as a way to relay emotional messages), may play a role in [identify formation](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10298649020050S103)
- children at age of 4 are able to distinguish emotions in music in ways similar to adults
- People high in agreeableness have higher emotional responses to music in general
  - Stronger sad feelings have been associated with people high in agreeableness and neuroticism
- previous exposure to music [can affect](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/124/5/1488/72119/Impact-of-Music-Music-Lyrics-and-Music-Videos-on?autologincheck=redirected) later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions
- why people listen to sad music?
  - to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for [cognitive reappraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reappraisal), to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement
- familiarity with a piece of music [increases](https://doi.org/10.1525%2FMP.2010.27.3.177) the emotions experienced by the listener
- Emotional memories & actions
  - Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness.
  - Music is processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it **impervious to later memory distortions**
  - Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight
  - many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed
- In Juslin and Västfjäll's [BRECVEM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_emotion?useskin=vector#Juslin_and_V%C3%A4stfj%C3%A4ll's_BRECVEM_model).
  - **evaluative conditioning**: a piece of music paired repeatedly with a positive or negative stimuli
    - ex: playing a piece of music every time you meet your best friend. This music can evoke happiness even in the absence of the interaction.
  - **emotional contagion**: a listener perceives the emotional expression in a song, then 'mimics' the expression internally, inducing the same emotion.
  - **visual imagery**: listener conjures up visual images while listening to music (a beautiful landscape)
  - **episodic memory**: music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. Referred to as "Darling , they're playing our tune" phenomenon.

After discovering this, I find [music psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_psychology?useskin=vector) and [music therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy) to be super interesting. I want to talk to people who are in this field.

Adding the following books to my reading list:

- [This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel J. Levitin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141565.This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Music)
- [Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain by Oliver Sacks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1297985.Musicophilia)
- [Music, The Brain, And Ecstasy: How Music Captures Our Imagination by Robert Jourdain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141566.Music_The_Brain_And_Ecstasy)

If you want to go even deeper into this topic, read books by Barbara and Bruscia.
