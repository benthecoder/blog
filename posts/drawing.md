> Drawing, like music and dance, needs to be taught and practised throughout an artist's life. It is my firm belief that drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world and that using the most limited of means can lead to the most beautiful results. Furthermore, I am certain that drawing from observation is a central element of success across a broad scope of practice - from architecture, design, fashion and engineering, to tilm, animation and the wider creative industries.

I read this quote while flipping through the pages of the book [Ways of Drawing: Artists' Perspectives and Practices by The Royal Drawing School](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43785839) at Tsutaya bookstore in Pavilion Bukit Jalil.

It's a beautiful book with a wealth of drawings, prints, and paintings by established artists past and present. It covers the various techniques, approaches, and philosophies behind the art of drawing, and explores elements of drawing, such as line, tone, and composition.

I loved the "In Practice" section which has activities ranging from a recipe for making oak-gall ink to ideas for drawing from poetry.
