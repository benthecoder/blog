my throat started to itch around the evening, and i was convinced by W to take his throat medicine. which i later only found out were steroids.

i went to bed at 11:30 to get up early to pack. but i couldn't get deep sleep till 2:30. i decided to get up at 3 and packed until 5 a.m. T was with me throughout the packing. it's peaceful in the wee hours. but i had to do it as quiet as possible. so i don't disturb the people below me.

i was mad at W. i slept at 530

i then woke up at 830. and i had breakfast with mafia at sisteria near my apartment. i had beets salad.

adrian drove me to the airport.

i flew united. the food was terrible. but i did get some sleep.
