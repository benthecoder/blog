5 bucks oat milk latte to keep me functioning for the day. DSA class is just 7 classes with 3 homeworks, 1 final exam, and one final project. thinking of using cuGraph by nvidia for a graph analysis project. i can also see myself learning something useful for leetcode interviews in the upcoming months. i should take notes and start creating a system for acing lc.

distributed computing was just pyspark. why not just use ray for all distributed stuff? is spark and ray essentially the same thing? one is just packaged into a product?

day 1 of [eth global sf](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024#venue) hackathon. so new to the web3 world. talked to a bunch of companies, got swags, ideated with claude by dumping the entire list of sponsors into it, did this until 2 something, took a waymo home at 3am, slept at 4.
