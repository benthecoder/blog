woke up 11am after a long sleep.

for lunch i got chiken teriyaki ($15) from momiji, which in japanese means maple leaves or autumn foliage, also the act of viewing autumn leaves.

then went to aapm and watched a talk on AI in radiology talk.

then went to the MLK library to get more research work done.

then it was time for the award ceremony. i met up with my professor again and she thinks i have a good chance. i choose to have no expectations whatsoever to avoid disappointments

the award ceremony was a solid 2 hours. halfway i was deciding if i should put on my tie, because i didn't know if i'll be going up on stage until the very last minute. when they announced the third place, and said my name. i thought i was dreaming. i felt like a little kid going up to shake the aapm president's hand.i was too nervous to look into the crowd. i was probably slouching too. i have bad posture. the rest of the award cereony i was texting M and my friends. most of them are in different parts of the world, but i'm glad to have them close by with the internet and my iphone.

after the ceremony i took pictures with my professor and B, and we all left for our own events. i wanted to get dinner asap and just relax and decompress with T and a movie. i finished watching fast and furious 4. then feeling like i wanted more i went on amazon prime and spedrun lolita, in secret, martha mary may marlene because i was on a movie addiction. all of these movies were gratuitous. they add no value to my life, and i'm not sure if i enjoyed spending them that way, but it brought me entertainment at the time. and it served its purpose to help me destress.

i then watched a few youtube videos by bibile project on what it means to love God with

- ["all your heart"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS4iM6KpPYo): "lev" in hebrew: not just organ but the center of a person's being
- ["all your soul"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_igCcWAMAM): "nephesh" in hebrew: does not mean an immortal essence but refers to a living, breathing, physical being
- ["all your strength"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aaVy1AmFX4): "mode" : "very" or "much" use every opportunity and capacity to honor him
