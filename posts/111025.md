stared out of the window in a waymo just appreciating how unique the SF buildings are. taking deep breaths. i felt like i was on a race track the past few weeks, and now i get to take a pit stop. went to japantown to get udon because i craved it. then walked around filmore st, saw some cute kittens for adoption, then got matcha at peets coffee and the plan was to get some work done, but the wifi was bad. so we took the bus home, a decision forced by W. the rest of the evening was filled up with packing my leftover stuff from our apartment. i got a cheap luggage from amazon just for this. and i found it was still not enough space to bring everything back. i have a surprising amount of stuff. stuff that i don't really need. dinner was j food again, because i can't get enough of it.
