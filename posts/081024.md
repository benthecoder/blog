> Because of the routines we follow, we often forget that life is an ongoing adventure...and the sooner we realize that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art: to bring all our energies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to notice and admit when what we expected to happen did not happen. We need to remember that we are created creative and can invent new scenarios as frequently as they are needed.

migraine was back in the morning and i couldn't do anything at all in the morning besides cook lunch. acetaminophen kicked in 3 hours after i took it at 11am and i could finally function for most of today. pretty cool that i got to meet alumnis from cohort 11. when i graduate, i'll be meeting future students too. and i'll be saying the same things and giving them advice.
