Some [reading rules](https://ryanholiday.net/these-38-reading-rules-changed-my-life) by Ryan Holiday that I like.

- Err on the side of age. Classics are classics for a reason.
- Bring a pen with you too. Reading is better if you’re taking notes
- Beat them up. Books are not precious things.
- The whole point of reading is to really understand something. If all you’re after is the ‘gist,’ skip books and stick with blog posts.
- Don’t just read books, re-read books. There’s a great line the Stoics loved—that we never step in the same river twice. The books don’t change, but you do.
- Embrace serendipity. So many of my favorite books are just random things I grabbed at bookstores
- “If we encounter a man of rare intellect, we should ask him what books he reads.”
- "Don’t be satisfied just getting the ‘gist’ of things," is what Marcus Aurelius learned from his philosophy teacher Rusticus.
- When intelligent people read, they ask themselves a simple question: What do I plan to do with this information?
- Look for wisdom, not facts. We’re not reading to just find random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? We’re reading to accumulate a mass of true wisdom—that you can turn to and apply in your actual life.
