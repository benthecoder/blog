another day spent debugging and fixing UI issues. i probably learn the most when debugging a system than when implementing a new feature in the app. debugging forces you deeper into the architecture, into the choices and decisions already baked into the product. you're forced to ask deeper questions, put on a different hat and see things from the perspective of a reviewer rather than a builder.
