[Minn Kim](https://twitter.com/minney_cat), early-stage, community-builder, O1 Visa advocate for immigrants @ [Plymouth](https://www.plymouthstreet.com/#about) [talks](https://youtu.be/-auYFuWxjgY?si=0EZTFYAvSAHwIzD-&t=1394) about what makes a good community.

1. shared purpose: individuals have mutual influence on each other
2. shared identity: a badge you can wear to convey you are a part of this group
3. ritual: what is the repeated/regular expected custom that you have?

The combination of those three things is what makes good communities stand the test of time.
