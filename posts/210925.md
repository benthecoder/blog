this was the day i used up all of my claude credits and got to -4.43 in my billing. i have been relying on claude code like it's my life source, and appended ultrathink on every query and spawned subagents. and looking back, it was mostly damaging my productivity and required me to clean up everything later. it was a bad habit i picked up from hackathons, and one that im starting to slowly unlearn at this job.
