started playing assasins creed the rebel collection on my sister's switch. i bought this game ages ago but didn't get into playin git. went to do a facial at herbaline. it is always more painful that what i remember. i really like how it starts with a salt bath for your feet, and ends with the fishes that chew on your dead skin. the massages are also incredible.
