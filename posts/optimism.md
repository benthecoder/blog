Dr. Ana talks about healthy optimism and how to cultivate it in her latest [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynjOQgll5PE).

Optimism can be [learned](https://www.verywellmind.com/learned-optimism-4174101), it involves developing the ability to view the world from a positive point of view. It is contrasted with [learned helplessness](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-learned-helplessness-2795326).

### 3 components of optimism

1. Permanence: is this bad thing forever?
   - pessimist: this will never end
   - optimist: this is temporary, it will pass
2. Pervasiveness: is this problem global?
   - pessimist: this is the worst, my life is over
   - optimist: not everything is bad, finds silver lining
3. Personalization: is this problem personal?
   - pessimist: it's all me, I'll never be good enough
   - optimist: this isn't my fault, I can't control everything

### Why optimism is good

There are many [benefits](https://positivepsychology.com/learned-optimism/#research) to optimism.

- lower heart problems
- live longer
- more motivated and successful
- more effective at decision making
- higher rates of well being and lower rates of depression

The opposite of optimism is depression, the cognitive triad of depression is negative thoughts about **yourself**, **other people**, and the **future**.

Depression causes pessimistic thinking, and you feel like this is just how the world is. You feel like you can't change anything, and you're stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. This is depression talking, it's not reality.
