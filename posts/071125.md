finally went to ut health to see a doctor since i left SF. i was supposed to go to PT a lot sooner but did not have the ability to book it due to insurance/availability.

ut health is a clean and modern building. i went to the top floor to get checked in, then went a floor below to see the sports medicine doctor. he was one of the best doctors i've met. he was attentive, curious, and asked good questions. he was also guiding a new resident so he explained everything very clearly as he was doing the checks, which was good for me to hear his thought process out loud.

after the checkup i went to pho thaison to get pho. i asked for the combo and wanted a smaller size, but they only had one size. the bowl was huge, but i somehow managed to finish it. it was mostly soup, i guess—just a visual play.

went to medici roasting to get some work done. ordered matcha. wifi was not working so i was on my data the entire time.

walked around ut austin and took some photos before i went home on a waymo.
