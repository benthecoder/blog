had to join a sales call discussing the plan. i zoned out really quickly. although they did talk about a few things that was good to learn and think about.

also broke the production deploy because a month or so ago i was using claude code to learn django migrations, and i had prod creds, and i did a migrate command directly on prod. which is embarrassing. i have learned to never commit that egregious sin again.
