a few advice on interpersonal relationships by [Ava](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-have-healthier-relationships)

- platonic love is as important as romantic love
  - a lot of people are too obsessed with their partners and not obsessed enough with their friends
  - In _Hard to Love_ Briallen Hopper writes that she experiences herself as someone formed and sustained by others' love and patience, and the kindness of strangers. there is no self-made man
- don't force relationship into a shape, ask for what you want.
  - advocate for your needs, be upfront about what you're looking for
  - there's no "convincing" people: love should be freely given and never coerced
  - In _Phaedrus_ Plato: eros, if channeled correctly, can turn from an obsessive preoccupation to an ability to appreciate the beauty in someone and see that beauty in other parts of the world
  - In _Waiting for God_ [Simone Weil](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/842432-we-want-to-get-behind-the-beauty-but-it-is): much the problems humanity experiences are caused by a desire to "eat beauty instead of seeing it" <mark>Can you see beauty without wanting to consume it?</mark>
- nothing fills the void inside you
  - "The realest thing in the world is the void, is emptiness, is transience. Love only makes sense in the context of impending oblivion."
  - don't get into friendships / romantic relationships to fill the void, believing they'll fix everything
  - French analyst Jacques Lacan: "Desire has indestructible permanence. Desire is inextinguishable"
- self-differentiate
  - In _A Passionate Marriage_ David Schnarch, it's defined as <mark>the ability to "maintain who you are while youâ€™re _close_ to the people important to you"</mark>
  - for with insecure attachment: they long for emotional fusion or avoidance to defend against engulfment.
  - <mark>"if you're sufficiently differentiated, you don't need to fuse to feel safe, and you don't need to hide to maintain your own individuality"</mark>
  - you succeed in a relationship by giving, but you have to know how to give without hurting yourself.
  - a test: "can you maintain boundaries when you're around people you love? Do you behave in a way you feel happy with, or do you betray yourself?
- do not try to change people
  - don't hope for people to change to keep the fantasy of a happy future alive
  - people change only when they're ready, not because we hope they will
- say the thing
  - you can't fake it or pretend it, it'll show through and all it does is stop you from connecting to someone in a real way
  - consistently saying what you want to say is a strength not a vulnerability
  - be self-aware enough to disclose the ugly things about yourself (charismatic people often weaponize their vulnerability)
