i landed and entered the airport, and felt at home. even though it wasn't home. it felt familiar. maybe i i just felt excited to see her in person.

i took the bus, the one on google maps was cancelled and i had to figure out another # to take. a worker at the stop helped me communicate since the drivers only speak hokkien. the ride was an hour. i napped.

once i got off the stop, i first noticed how loud the streets are in taiwan. the motorcycles are the culprit. SF is so quiet. i walk in the streets in the morning and sometimes it's dead silent.

i reached my hotel and i always have a sense of nervousness when i have to speak chinese. i'm worried i'll get thrown a word i don't understand. but i stay confident. that's the key.

i got a gift pack from T. there were flowers and cards. i've never received flowers before in my life. i felt blessed. i don't deserve her.

the fist thing i did after was get food from 7 eleven, which was right beside the hotel. i got mushroom porridge, and a bunch of throat medication. i had to get better or this trip is ruined. i tried everything.

the room was nice. i like the japanese style. the heated toilet seat is great.
