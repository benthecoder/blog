we started the day with a visit to dallas theological seminary. dad wanted to visit, he said it’s a popular seminary school.

we browsed through the bookstore. i would’ve expected more c.s. lewis books here. i only found two. after that, we went back to deep ellum. i wanted to try hawkers asian street food. i had high expectations coming in. it started strong. the roti was great, crispy, and the fried shrimp coconut was delicious.

but what came after was a disaster. my sister’s laksa had no taste, and the noodles were overcooked and mushy. my char kuey teow had hard noodles and did not taste anything like it at all. i was so disappointed. i learned not to order anything called malaysian food outside of new york and sf. seattle and texas have let me down.

after that, we went to 2nd street. i found an excursionist flex green jacket from peter millar. the retail price was \$895, which is insane, and it was listed for \$100. maybe it was anchor effect, but the design and quality were good, so i copped it.

then we went into deep vellum bookstore & publishing co. and ended up just sitting there, planning the rest of the night.

we had dinner early, at 6 pm, at terry black’s. i got one beef rib, half a pound of sliced brisket, a quarter pound of pork ribs, a quarter pound of turkey, and some sides. we took the beef rib to go. it was too much even for four people.

we stopped by whole foods, then headed to hillsboro and stayed at a la quinta inn for the night.
