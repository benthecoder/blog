Things to [remind ourselves](https://changelog.com/posts/things-we-always-remind-ourselves-while-coding) while coding.

I should have this printed out and put on my wall.

### On health & wellness

- Exercise
- Take a break (7x)
- Don’t burn out
- Make sure to eat
- Your body position

### Pep talk & self-encouragement

- I can do this
- It’s ok to fail
- You can do it
- You’ll figure it out
- The solution is probably simple
- Everyone has the same struggles
- There’s got to be a way to do this
- I’m not stupid—this just takes time
- There IS a solution, just have to find it
- Writing failing code is not a personality trait
- It’s going to be difficult before it gets easier

### Following best practices

- Keep it simple (8x)
- Verify, don’t trust
- Don’t DRY too soon
- Add sensible comments
- Good commit messages
- Simple is better than smart
- Don’t forget to do that side refactor

### Focus

- Not to drift off
- Don’t surf the web
- One thing at a time
- Read docs properly
- What am I working on?
- Read the documentation
- Read (and reread) the error message
- Finish committing before pushing (seriously)
- You don’t have time to try that new thing out
- (distracted) What was I supposed to be doing?
- Don’t spend an hour on tiny things that don’t matter

### Slowing down vs going faster

- Slow down
- Ship sooner
- Optimize it later
- It’s good enough
- Stop overthinking it
- Don’t over-optimize
- Don’t over-engineer
- Slow down and think
- Just get something working
- Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good
- There’s no single perfect solution, there are always drawbacks
- Better to get something out than sitting analyzing the problem
