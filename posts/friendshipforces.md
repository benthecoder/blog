> “People are at their most generous, their funniest, and their most fascinating when talking with and about their friends.”

"[The friendship files](https://archive.is/CgTjh)" is a series of interviews done by Julie Beck.

From 100 conversations with people talking about friendships, she believes that the [six forces](https://archive.is/7nO7d) that help form friendships and maintain them through the years are: accumulation, attention, intention, ritual, imagination, and grace.

1. Accumulation
   - time spent together is the most obvious force: it takes [40-60 hours](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518761225) within the first 6 weeks to turn acquaintance into casual friend, and 80-100 hours to become more than that
   - “Being around someone 24 hours a day, you tell them everything, ... You don’t do [that] when you are home.”
2. Attention
   - there are more opportunities than you think to make friends
   - “You have to look for friendship in places you would never expect it.
   - pay attention, notice when you click with someone, be open to chance encounters, step out of your habits and into the moments
3. Intention
   - you need action, when opportunity arises, have the courage, vulnerability, and willingness to let things be awkward.
   - friendship takes energy and thought; they take work. showing up for your friends take effort, but it should be joy.
4. Ritual
   - have something baked into your schedule so all you have to do is show up
   - book clubs, monthly hikes, dinner parties, group chats than run all day, etc.
5. Imagination
   - society places friendship on the sideline, it's playing supporting roles to work, family, and romance; design your life so friendship plays the role you want
   - ex: buying a house together, going therapy together, raising their children together, friends are people who choose to love each other radically every day.
6. Grace
   - the previous forces are ideas, they're impossible to fully live up to. life gets in the way
   - friendship is flexible, it can bend to fit the shape of our lives.
   - it doesn't always have to be about presence, it can be love that can weather absence
   - the concept of grace: a gift so profound that it can never be earned or deserved
     - offer forgiveness to each other when we fall short
     - create a space for connection, and reconnections, that feel nothing short of miraculous.
