> “Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.” – Luke 10:41-42 (NIV)

the advml exam was at 2 pm, so i still had time to study in the morning. the actual exam was not bad, it was mostly writing and explaining. out of the 10 proofs i tried my best to memorize by heart, only one of it came out. it was a pleasant experience, much better than the first exam i had with C. i left 40 minutes early and went to gym to do preacher curls. i got home, drank my protein shake, and started working on the distributed cheatsheet, and spent the entire night dumping 7 lecture slides worth of information onto one page while talking to T. it's silly that i'm writing notes on a piece of paper, yet i already feel nostalgic knowing i won't be a student soon and i won't have to do something like this anymore. i'm becoming older. i have to start dream bigger. coming to sf was never about my education, it was about taking the biggests risks with the best shot i've got.
