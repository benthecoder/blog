today all four of us, from the "mafia" team presented badgermole ai for CARD 2025. we took waymo to present on the main campus. this is my 3rd time being there. i was thinking how nice it would be to study on campus, instead of entering a brick building that feels like attending a mini conference that lasts for a year.

we started preparing what to say, who should say what, and fixing our demo app 15 minutes before our designated time. i was responsible for the tech stack. i was repeating the words i made up on the spot in my head, making sure i don't embarass myself.

we were the only vibe coded presentation, amongst other proper research work like predicting deafness in mice. after that we looked around at the posters. we stood at one of our classmates' poster. they used OpenCV YOLO to turn charts into data for emissions.

we took a lyft home soon after so wei can get food. the conversation revolved around politics. i napped in the car.
