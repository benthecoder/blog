Grant Sanderson, aka [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), a mathematician and programmer who makes beautiful animated math videos, talks about what "Follow Your Dreams" misses, and some advice in his [commencement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3I3kAg2J7w) at Harvey Mudd.

- focus on adding value
  - "Success hinges on how effectively you're able to add value to others."
- <mark>action precedes motivation</mark>
  - engage in activities and just do things even if you don't feel motivated initially. motivation follows action.
- adapt and be flexible
  - "Treat passion not as a destination, but as a fuel, following not dreams, but opportunities."
  - be prepared to change directions based on new opportunities
- seize current opportunities
  - "Ask yourself <mark>what's possible now that wasn't possible ten years ago</mark>, and which might get harder ten years from now."
  - identify and act on emerging opportunities that are less crowded
- influence and encourage others
  - "Never underestimate just how much influence you can have on others, especially the ones who are younger than you are."
  - recognize the impact you can have on others, small acts of encouragement can significantly shape their paths (see [Pygmalion effect](/posts/pygmalion))
- think beyond yourself
  - pursue passions that extends beyond self-interest and focus on how they can benefit others. this makes for more meaningful success
