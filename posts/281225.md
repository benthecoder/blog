we went to first baptist church dallas. it was the largest church i've ever been to in my life. we arrived late, and the first thing we experienced was a grand worship with a choir and an orchestra. it's what i imagine heaven to feel and sound like.

after church, we visited thanksgiving square and saw the chapel inside. the spiral design was beautiful. we had lunch at the Exchange food hall, then went to Otto's hotel for matcha.

after that we went to the big eye ball, and right across the street was the Joule hotel, which houses the taschen library.  i love taschen books. if i could, i'd own the nasa archives, the hiroshige and hokusai collections, monet, their industrial design book, and the world's most beautiful libraries by listri, and many more that i have yet to discover.

next was  the dallas museum of art. they have a nice collection. although i was in a wheelchair controlled by my sister, so not a lot of autonomy to explore. i felt a lot of eyes on me, they must be wondering why i was in a wheelchair for someone my age.

before dinner, we drove to east dallas to check out a vintage store. i found two great books: bertrand russell's a history of western philosophy and a 60s new yorker collection. then we went to deep ellum and browsed through thrifted threads and poet's books, which was a nice spot. i spotted a nice lamp at the bookstore.

dinner was at the rosewood mansion on turtle creek. this was my first time fine dining like this. we ordered bread, steak tartare, caesar salad, hamachi crudo, lobster lumpia, truffle gnudi, market fish, rack of lamb, king salmon, sweet potato, broccolini, and a glass of malbec for dad.

the whole meal, i couldn't stop googling ingredients on my phone. how are truffles collected? what is filipino asín tibuók salt? what makes parmigiano-reggiano expensive? what are the health benefits of shiso? what is gribiche? what exactly is gnudi? every dish had something i'd never heard of before, and i wanted to understand what i was eating.

the bill came to $550. honestly, the service wasn't great, which was disappointing given the price. but what mattered was i wanted my parents to experience it. 

at night i watched terminator 2: judgement day, which objectively is the best terminator movie.
