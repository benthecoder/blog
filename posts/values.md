![The Hunters in the Snow, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 1565](/images/huntersnow.jpg)

in [29 Thoughts for 29 Years](https://www.whitenoise.email/p/29-thoughts-29-years), Tom White grapples with the big questions, contemplating his life and his values, his [telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos).

asking the questions:

- Who am I?
- Why am I?
- What are my guiding principles?
- What are the guiding principles of the people with whom I interact on a regular basis?
- What would I sacrifice my life for?
- What would the people I am closest with sacrifice their life for?
- What is the most important thing for them?
- How about for me?
- Are my answers to the above questions honest or mere bullshit—dishonest balm to sooth my soul?

According to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt’s, maturity is the ability to pin down and articulate your values.

> To be mature you have to realize what you value most.
>
> It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity. **They seem never to have paused to consider what has value for them. They spend great effort and sometimes make great sacrifices for values that, fundamentally, meet no real needs of their own**. Perhaps they have imbibed the values of their particular profession or job, of their community or their neighbors, of their parents or family.
>
> Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one’s own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for.

We are only faintly aware of the habits of thoughts and behaviours that shape the course of our lives.

_The highlighted ones are my favorites._

- Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue.

Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer. ―Rainer Maria Rilke
