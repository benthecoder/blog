we presented llm controlled 3d characters app in front of class. it wasn't our best work, but i'm glad it is done. the other classmates presented their own apps. there was a recipe app, a podcast generator app, a mock interview app, an app to read your T&Cs, etc.

last ethics class of the semester. admittedly i barely paid attention in this class. but one thing i found interesting is the allowed use of AI in the assignments and final project, as well as stating the usage of AI, including the prompts and output. this was my first ever class where i had to explicitly mention how i utilized AI, and i think that will be how education evolves, with AI, and not against it.
