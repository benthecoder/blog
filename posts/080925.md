apparently people on linkedin have been putting vibe code cleaner in their headline. it is because of people like me who rely on claude code too much. i want speed and i want quality, but you often have to get one or the other. went through major cleanup of duplicated/messy code generated by claude code. i need to do better on this. rely on cc less and start using my skills so far. but doing so i have been learning a lot from the code review comments. so maybe this is a lesson i have to learn.
