![JJC x100s accessories](/images/050126-x100s.jpg)

first standup of 2026. time to get back to work. i had anxiety coming back to this day, all the pressure of work came flooding back in, i try to maintain my core value and mission of what work im doing here and the impact it has. 

finally got my new camera battery charger and lens hood, on amazon they're labelled as JJC Lens Hood for Fujifilm Fuji and USB Dual Battery Charger for Fujifilm NP-95 FinePix. i like the idea of upgrading accessories for a third-hand fujifilm camera, the art of maintenance.

i couldn't stop working till late night, parents had to literally feed me food. im so glued to my computer
this has to change in 2026. also spent hours trying to decide a date to move to miami and sent my lease notice to the apartment of my intent to move.
