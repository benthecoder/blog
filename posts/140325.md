we went to campus to setup at 4pm, and unpacked the $150 worth of decorations for our hackathon. decorations are hard, i spent an hour assembling this red dragon, and some more finding the right letters to spell Chinatown Hacks. things are coming together. before finishing the decor we had to rush home in a lyft for W's workshop. after dinner we ended up staying up till 2am working on the slides and prize planning. we planned to meet at 5:30 am. i slept at 2am.
