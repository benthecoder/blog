I flew from Iowa to San Jose today.

With time on my hands, and the state of flow that being on a plane induces, I finally got around to my queue on [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) and read a couple of interesting articles which I'm going to list here.

There are a lot of great ideas here, especially the ones under life and career. It made me reflect on the path I'm on in life right now, and on choosing the right path to take next.
