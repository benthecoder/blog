> I need images ... I need representation which deals in means other than reality. We have to use reality but get out of it. That’s what I try to do all the time.

got my QLLY 16 inch ikea legs to place my books. the hope is it will get me to read more. or at least it can be a nice decor in my room. a few books on the table now are claude monet: the truth of nature, a book of days by patti smith, a book on cats,, made in taiwan: recipes and stories from the island nation, a photography guide book by national geographic, encyclopedia of an ordinary life, the complete works by montaigne, the unquiet mind, the conquest of happiness, and a few others.

having books around me is always comforting. art and images as well. i need color and information around me. at all times. i'm terrified of not knowing enough. without knowing more, how can i grow? i must keep learning, at all times.
