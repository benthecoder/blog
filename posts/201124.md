what i felt last night was mostly gone. woke up a different person.

it rained the whole day today. spent the whole day mostly in meetings. i can always learn something new in these meetings. there's always a new pytorch function, a new medical concept, an problem with the data, or lack thereof, that is unique to radiation oncology. went a bit into what mixed precision training is, found out about `torch.apm`.

i've never felt work being fun. this is a first. even though research is like the wild west, and i'm a complete stranger to this field, but there's a certain allure to finding new papers to read, extracting their insights and takeaways, and then figuring out how to apply it to my own problem. the hardest part right now is defining the problem itself. i know that there are capable LLMs now, and we have multimodal data, but how can we utilize that, and for what? can pretraining be done?

so interesting to see T and family together through a screen. it felt like a dream. glad that she got my gift. grateful for my family for helping me.

spent the night being anxious about the test, reading through slides and generating questions with claude till 1am.
