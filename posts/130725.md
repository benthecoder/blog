D treated a big group of church members to lunch at floating sushi boat. i sat down with the members, talking about my job hunt, about T, about my future, and about future plans and where their dream travel locations are. the food was good. i discovered a new found love for tempura. i wasn't big on fried food because of GERD, but i absolutely devoured it. that combined with tentsuyu is amazing. which i learned is a combo of dashi + soy sauce, mirin and some sugar.

bought KPH30i with Yaxi ear pads. i want headphones so bad. i have to stop wearing airpods so much and stuffing my ear. there has to be consequences to that.
