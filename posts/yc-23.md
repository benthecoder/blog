Found a [thread](https://twitter.com/jacobrintamaki/status/1670249966806376449?s=20) of memorable moments from the [2023 Y Combinator summer conference](https://www.ycombinator.com/events/summerconf2023) which I did not get accepted into.

- “Go to therapy” - it seems expensive, but not getting it is more expensive
- “If you’re in a job where you’re not learning or earning a lot leave it. (Best places to do both are startups with PMF)”
- “Founders shouldn’t put yourself in an HR box. Don’t be a “junior python backend developer” be a Swiss Army knife.”

- "Ship a lot" - speed gives you more rep for learning
- absurdly focus on creating value for users

- “find a good cofounder, good things sometimes take time to grow, and if I was in school I would grow as many relationships as possible”

- Be careful about who funds your research if you want to turn it into a startup
- Beware science fair startups (cool demo but doesn’t really work)
- User interface + building a web server is underrated for ML businesses

Ehko Dealer

- People love helping students (say you’re a student)
- Lots of YC value is group partners that can pattern match problems
- Big tech jobs can be useful to 1) learn how well-oiled machine works + 2) Connections
- Asking a successful or failed founder in a given area: “what would you do if you had to start another startup in this area?”
