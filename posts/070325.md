> "A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is. It has nothing to do with the fact that other people want what they want." – Oscar Wilde

distributed exam is over. this semester is finally over. went to I's house for a mini party. played raunchy card games and hide-and-seek boomerang. i drank wine. saved some white lilies to bring back home.

T got her offer for UW. i'm so proud of her. i started to imagine a future where she's in seattle, and i'll fly over to see her and she'll sometimes fly in too during her breaks. eventually she graduates and i get a comfortable job, and we start to build a life together. i start to dream. it's nice to be able to dream. how else do i look forward to the future?
