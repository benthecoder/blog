Matt Rickard shares his [reflection](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming) on 10,000 hours of programming

I'm noting down a couple ones that I would like to remember.

On finding answers

> - Browsing the source is almost always faster than finding an answer on StackOverflow
> - In many cases, what you're working on doesn't have an answer on the internet. That usually means the problem is hard or important, or both.

On code

> - Simple is hard.
> - Delete as much code as you can.
> - If it looks ugly, it is most likely a terrible mistake
> - Name variables correctly
> - It should probably be refactored if you have to write a comment that isn't a docstring. Every new line of comments increases this probability. (For a more nuanced take, the [Linux Kernel Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#commenting))

On knowing how it works

> - Know the internals of the most used ones like git and bash
> - If you don't understand how your program runs in production, you don't understand the program itself

On productivity

> - There's no correlation between being a 10x programmer and a 10x employee (**maybe a negative one**).
> - Some programmers are 10x more efficient than others. I know because I've been both a 10x programmer and a -1x programmer.
