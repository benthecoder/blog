- Woke up at 11 and no one was in hotel room and I was filled with fear
- Felt the intense urge to go running and exercise more to increase my appetite levels, and also to increase energy levels and strength for life in SF
- I’ve been having poor appetite the past few weeks and it cannot go on like this in SF, I have 3 weeks left
- Never seen the brand Moncler before they have a cool logo. How do these brands start and how do they get famous
- Instead of looking how people dress I should focus on old people and babies, they help me see life differently
- Didn’t get to visit any museums but at least I get to visit a taiwan museum gift shop at the airport
- SANYU paintings are crayon-like
- National Palace Museum “Up the River during Qingming”
- I’m surprisingly awake with 3 hours of sleep
- Fall asleep, Leila Milke is good
- Can’t fall asleep on the plane, I keep playing back memories in my head, also dreaming new ones at the same time
- don't look back in anger
- Probably my first time not reading in a plane
- Going back malaysia airport has to be in my top 10 most unpleasant events because its associated with not being able to stay in the US
- Is it racist to prefer your own race?
- feels like I was stuck in a long dream and now I woke up
- BACK TO REALITY
