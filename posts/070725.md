> If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things – praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts – not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (any microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.

i wanted to renew my cali license. i took bart all the way to DMV daly city, and walked to the dmv. and along the way took some photos with my sony. studied for OE on the train. got there, and realized that my appointment was for august. i got back in line, and used the "get in line" feature. and proceeded to make my job talk slide in excalidraw. after 2 hours of waiting, and going up to a counter, i was told i needed my EAD card which i already got, but did not bring with me. one upside is i got to focus on making the excalidraw presentation with no distractions whatsover under my hotspot and in a crammed seating area. and that if i'm relocationg to austin, there would be no need to renew my licesnse. so i head home with no losses.
