Read this great [lecture](https://gist.github.com/gtallen1187/27a585fcf36d6e657db2#file-scar_tissue-md): "Scar Tissues Make Relationships Wear Out", by a CS Stanford professor [John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/).

A few takeaways:

- there isn't a single spectacular thing that wrecks a relationship, it's the accumulation of little things that builds up: **scar tissue**
- if you want relationships to last, keep the scar from building up through **communication** and **compromise**
- be willing to listen to understand the other person's view
- if there's an issue, resolve it where there is zero lingering animosity
- Some people are too nice, and that wrecks relationships because they're willing to give in, avoid arguments, and not compromise, which is a bad idea.
- "Ask yourself, "Are you really, completely, 100% over this? You're giving in? No animosity? You're not secretly hoping that maybe they'll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?"
- The flipside is bad too, if you're outarguing the person, you're nuking the relationship
