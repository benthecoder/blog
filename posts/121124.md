> Perhaps it never did snow that August in Vermont; perhaps there never were flurries in the night wind, and maybe no one else felt the ground hardening and summer already dead even as we pretended to bask in it, but that was how it felt to me, and it might as well have snowed, could have snowed, did snow.

forgot to normalize before doing regularized ridge regression. mistakes like this i will remember for a while. making mistakes is better than getting everything right in this sense.

costco run with family. 5 dollar roast chicken is so value.

walked around with W for his bday. bought a spathiphyllum plant for the house from ikea.

dinner at chef hungs, salty fried pork chop is good. i realize i still don't participate in conversations. i just nod and listen. i'm always staring into the distance. i wonder where my mind goes. i can't remember.

hung all the art i have in my room. stuck all the post cards i have. it feels cozier. for some reason i only feel home is more like home once my family came to visit. i never bothered to put up my art and my table was becoming a mess, now it feels cozy. and it will be empty again in 8 months.
