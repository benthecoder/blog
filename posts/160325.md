we left at 9 am to pick up pastries from yummy bakery. we got there and prepped the pastries on the table. then i waited for my friends to show up. i checked them in and they started mentoring the students. after bringing the prizes down, unboxing the 12 headsets and 72 cars, i went on a cybertruck ride with B and W. it's such a huge car, driving it and parking it every day must be a pain. after coming back, i spent the entire time working on the judging sheet, and making sure things were ready for judging.

i went on another cybertruck ride with chinatown mafia, with J driving. everything after submission deadline was chaos, i briefed the judges about the sheet, and the demo began at around 4 pm. the first team took 10 minutes, and we had to be more strict. all 13 teams took 2 hours to present, we ended the last presentation at 6:28 pm. which left the judges about 15 minutes. then we had to rush through our speech and present the prizes before our school started to kick us out. we finally left the building around 7:30 pm after cleaning up everything.

yakiniku for kbbq, started at 8:50 pm, beer and soju, the premium set, ate till 11, they went to get boba after. got home at 12 am, took an hour to wind down. slept at 1 something. i have an exciting week ahead.
