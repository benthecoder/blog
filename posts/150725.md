had a dry run of my presentation for AAPM. went into one of the UCSF offices, they always look so sad inside. went into one of their libraries to present. i did not realize there would be almost 25 people in the room. after my presentation they talked of doing clinical matching, since they couldn't see the true value of my research.

i walked to japantown to visit my favorite bookstore, the forest books. i was on the hunt for cs lewis books. i eventually bought his book "christian reflections". while paying for it, i sawÂ a collection of 17 Floating World art books printed in Japan. i spoke to the cashier and an old lady about those books, they said a few thousand and the owner would be happy to sell it to me. i wanted them. but with the move, it would be tough. i want a home full of books and arts that i can enjoy. and hopefully in it, with the people i love close to me.
