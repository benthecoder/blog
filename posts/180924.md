today will go down in history as one of the best moments of my life. everything worked out in the end like it was scripted in a movie

lunch in richmond in green island

book hunting in green apple

grocery shopping at New Lien Hing Supermarket

got the news on the bus, internally screaming, felt like a dream

soy milk at trader joes

ping pong at transamerica redwoods park

haidilao in fremont, the same place i was 2 years ago

glad to see old friends, and new friends meeting old friends

more moments like this to come
