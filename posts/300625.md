i started to run multiple experiments again, and was given 4 days to complete them all. i also started to write the git commits for OE for my coding test. this was possibly the most important commit and PR comment of my life. i kept checking it over and over again, making sure i didn't make any after submitting it, i spent the rest of day just running experiments.

a few kitchen wishlist that i found

- bain marie
- chef press
- kama asa cutting board
