> Dr. Kelson: Spike, momento mori, what did it mean?  
> Spike: Remember we must die.  
> Dr. Kelson: And it's true. There are many kinds of death. Some are better than others. The best are peaceful where we leave each other in love. You love your mother?  
> Spike: I love her.  
> Dr. Kelson: And Isla you love Spike?  
> Isla: So much.  
> Dr. Kelson: Memento amorous. Remember you must love.

i went to tour an apartment with wei. it's in South Van Ness, and it's a new apartment, and he's the first to tour it and live in it. after his tour we went to watch 28 years later at AMC kabuki. the seats here are not as nice as the ones in ames. they don't even recline. i always thought every AMC in the entire US had reclining seats.

realize i don't look in depth enough into each configurations. and i ran everything with the purpose of completing it. i need to give more thought into my choices in my work, or it will come back biting me in the end. i can't sacrifice quality for speed.
