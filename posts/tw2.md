- feeling both nervous and excited
- First time being in a church that was a mall
- Taiwanese people are all very friendly and welcoming
- Their choir was heavenly
- Lots of standing at this church, maybe twice or three times more
- Taiwanese people and chinese Malaysians have lots in common, similar history roots
- Faith can change people in unexpected ways, and testimonies can really inspire others and rekindle existing faith. how much of my life can be a testimony, I remember Pastor T mentioning its hardships that make your life a testimony, but I feel like my life hasn’t been that hard after all
- Wish I could speak good enough chinese or have the courage to join in on the conversations instead of just smiling and nodding
- Had a slight desire for my parents to be more academic and intellectual, and would explain and teach me things, but also at the same time appreciate how I can be friends with my parents. Pros and cons
- Can’t understand how someone could beat their partner, was the person like this from the beginning or certain events turned them into someone so evil to physically hurt somebody they used to love (to the point of marriage)
- So much respect in bring up the kids on her own, especially one of them being special
- Treasure hill artist village is a nice place, the rain helped make it less scary when its darker and there’s not many people around
- taipei 101 mall is smaller and emptier than KLCC mall
- Never seen a KTV booth before
- I need to learn how to 烤肉 better
- Met German journalists here for computex
- The inside of their MRT look like a hospital
- It's cool to see a ME professor’s office of 30+ years
- Thanks T for bringing me around :\)
