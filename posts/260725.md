im back at the sf airport just in just short of 2 weeks.

backfilled my blog on my taiwan trip on the plane to DC. the plane ride is 5 and a half hours this time.

watched love hurts. it wasn't bad. i liked the fight scenes, but didn't

ride pickups for washington is much closer, but the roads don't make sense. it was chaotic, there were police cars and two big tour bus to pickup a band. i didn't get the chance to find out which band.

talked to uber driver, she mentioned houses in DC, 800 sq ft. for 2 bedrooms costs $4k

i stayed at Motto by Hilton. i rushed to SPIN. i walked there and took photos with my fujifilm. the color was pretty with the sunset.

i looked around the ping pong bar and found the table with some pros. i was so excited to play. i joined soon after and started just going crazy on the top spins. i was so alive. i was also sweating like crazy. i didn't even feel any pain in my leg anymore. it's also such a good way to make friends. i'm forever grateful for uncle V for teaching me ping pong back when i was 10.

went home with two washu students on the way back. picked up pho for dinner. worked on the slides till 1:30 am. felt anxious about my slides not being good enough.
