Some notes from [Nathan Lambert](https://www.natolambert.com/) on [job hunting](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/ai-phd-job-hunt) with a Ph.D. from Berkeley.

## Job Process Reflections

- **High yield**: Candidates from prestigious schools can experience high response rates to job applications, allowing more time for reflective interview preparation rather than application quantity.
- **Waiting game**: Rejections are usually received before acceptances, suggesting a pattern of companies responding faster to non-preferred candidates; it's common and provides an opportunity to network and hone interview skills.
- **Networking value**: The AI research community is small and offers the chance to meet high-quality contacts, adding long-term value beyond immediate job prospects.
- **Research scientist titles**: These carry prestige and can affect career paths significantly, with companies like OpenAI offering more neutral titles like "Member of Technical Staff" that can have varied recruitment pipelines.
- **Postdoc consideration**: A postdoc is suitable for some, opening doors especially in academia; however, for those with industrial aspirations, it's often better to proceed without unless a postdoc offers a uniquely supportive environment for growth.

## Interview Preparation

### By roles

- The **paper-writing** research scientist interviews: all about evaluating your vision, your place in the broader research community, and ability to work with the team.
- The **product-focused** research scientist interviews: mix between faculty search self-promotion and practical engineering questions, in reality they will do the same work as other engineers.
- The **machine learning engineer** interviews: pushed more on practical problems. More machine learning fundamentals interviews (things like logistic regression, probability fundamentals, vector calculus, and math puzzles).
- The **robotics engineer** interviews: fun systems questions. extremely specific to robotics, less time talking about ML or RL.

### Most common questions

- What do you want to work on when you show up? Who do you want to work with? If you had unlimited compute what would you work on?
- What was a past project you worked on? What was the impact? What did you learn?
- What styles of communication do you prefer? Do you work in teams? Do you value mentorship?

## Actionable Tips

- **Coding Practice**: Consistent coding practice, such as using LeetCode premium.
- **ML Background Interviews**: While tricky, preparing for "ML Background" interviews (math tricks and basic ML tradeoffs) through coursework study can be advantageous.
- **Job Talk Preparation**: Emphasize a strong narrative and vision in your job talk, focusing less on technical detail and more on **engaging storytelling**.
- **Research Agenda**: Clearly outlining a research agenda with timelines and goals can clarify your process and intentions for starting new projects.
- **Saying No**: Be willing to decline unreasonable demands from companies; most are flexible and aim for a positive candidate experience.
- **Interview Topics**: Inquire about interview preparation topics; recruiters might provide specific areas to focus on, such as programming concepts or problem-solving domains.
