went to the church to practice for sunday. feels good to play again. it's the oldest church i've played in. the tinted decorative window panes (i'm not sure what they are called) are beautiful. i could feel numbness going down my right leg on the pedal.

got an email from my professor yesterday that i should get the paper done today. i can feel a ticking time bomb in the back my mind. i needed to get out of the house. took the 45 min #5 bus, got motion sickness from trying to work.

went to la promenade cafe to meet A, got a medium matcha latte, 4.50 with an additional 75c for soy milk. this might be the best matcha i've had. took my experiments group project meeting till it closed at 6. went to anza branch library after to check it out. it's much smaller than i imagined.

grinded away for the research, trying my best to show for something that possibly does not make sense at all. what if the thing i'm â€ rying to prove isn't even true? what is the point of proving it? i was losing my sanity.

The two things that were drilled into my head

in the process, i had an idea to create beatiful LaTeX tables for research papers and for presentations. i'll have researchers dump results from their analysis, either .txt or .csv files (set length and size LIMIT), and CLAUDE generates the LaTeX code. make it with vercel. it should render the LaTeX code to copy, and also allow them to download image. i've been doing this at least 20 times today
