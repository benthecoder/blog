I was chatting with a friend and we talked about validating our startup idea with marketing and outreach before spending time building out the product.

I found this hackernews [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28263375) talking about the same topic.

I also recalled this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th8JoIan4dg) by YC, which talks about how to get ideas and evaluate whether they are worth pursuing.

### 4 most common mistakes

1. not solving a real problem: (SISP: solution in search of problem ex: AI is cool what can AI be applied to)
2. getting stuck on tarpit ideas: tarpit = set of ideas that have been around forever but have been stuck in tar and don't seem to get anywhere
   - what causes tarpit ideas? : widespread problem, seems easy to solve, structural reason why it hasn't been solved
3. not evaluating an idea
4. waiting for the perfect idea

### 10 key question for any idea

1. Do you have a founder/market fit?: pick a good idea for my team!
2. How big is the market?: ex: Coinbase
3. How accute is the problem? ex: Brex
4. Do you have competition?: Most good ideas have competition, but needs a new insight -> Yes I do
5. Do you want this?: Do you know personally who wants this? -> I know someone who wants this, but I am not sure if I want this.
6. Did this recently become possible or necessary? ex: Checkr
7. Are there good proxies for this business? proxies is a large company that does something similar, but not a direct competitor. Rappi example.
8. Is this an idea you'd want to work on for years?: boring idea is okay, and tend to be passionate over time.
9. Is this a scalable business? Software -> check, high skilled human labor.
10. Is this a good idea space? Do you expect is going to have a reasonable hit rate. ex: Fivetran

### 3 things that make ideas good

1. hard problem ex: Stripe (credit card processing and banks)
2. boring space ex: Gusto (payroll)
3. existing competitors ex: DropBox (19 other competitors which had bad UI, dropbox edge was integration with OS)

### 3 main ways to come up with ideas

- become an expert on something valuable
- work at a startup
- build things you find interesting

### 7 recipe to generate ideas

1. start with what your team is good at : automatic founder market fit (ex: Rezi)
2. start with a problem you've personally encountered (ex: Vetcove)
3. think of things you've personally wish existed (ex: DoorDash)
4. look at things that have changed recently (ex: Covid -> Gathertown)
5. Look for new variants of successful companies (ex: Nuvocargo)
6. talk to people and ask them what problems they have (pick fertile idea space and talk to people in that space ex: AtoB)
7. look for a big industry that seem broken (ripe for disruption)
8. find a cofounder with an idea
