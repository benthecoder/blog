I watched anniee's video on how to shut your mind up and one of the things she recommended was a [rainy day playlist](https://youtu.be/4D8CC6WFGMo?si=FW-b2EqCKqJAGQGC&t=1054) for the bad days and it inspired me to make a list of things I should reach for on days when things aren't the best, and I'm not feeling like myself and easily get stuck in negative loops.
