Some [advice](https://enlightenedcaveman.com/2006/06/25/advice_for_new_college_grads/) for new college grads by Chris from 2006.

It's advice that was written down 17 years ago, yet is still as, or more, important today.

- amount of happiness ∝ amount of frustration
  - frustration is all about unmet expectations, learn to set your expectation about life realistically.
  - when you find yourself dissatisfied, ask yourself what you expected, and **ask yourself why you expected what you did**.
- Good things in life take work
  - in careers (work extra hard in your 20s) and in relationship (like taking care of a plant)
  - don't expect getting to good life will be easy.
- Rethink what you **really** want
  - if you want to be rich, why? to not work again? that's boredom.
  - best reason to be rich is: to go from "have tos" -> "want tos"
  - ultimate goal: meaningful relationships
    - "the good life is a life inspired by love and guided by knowledge" - Bertrand Russell
- the world is vastly different today than when your parents started working
  - no more working for the same company for your entire career
  - be mindful of the opportunities for advancement
  - the objective of your first job is to get a better one as soon as you can.
- time is to be spent and invested wisely
  - the key to good life is <mark>balancing how much time you spend on the moment and on the future</mark>
  - spend 12 on the future and 4 on today (3:1 ratio)
    - future = your job, working out (health), reading (gaining knowledge for the future), artistic endeavors (emotional outlets are tied to mental health and sometimes your financial future)
    - in the moment is your release: party. have fun. socialize.
- focus on your people skills
  - social education is every bit as important as scholarly education
  - try to understand what motivates people and why; ask questions and learn to listen
  - be interested in people because you can learn something from anyone.
  - be mindful of how people perceive you; be aware of what's going on in the minds of other people
  - axiom: <mark> expect more from yourself and less from other people </mark>
- Money: Learn to say no to your desires
  - avoid debt as much as possible
  - maximize income and minimize expenses
  - your lifestyle should reflect your desires to have vast richest later;
- <mark>Love is wonderful, but also extremely dangerous</mark>
  - think about what you want out of love; discern about who you fall in love with
  - the feeling of love is largely outside of our control, but we are in control of whether we are in situations where love may emerge.
  - get to know people from a distance before you get intimate with them
