> There is something like a value structure inside of us—a web of thoughts, feelings, intuitions, goals, ethical principles, and so on—that we can tap into. It will rank order our options for us and tell us what matters, if we want. In moments of clarity, we can make contact with that value structure, and it will tell us, in no uncertain terms, that almost everything we do is irrelevant.

i volunteered again today. the second time felt more boring. it was not novel anymore, and not as romantic as the first time, the second time felt more rigid and structured, i already knew what to expect, i was bored from the tasks, and i wanted to get out as soon as i could.

there are many things like this in life, it feels exciting at first, i get a burst of dopamine, but soon i get bored of it, and i need new stimulation. from time to time, i should sit down and ask myself:

"What is the problem you should be working on now?"

and if this is the problem,

"What alternatives do I have?"
