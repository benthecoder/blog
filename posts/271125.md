i cooked two eggs for her with smoked salmon and she made me her signature banana cake with non dairy yoghurt and berries. we had breakfast.

then we did some more work and went to play ping pong. it was so cold. i didn't enjoy it, but i bore it to play with her, so she could have a good time.

tonight we made hotpot. i tried getting ingredients from 99 ranch, but two door dashers cancelled on me after picking up some ingredients. i got frustrated.

we still went through with it, but we just didn't have sesame paste. we tried getting creative, used sesame seeds and ground them with my blender, added sesame oil and soy sauce. it just wasn't the same. but we had the mushroom soup paste and sliced beef from weee to make up for it.

we had a movie night and watched about time. i love watching a movie in bed with a projector with her. it's one of the best feelings ever.
