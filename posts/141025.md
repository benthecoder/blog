felt anxious today when i got a message that i wasn't sure how to respond. so i ask for help on suggestions on how to respond. but my help is not responding me as well. which means i'm leaving that person on read. as each minute passes by, i overthink about whether that person is waiting for my response as well. so i'm stuck in between, i have all the context about the project, but not the authority nor skill to communicate effectively. me not replying says something about my character, and what i actually say also tells a lot about my character as well, so i'm paralyzed. i need to learn how to avoid this in the future.
