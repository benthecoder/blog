watching my colleagues present during prod review, i observed a few things that make them good presenters, they:

- show they are excited and proud about the thing more than anyone else
- are brief on the technical details
- present a scenario and gives you a problem
- jump right into a demo
- explain what problem it solves
  - presents clear metrics, instead of 10 hours, it's now 10 minutes
- talk about what can be better, and how it's going to be used today, how it will evolve

most people are so skillful at presenting that i can't help but admire them, and want to learn how to present like them as well.

after the presentations and news, i felt immensely grateful for being at this company. and i was filled with even more excitement and hope for the upcoming months, as i continue to work on interesting projects that have a huge impact on health in the US.
