evangelical chinese church in seattle, rainy morning, could barely stay awake for the sermon. the people here are on the younger side, common for a church near a university. we went back to the hotel soon after service ended and we had dried ramen. we went to the fireplace in the lobby and i kept falling asleep. went back to the room and did a financial literacy study interview for T and her classmate. we had k food for dinner, and we watched the chosen while eating.
