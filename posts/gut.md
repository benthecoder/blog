There are trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that lives in our bodies.

This is our gut microbiome, which performs various functions in our bodies.

What function does it have?

- They help with food digestion.
- They produce essential nutrients for our bodies.
- They play a role in regulating the immune system and protecting against harmful pathogens.

Gut health also affects your mental health, weight, blood sugar, and liver

Our diet pays a significant role in maintaining a healthy gut.

Prebiotic foods (whole grains, bananas, greens, onions, garlic, soybeans, and artichokes) act as food for healthy gut bacteria.

Dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is an excellent fuel for gut bacteria.

It promotes the production of short-chain fatty acids that nourish the gut barrier and reduce inflammation.

Low-fiber processed foods can [negatively impact our gut bacteria](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/01/low-fiber-diet-may-cause-irreversible-depletion-of-gut-bacteria.html).

These foods provide less fuel for the bacteria, leading to decreased diversity and hungry bacteria. Some bacteria may even start feeding on the mucus lining.

The basic idea is:

- Eat more: Probiotics, prebiotics, fiber, polyphenols and fermented foods
- Eat less: Artificial sweeteners, red meat, processed foods and alcohol.
