went to ctown to get my haircut with W. the lady remembers that i went to DC and moved to austin. we talked about AI again and how she's spooked that it knows things about her. i try to explain my work in mandarin, it's not easy. i told her the next time i'm back i want to perm my hair. i've always wanted to do it and maybe this is the time.
