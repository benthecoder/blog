we went to the alamo drafthouse to watch a movie. it was my first time going. when you enter, you see props and visuals from the shining. even the blood spilling onto the floor, effects done with lights. it was cool.

i was excited for this movie. i'd had a phase of binging aliens, and predator is a cool creature. they have an intense focus on just one goal, to become The Ultimate Predator and their technology is fascinating. predator badlands didn't disappoint. i munched on their burger and fries. no sauce, no cheese. it was dry and i knew it wasn't good for my health, but i ate it all anyway, and enjoyed the beautiful design of the world and characters. i was fully immersed.

after the movie we made cantonese steamed fish with ginger and shallots. it's such a simple yet perfect way to cook fish.

it was also the day the new laptop arrived. i started transferring the data from my old laptop into the new m4 air silver. i was happy for her to have it. i hope it makes her more productive and helps her become the great designer she can be.
