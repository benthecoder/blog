started onboarding with inklink. got my email and the day involved some whiteboarding and discussions. i still don't feel excited at all. deep down i know i don't fit in here.

walking with J i was almost convinced into 3500 dollar apartment. but after talking to A i realize it would've been a huge financial mistake.

went to jenn's place for CATAN with a few of their friends. i was so drained i fell asleep on their air mattress. i woke up with soreness in my neck and back.
