> The best moments in reading are when you come across something - a thought, a feeling, a way of looking at things - which you had thought special and particular to you. Now here it is, set down by someone else, a person you have never met, someone even who is long dead. And it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours.

found these two blogs for the job hunt:

- [(Quirky) Roadmap for New Grad Data Scientists](https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/newgrads/#tldr)
- [(Opinionated) Guide to ML Engineer Job Hunting](https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews/)

tons of good advice in here.

takeaway is: organize your thoughts, materials, and track on notion, and keep practicing, and have fun along the way

got hit with my medical bill from chinese hospital, 1330 for a 10 minute checkup in the ER. luckily it was just my deductibles that i have to pay (hopefully). money is so important to be free from the stress of health suddenly disappearing. i'm lucky to have my parents to support me, and i can't imagine what it's like to have no one to turn to for help.

probably the only thing that incentivize me to want to earn more money is for health. as long as i get to do what i enjoy and have my health covered, i don't need anything more.
