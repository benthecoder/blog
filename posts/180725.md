went to salesforce tower for the first time. the view up on the 61st floor is magical. i sat on the tallest tower in SF overthinking and revising over and over again my emails between me and OE. i get so anxious over my emails. i'm worried one wrong sentence or statement and everything crumbles.

i've been feeling like i have a lot of fires to put out, with housing, with breaking the news, and a 3 hour church practice, and revising my AAPM presentation, and the HP work, and with the lease ending, and with selling my things, and the heartburn i've been feeling.

i feel out of breath. i haven't prayed in a while. i want to focus on just one thing. one pursuit. OE. and nothing else for the year. and my blog. i want to catch up with myself again. i haven't taken the time to really ask what i want. conversations with people have been helping. i just know deep down i feel excited about OE. i just hope my stomach gets better soon again.
