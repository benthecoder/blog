Found a good [article](https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/#Overview) for choosing GPUs for deep learning.

Might be handy in the future when I become a deep learning expert.

For now, I'm still a noob.

There's also this [Quora answer](https://qr.ae/py3CuL) which is the best high-level explanation for how GPUs work.

It would be cool to start training deep learning models, I've been wanting to do that since 2020. It's now close to the end of 2023.

It's hard to motivate myself to pursue things that has long term investments, it's also hard to build a habit of learning hard things on your own accord.
