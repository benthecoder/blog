![hyatt regency sf](/images/091125-hyatt-regency.jpg)

flight got delayed because of a government shutdown. the airport was packed. on the plane i did a bit of work, sitting in the emergency exit row this time. after about 3 hours i arrived in sf, took an uber, and checked into the hyatt regency. i passed by this hotel so many times on my way to class, and now being a guest here felt surreal. my room had a view of pier 1, and the layout was unusual. slanted corners and walls that didn't meet at right angles, almost triangular. as if the building settled into an odd shape over time after natural disasters. for dinner i ordered from korean moonbowl. coming back to my room from picking up the takeout food, i stared down at the lobby from the elevators, the atrium stretching below, i get mesmerized by the architecture.
