after 2 hours of sleep, i woke up at 7:30 a.m. i helped cut strawberries and mango for the breakfast. we had it outside in the backyard. this house is really nice for starting a family, or a group of friends. we went to trefethen to get some wine for J's mom. we also tasted some in teh process.

here are my best to worst ranking:

1. Chardonnay
1. SIN Rose
1. OKD five
1. cowgirl and pilot
1. reserve cabernet Sauvignon
1. Dragon's tooth
1. HALO

on the way back we stopped by at oxbow public market. i had the $6.43 dollar california sushi roll, most fresh and best i've every had. we also stopped by at costco for gas. i slept for most of the ride, and i do not reemember much of the journey back. we got home around 7pm

the mafia ate at Yee's. we talked abou 3 things we like and dislike. A is leaving us soon. we are all shaped by each other, some parts more than others. the memories we made in SF will forever stay with us until we grow old.
