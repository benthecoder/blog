i built a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server today for inklink with the mafia.

we first tried to understand what MCP even is, and i learned it's broken down into clients and servers. where clients are the user facing application, and servers are APIs for LLMs to access tools. servers have 3 main components:

1. resources (GET endpoitns to provide context for llms)
2. tools (POST endpoints which performs actions and have side effects)
3. prompts (reusable templates for users to interact with client)

we researched cloud browsers for ai: [browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com) and [hyperbrowser](https://www.hyperbrowser.ai)

and a couple OS ai agents for browsers

- [browser-use/browser-use: Make websites accessible for AI agents](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
- [browserbase/stagehand: An AI web browsing framework focused on simplicity and extensibility.](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand)
- [hyperbrowserai/HyperAgent: AI Browser Automation](https://github.com/hyperbrowserai/HyperAgent)
- [Steel](https://github.com/steel-dev)
- and many more ...

we took a break around 1pm and we had really good tacos called Quesabirria Tacos @ [Cielito Lindo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aKqZWePKcejoNQer8).

we ended up with using hyperbrowser as a tool and our working demo was connecting claude desktop with our mcp server, with one tool that runs hyperbrowser browser use and calling inklink with an ngrok endpoint.

we left the office around 8pm and got home for dinner.

the rest of the night was mlops project.
