There are [two classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsBcdfKfy9o) of geniuses: Peerless and Ordinary.

Einstein was a peerless genius. If we looked at other scientist in his time and field, no one else had comparable productivity or scientific impact to him.

Stephen Hawking is another well-known genius, but there were actually 6 other scientists who had comparable and bigger impact than him.

There was a woman scientist, Renata Kallosh, but there is no news about her anywhere.

But why was Stephen labeled a genius, and not Renata?

Right place, right time.

Throughout history, remarkable individuals were born in the vicinity of big cultural centers.

Exceptional accomplishment alone is not enough.

You have to be born at the right time and the right place, and be with the right people.

People that inspire and influence you to do great things.
