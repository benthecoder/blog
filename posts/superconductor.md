What might be the biggest physics discovery in my lifetime is contained in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008).

Here's the [significance](https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1684044616528453633?s=20) of ambient temperature / pressure superconductor:

- **Lossless electricity transmission** at high voltages and current: 100 billion kWh of electricity are wasted on transmission losses each year in the US alone. That's equivalent to 3 of our largest nuclear reactors running 24/7
- **Easy to create**: LK-99 material can be prepared in about 34 hrs with extremely basic lab equipment
- **New reactor designs**: Nuclear fusion reactors rely on superconductors for plasma confinement. Modern designs use RBCO/YBCO superconductors cooled with LN2 or Liquid He, creating a huge temperature gradient and challenging operation.
- **Room temperature quantum computers**: Quantum computers use superconductors to preserve coherence in qubits. Small changes in temperature and pressure can cause the entire QC to fail during operation.
- **Superconductors batteries**: Simply inject a current and keep it in the coil until you need it. Previously, too costly to maintain.
- **Ultra-efficient computer chips**: 0 resistive losses during operation with superconductors. No need for cooling fans
- everything else: super-cheap MRI machines, MagLev trains everywhere, and a super efficient electric grid
