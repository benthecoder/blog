A true [friend](https://tylerhogge.com/2023/05/19/what-is-a-friend/?curius=2019) are the last 3 levels.

They will fight for you, risking their own safety and image to protect yours.

They tell you hard truths, sacrifice comfort and peace in the relationship for your growth and potential.

They will sacrifice their own life.

To find true friends like this, is to be a true friend yourself.
