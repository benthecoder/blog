i flew to boston with R and E on the same flight w delta. i saw an old woman paint on the plane wiht water colors. when the plane was landing she held hands with her husband sitting across the aisle. i felt a rush of warmth and longing, a glimpse of a future i aspire to have with T. we arrived at the marriot late evening. my room had a beautiful corner window view of boston.
