i did the sql practices on the meta career preparation portal and I'm realizing i can't write basic sql queries. i have a lot of catching up to do. i was having trouble even running my answers in the platform and i learned that it only runs sqlite and was not supporting CTEs. i also started practicing on data lemur. i wonder if i should just practice with AI chatbots like chatgpt at this point, it would be more interactive, with so many questions behind the paywall.

i can imagine someone building a more dynamic and interactive platform where you provide all context about your interview, and it starts providing questions scraped from leetcode premium and 1point3acres, and asks you popular questions from FAANG companies.
