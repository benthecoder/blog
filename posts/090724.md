- i hate the feeling of not understanding something that I should understand after studying it so many times, and the fact that i'm a stats major, why do I not get probability intuitively? i feel anxiety in this class. two homeworks every week and quizzes every thursday is agonizing
- realizing that most of the students in the class are pre smart
- it's so hard for me to talk about sports, i know literally nothing, and 99% of guys likes sports
- i want more friends but i'm too drained to talk to many people (it's only day two Ben take it slow)
- so tired in the second class, i could pass out on the table
- if i speedrun homework and not listen to class, there's really no point being there, also realizing that i might not be able to write these code without googling, so i should probably pay attention
- the library for this campus is a small bookshelf, borrowed "The Power of Experiments" by Michael Luca & Max H. Bazerman
- haven't been to a hackathon since anthropic claude 2, i missed this
- i think i'm better at talking to people now, there's less hesitation and fear to start the conversations, now it's more about how to make sure I'm being a good conversationalist and I'm responding genially like a host
- going up to a group of people and talking is actually not that scary once I do it
- it's so unhealthy whenever I have intense focus on something, and I have to go fast, i forget to breathe and relax, i get tense, my vision narrows, my anxiety increases, and i will stop at no cost until I get it done, forgoing health, physically and mentally
- kept asking questions unapologetically and i won $150 gift card for the unstructured challenge, lets go
- i spoke on stage and I didn't feel anxious at all wow, just felt a bit awkward about the things i was saying
- but i'm still missing energy and liveliness, this takes so much practice, cause it's just so against my nature
- how to manage anxiety but still perform optimally is theÂ hard problem
- almost got hit by a car when i crossed the street checking directions on my phone, I was already halfway on a 4 lane street, i could've been in the hospital wow
- a happy couple holding hands just had to walk in front of me at 10 pm as i'm walking home alone in the cold HUH. i need to be happy for others
- it's just day two of class and I'm already dreading this semester, i feel like i'm going to lose myself in the rapid pace of everything, i'm speedwalking from place to place, rushing homework in class, rushing to the next event/hackathon, rushing my meal preps, rushing everything, everything needs to be done asap, it has to be optimized, so i have time for the next thing, or my own thing.
- opportunity cost is so high here, so many games to play, so little time and energy, it's just this one life
- i forget that i'm only 22 sometimes. what am I chasing? why am I in such a rush?
