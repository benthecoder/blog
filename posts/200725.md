  - "Good ideas can come from anywhere, and it's often not really clear which ideas will prove most fruitful ahead of time. Rather than a grand 'master plan', progress is iterative and uncovered as new research bears fruit"
  - "Teams tend to quickly form around promising ideas as they show promise. There's a strong bias to action—you can just do things."
  - "Everything runs on Slack. There is no email. If you aren't organized, you will find this incredibly distracting."
  - "OpenAI changes direction on a dime. It's much better to do the right thing as you get new information, rather than staying the course just because you had a plan."
  - best practices: "works by default", "keep main clean", "hard to misuse"

  > People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. It’s a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things

  - "God not only ordains the ends of the universe and of human history, but he also ordains the means to those ends"
  - "God works in and through the prayers of his people"
  - "the Lord knows what you need before you ask of it."
  - "what faith is in its essence is trust, and the prayer of faith is a prayer that trusts God for the outcome even if he says no."
