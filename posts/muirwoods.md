I went to [Muir Woods National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/muwo/planyourvisit/hike.htm) today with a bunch of friends.

Parking fee was 9$ and entrance fee was $15.

We drove from Berkeley, passing the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, and it took around an hour with traffic, the road up to the woods was windy.

We did the Bridge 4 back on Hillside [trail](https://www.nps.gov/muwo/planyourvisit/hike.htm), and it took around an hour.

I saw a woodpecker, a lot of butterflies, and a ton of redwoods that split into two, and interesting tree branches.

Muir woods was pretty crowded, and the trails were smaller and packed.

I enjoyed [Henry Cowell Redwoods](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=546) State Park more when I visited with my parents.

It was just a 10$ parking fee and had more bigger redwoods.

The smaller crowd which beget a quieter environment, wider trails, and colder temperature just made me feel more like I was in nature.

The next stop is Big Basin State Park, which the 11-mile Berry Creek Falls Loop has 3 beautiful waterfalls.

There are other [redwood hikes](https://www.7x7.com/the-bay-areas-best-redwood-hikes-1787072017.html) that I hope I get to explore in the future.
