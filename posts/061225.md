walmart has a 90 day return policy. i took an uber to return a couples card game and a ladle that was too huge for me to use. i should read the descriptions next time.

i planned to return them and then get an x-ray done. i'd been holding it off for so long, but google maps had the wrong info. so when i got there, it was closed. i'm wondering how that information even got there in the first place. maybe i should call next time.

i wish a lot of these details in my life could be handled by an AI assistant. it takes so much effort to think about the appointments i have, the places i have to call for PT, for braces, for sports medicine, and it gets messier with moving. i should build out a system to do all this for me.
