woke up to T's voice. struggled to get out of bed. left in a hurry and was reading my notes from remarkable on the way to school. i memorized so many proofs in my head that i'll be forgetting in a few weeks.

went to do my xray on post street. the assistant doing my test was bawling her eyes out and i was confused. i was worried my xray will go wrong, and she would just keep shooting radiation at me, but she held up professionally even though she was suffering through something. i hope she is better now. went to japantown and brought T along. bought kimchi and a big bottle ito en matcha from my two favorite asian grocers.

looked through some books at browser books, found these interesting. i will never not be interested in journal-style writings/memoirs/letters. i'm addicted to capturing and reading about the thoughts in people's head.

- notes on suicide by critchley (i love the blue and white colors by Fitzcarraldo editions)
- the art of memoir by mary karr
- thinking through writing by Kaag and van Belle
- on writing by fitzgerald

went to church for skit practice once more. glad to have this community and have W join. it brings me back to church days in malaysia.
