after mlops class i left for figma conf to meet with my sister. i queued up for almost 3 hours in total for swags. i'm getting them all for T.

in the line for the first swag booth, i talked to a brazilian UX director managing 40 designers under him. he mentioned as a leader, it's tempting to try to solve probelms on your own, instead of delegating them to others.

in the other line, i met some designers from jack rabbit technologies, one guy was an english teacher in japan for a few years, before settling down in durham NC. we conversations about design system, and my sister did her networking.

after the swags and free tacos, i went to marriot to work on the birdclef model. i realized it was because of simple variable case errors which caused the failure on the test set inference.

the rest of the night i was tired and heaty. i went to bed early.
