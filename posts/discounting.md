> Do the most important things first in the day and don’t let anybody stop you. Estimate “most important” using a zero discount rate. Don’t make exceptions. The hours from 7 to 12 are your time to build for the future before the world descends on you.

In economics, a [discount rate](https://www.rff.org/publications/explainers/discounting-101/) is used to assess the present value of future benefits, with a higher rate devaluing distant gains.

A zero discount rate refers to the idea of not diminishing the value of future benefits when assessing the importance of tasks. It emphasizes prioritizing tasks based on their true significance and long-term impact, without devaluing them due to the time it takes to achieve those benefits.

Cowen [suggests](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/09/do-i-wish-to-revise-my-time-management-tips.html) using a "zero discount rate" to evaluate tasks. This means prioritizing tasks based on their importance, regardless of the time it takes to reap the benefits.

Cowen advises focusing on vital tasks early in the day and avoiding exceptions. He emphasizes that the morning hours (7 to 12) are the best time to work on important tasks, free from external distractions.

This also applies to [selecting good projects](https://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/using-zero-discount-rate-could-help-choose-better-projects-and-help-get-net-zero-carbon) that help save the climate.

Where are you reaping short-term benefits because it's easy and it seems important?

What is distracting you from working on something that helps you achieve your long-term goals?
