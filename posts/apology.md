Apologizing is more than just saying you're sorry.

An effective [apology](https://www.vox.com/even-better/23622442/saying-sorry-apologize) has **six (and a half) components** according to Marjorie Ingall and Susan McCarthy, the authors of the book [Sorry, Sorry, Sorry: The Case for Good Apologies](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61273736):

1. the words "I'm sorry" or "I apologize"
2. the **specific reason** you're apologizing; the thing you did
3. an **understanding of why** your actions hurt another person
4. an **explanation for why** you did what you did (but don't make excuses)
5. a **plan** for how you will avoid this infraction again in the future
6. an **offer to** fix what's broken

Finally, <mark>listen to the person you hurt</mark>. That's the half step.
