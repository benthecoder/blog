it's only day 2 of the job application grind and i'm burnout. i keep telling myself that i should fit in just one more application, and it ends up piling, one after the other, and 5 hours passed by and i have no energy to do anything else. i need to leave the house more. i also need to build my job search agent to draft cold emails for me. cold emailing and dm-ing people on twitter is a hack i need to exploit more.
