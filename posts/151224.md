> "It’s the reductionist approach to life: if you keep it small, you’ll keep it under control. If you don’t make any noise, the bogeyman won’t find you. But it’s all an illusion, because they die too, those people who roll up their spirits into tiny little balls so as to be safe. Safe?! From what? Life is always on the edge of death; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues, and a little candle burns itself out just like a flaming torch does. I choose my own way to burn."

hip hurt and i couldn't go church. i was rendered a homebody for the day.

i ended up watching two avengers movie, infinity war and endgame. the last time i watched these were when they were released. they're good movies for passing the time, and the scenes are like eye candy. especially the final battle scene in endgame.

read 'a book of days' by patti smith. i like this idea a lot. it's like the app retro but you only get one picture and one caption for the day. could be a good app idea.

watched gladiator. i did not realize the previous gladiator guy CGI'd into the movie because of an unexpected passing. and this movie was filmed with an unfinished script, yet still won the best picture award. was the final scene was so satisfying. i've been watching so many fight scenes lately, i felt the urge to learn how to fight as well, to protect oneself and others.
