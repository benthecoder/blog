Some [advice](https://www.justbeepit.com/post/saas-startup-founders-what-advice-would-you-give-your-younger-selves-here-s-what-they-said) that Saas startup founders would give to their younger selves.

On doing it again

- genuinely **create value** for society, it's more sustainable and rewarding in long run
- you don't have to go "nuclear big" to be successful
- read and apply "[The Mom test](https://www.momtestbook.com/)", learn how to scale following a customer-based approach

On pitching and selling

- start by providing **professional services** before a product - generate early revenue, validate idea, build early relationships
- Hone **writing skills** \- good writing (influence) is an invaluable marketing tool
- **sell before building** \- generating hype is an artform to master (Product Hunt, Itch, etc.)
- allocate time towards **expanding network** \- attend networking events, within company, etc.

On MVP

- focus on **distriboution & discvery** \- rely less on tech, unless it's revolutionary
- distinguish whether goal is to be **"rich" or "king"** \- rich = raising outside capital at risk of reduced equity and control, king = bootstrapping and maintaining control
- be careful of VCs \- can lose control and focus on business
- right amount for seed - building and validating business plan doesn't require that much money
- set **aggressive ARR** for first year - 500k ARR, path towards raising Series A
- only hire non-founder until PMF - prevents premature scaling and pressure of managing a team

On picking partners/co-founders

- keep in touch with old friendships - already built trust
- find co-founder with B2B sales background - can help you close deals
- hand over marketing to specialists - someone who can diagnose and prescribe the best solution, instead of presenting marketing strategies
- hire **part-time bookkeeper** within $0-1m ARR - then hireh Director of Finance ($1-5m) to manage [AR/AP](https://www.zoho.com/books/articles/accounts-receivable-accounts-payable-guide.html), audits, [ASC 606](https://certinia.com/learn/revenue-recognition/complying-with-asc-606-and-ifrs-15/), financial modelling, key revenue benchmark. After >$5m, hire CFO.
- it takes **7 months** to fully recruit someone - 1 month for interview, 3 months to leave old job, 3 months to ramp up to speed
- create strategy for recruiting people + evaluate performance - hiring legal, financial is easier due to industry guardrails, hiring sales and marketing is harder
- get product off ground != scaling business - most are only needed for a certain phase of time

On looking for what's working

- time and money is usually better spent on ads - hn draw organic traffic, but they just want freebies, ads can help you target and have more reach, increasing conversion rate
- keep on trying - problem often lies in skill gap or tweak in strategy, don't compare to employed friends, it's not freedom
