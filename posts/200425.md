we went to japantown hotel kabuki to help J mock intervew. the sakura festival was happening at the same time. it was too crowded so we went back to chinatown. i finally tried matcha and meiko for the first time. i worked on the synthetic data for my paper at adrian's house. the sugar in the matcha was kicking in and i was jittery. that night was hotpot with mafia, courtesy of A. we talked about our livestreaming app, amongst other things.
