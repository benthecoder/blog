George Orwell wrote the essay "[Why I Write](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/)" (1946) detailing his personal journey to becoming a writer.

He lists "[four great motives for writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_I_Write?useskin=vector)" which he believes exists in every writer.

All are present, but in different proportions that vary from time to time.

1. **Sheer egoism**: "desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc." this is a motive the writer shares with scientists, artists, lawyers - "the whole top crust of humanity"
2. **Aesthetic enthusiasm**: the desire to make one's writing look and sound good, having "pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story."
3. **Historical impulse**: "desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity."
4. **Political purpose**: "no book is genuinely free from political bias", in every person there is a "desire to push the world in a certain direction", even "the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude."

I would consider myself having more historical impulse and aesthetic enthusiasm. I'm leaving artifacts of what I was feeling at different points in my life, preserving my past selves by turning my thoughts into words. It's also therapeutic to make sense of my emotions by writing them out. I'm also capturing specific ideas from blogs and books so I can revisit them in the future and remind myself to apply them in my life. It also helps me to compartmentalize the sheer amount of blogs I have yet to read that are collecting digital dusts in my bookmark folders.

I also strive to make my writing aesthetic; I've been reading more books to emulate the styles of writers that can infuse words with color and sound, reaching into the depths of my soul. By writing about personal and introspective experiences I find valuable, I can [close the taste-skill gap](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish).
