a great way to end the rollercoaster emotion of a week

yakiniQ kbbq with the boys

the ribs were so good. had beer + soju.

karaoke in a korean place

oasis, new jeans, kanye, daniel caesar, billy joel, and ended it with sweet caroline

checked out Temple club. reinforced the fact that i do not like clubs

spent 110 bucks in one day. but it was a good day
