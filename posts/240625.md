went to inklink again for a meeting. after that i toured an apartment with a patio area. the rent is $2700. it was a tad pricey. i decided to hold off on that. the water pressure on the shower head also was a red flag. that's one of the non-negotiables for me. a good shower.

after that we went to farewell party USFCA. i talked to a few people. we talked about job hunting, and scooters and apartments and cats. i had a lot of sweet potato fries.

i finally replaced the glass screen protector on my fuji x100s. it looks like new again. to more photos on this beautiful machinery made in 2013.
