> For so many people, vulnerability is inseparable from fear. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I understood that fear of my mom not picking me up from piano practice was the same fear that flashed through me when a friend or partner answered my text late. This sense of: what in the world am I going to do if you abandon me?

DSA class was MST. flashbacks to the algorithm design class at ISU. that class was pretty interesting, although it's alarming how little i can recall from it. even though i got an A.

free ferry ride to richmond, SF and the two bridges: oakland and golden gate in sight as the skyline slowly reduces to just an outline. the sky purple and pink, the sun turning into a warm fuzzy orange ball. i'm grateful my family is here with me.

went to chinatown night market with family. got [hunan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mstX9iJbT9CTV8Zw8) food

goofy effects on photobooth app with family.

booked another car for tomorrow

continued working on my paper summary app. it's like i'm possessed when i work on a new project. an idea in my head that won't die until i see it come to life. i love building apps. i should start utilizing claude and cursor to make [ios apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7BVmsZSmWQ)

[bridgit mendler](https://youtu.be/H4XqkTx6-fk?si=LY1My19tiaOCBeN_) is such an inspiration. a perfect example of how you can do just do things (given the opportunity and capability), do more side quests, work on interesting and useful problems, do great work.
