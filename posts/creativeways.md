20 easy, mind-expanding ways to be much more [creative](https://www.csun.edu/~vcpsy00h/creativity/define.htm) from The Guardian

1. work across film, photography, print, performance, writing and text, drawing is not the only creative output
2. it's never too late to create, **open yourself to new things** all the way through life
3. **find your space**, it could be walking, driving in silence, your desk, a garden. A space where you're in your own head
4. **get moving**, explore outside in search for inspiration, have a dance party, shake things up
5. **looking is a skill**. being creative is all about looking at the world and taking in information in a different way
6. **keep an ideas notebook** or sketchbook, jot things down when you wake up, throughout the day, and in bed. draw people.
7. **take pressure off** yourself to produce, do something else and trust it will come - it always does
8. take inspiration from others – but know when to look away
9. **learn about the history of art**, artists absorb other artists. if you've discovered a simple idea, it almost always existed
10. consume other culture – comedy, punk bands, articles and posts from friends
11. **use mistakes to your advantage**, perfection is overrated and mistakes are often far more interesting
12. **learn to love your own company**, you spend a lot of time on your own while creating
13. work out what time of the day you get into the zone. study the patterns. maximize on it
14. create close to home
15. work, work, work. artists don't switch off. "it's like a flow I can't turn off", capture the fleeting ideas you don't have the time for now, but later
16. **do something creative everyday**. carry a sketchbook try to sketch each day
17. <mark>Talk to strangers</mark>, your world and insights will open up as you hear a different worldview, even if you don't agree with them.
18. **don't force creativity** – take a break to reset the creative flow, get out of the house and see the world go by, call a loved one, shake out the tension until you're ready to get to it again
19. if all else fails - **do nothing**.
20. be creative without realising. "everybody works in a creative way in order to survive life", "it is part of the human experience"
