> Apophenia: A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works.

It's human nature to try to find causality in everything.

It makes us feel better about the amount of randomness and sporadic events that happen everyday in our lives.

Learn to accept that some things happen just because of nature.

Nature is under no obligation to make sense to us.
