![Central Christian Church austin](/images/071225-ccc-austin.jpg)

i had to catch a flight, so i went to a nearer church today. i'd always wanted to visit central christian church for the architecture, so i got on a waymo and went.

diving into the rabbithole briefly, the church was designed by robert leon white and samuel charles phelps vosper, two architects who were influential in the architectural fabric of texas from the 20s to 50s. the style is romanesque revival, which draws from medieval european romanesque architecture (11th-12th centuries). key features are rounded arches over windows and doors, basilica plans (long nave, aisles). it is reminiscent of old european churches. i found out stanford campus is also romanesque.

after that i boarded the 737 heading to miami. i was on the same flight as R, and we had a short chat before we went our separate ways. i chatted with my uber driver, and he recommended some places i should live in miami and kept repeating that miami is a great place, even though there's no good asian food there. 

i started to have second thoughts about living here long term, but i strive to run towards discomfort instead of shying away. life is too short to stay comfortable, especially not when i'm in my 20s.
