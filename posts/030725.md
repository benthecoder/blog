got my ead card in the mail today + heard back from OE about my onsite interview. i'm not expecting anything. and i'm seeing everything as an added benefit. no pressure. just be myself. do my best. enjoy the process. it's not life or death. if its what God wants for me, it will be mine. relax for the same result.
