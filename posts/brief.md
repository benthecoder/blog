A useful rule when speaking to others is to [be brief, and be positive](https://bakadesuyo.com/2014/01/interesting/).

We like talking about ourselves, and don't realize when we're boring people.

If you're quick to the point and upbeat, it makes it hard for you to be boring.

Always tell the quickest version of your story first. If the other person is interested, they'll ask question.

Then, modulate your story to fit the recipient's interest.

Keep things positive. Even if you disagree with their opinions, there's a chance they might be right, and you could learn something from them.

Being too agreeable is superficial, but brutally honest leads to a miserable conversation.

So, positive disagreement is the middle ground.
