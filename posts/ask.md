Ask for what you want.

I've been doing that by DM-ing people on Twitter a lot.

I'm often surprised by how responsive and kind people are.

I ask for resources/tips for learning Swift

I ask for feedback on startup ideas.

I ask for their lessons and challenges in building projects.

I ask for new features for the products I use.

Whenever I find an interesting person doing something cool, my first knee-jerk reaction is to DM them, I try to come up with thoughtful questions that are generative for both side: I get to learn from them, they get to reflect and reinforce their values and ideas.

Twitter is such a high value platform that I've recommended it to all my friends and family, it's a place where you can create opportunities for yourselves, increase your surface area of luck, meet friends, and shape your future.

I read somewhere that if you can't surround yourself with the people you admire in person, you can do that online. And Twitter is the place I get to do that.
