I read a lot, but I don't really test my knowledge.

A good practice to adopt is that for anything that I've consumed, articles, podcasts or YT videos, summarize it in three sentences.

I'm imagining an LLM app, where for anything you read or learn online, you'll summarize your thoughts and ideas and takeaways, and the LLM will flesh out any details that are still unclear, and provide you with rabbit holes to dive into.
