An interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdEPs-xysak) about love and romance in 20s.

People who date are afraid fo being alone

For those who like being alone, they are scared of dating because it's like the unknown

For those who are scared of being alone, they're fine with dating.

Just because you don't understand their fear, doesn't make your own any less valid.

You have to have some type of independence with yourself.

If you don't have time to yourself, and get fixated on others, you lose sense of your identity.

You need to have your own happiness before you can give happiness to others.
