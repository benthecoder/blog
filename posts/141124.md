woke up feeling like a completely different person. maybe it has something do what with my thoughts the night before. if they're left unresolved, the fears and the anxieties, they dig their way into my subconscious as i'm asleep, without me knowing. i wake up feeling off, like the world is upside down. i wanted to pray before i slept, but i ended up just passing out before i had the chance to quell the emotions. felt so sick and tired after waking up and having breakfast i had to go back to sleep. and i experienced sleep inertia as i woke up. it was very disorientating.

the day fuzzily passed by. all i remember now was eating a lot of chicken and kimchi for late lunch, trying to study for my distributed quiz, attending a few meetings, and bringing my dad to the ymca pool, taking some pictures, and eating steak and salmon with my family.

ended the day with more studying and good conversations.
