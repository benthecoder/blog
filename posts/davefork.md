As part of the Work on Climate Expert [Office Hours](https://workonclimate.org/expert-office-hours/), I had a chance to talk to [Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-fork-8b48901/), a renewable energy technologist at Google.

A few notes on our conversation:

### Book recommendations on energy

- "[The Grid](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26073005)" by Gretchen Bakke (talks about challenges of integrating intermittent renewables into the grid)
- "[Powering in the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12787577-powering-the-future)" by Robert Laughlin (good for energy nerds)
- "[Energy and Civilization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31850765-energy-and-civilization)" by Vaclav Smil (about the role of energy in human civilization)
- "[The Climate Casino](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17802966)" by William Nordhaus (on climate economics and renewable energy)
- "[A Citizen's Guide to Climate Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53119333-the-citizen-s-guide-to-climate-success)" by Mark Jaccard (policy book, also funny)
- [Short Circuiting Policy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48982817-short-circuiting-policy) by Leah Stokes (if you want to get angry about policy)

### Current challenges

- Supplying clean energy for data centers
  - Rapidly growing need for data centers to power large language models
  - Increasing efficiency of these models 100x could prevent devastating CO2 emissions
- Transmission Bottlenecks
  - Building out more high-voltage transmission lines is a major bottleneck
  - Many transmission projects stalled due to "not in my backyard" opposition
  - New wind/solar farms are pointless without transmission to get electricity onto grid
- Intermittency and Weather Forecasting
  - Classic problem of wind/solar being intermittent and mismatched to demand
  - Improved weather forecasting is crucial for optimizing renewable dispatch
  - More predictive capability through better weather models is imperative
- [Optimal Power Flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimal-power-flow) (OPF) Modeling
  - Solving OPF problem is key for grid operators to avoid overloads/blackouts
  - OPF models determine optimal electricity flows during periods of energy scarcity
  - Understanding OPF is valuable for using computing/software for renewable integration
- Overall grid management challenges
  - Intermittency of renewables coupled with transmission constraints
  - Inability to perfectly predict and match supply/demand
  - Must be overcome for effective integration of high levels of renewables

### Role of Nuclear Energy

- We have to build a lot more nuclear power plants. Nuclear power provides stable baseload power and is one of the safest forms of electrical power generation
- It produces a tiny amount of nuclear waste, which can be managed despite opposition
- Once built and paid off, nuclear plants can last 100 years and provide inexpensive, stable power
- The [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_France?useskin=vector) have perfected building nuclear plants cost-effectively, achieving economies of scale and low carbon intensity
  - as of Dec 2023, they generate 2/3 of electricity from nuclear.
  - they have one of the lowest CO2 emissions per unit of [electricity](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) in the world at 85g of CO2/kWh, compared to global average of 438.

### on Fusion

- Dave spent 5 years working on fusion energy at Google, mostly exploring ideas that didn't pan out
- [Commonwealth Fusion Sciences](https://cfs.energy/), an MIT startup, has a promising approach combining high-temperature superconductivity with toroidal [Tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) fusion
- Their approach is based on well-understood models, making it more predictable and engineerable
- However, fusion is still at an early stage, similar to solar energy in the 1950s before silicon cells became practical
- Fusion may be viable for future generations, but serious decarbonization efforts can't rely on it in the near-term

### what he wished people knew more about energy

- energy in food
  - You can put food into a calorimeter and figure out its energy content in joules.
  - For a potato, if you burn it in a calorimeter, you'll find out how many joules of energy it contains.
  - You can then trace back how many joules of fossil energy it took to produce that potato.
  - Divide the fossil energy input by the food energy output, and you get a dimensionless ratio in joules per joule.
  - For a potato, it's something like one quarter of a joule of fossil energy per joule of food energy, so a 4 to 1 ratio.
  - That's not great that fossil energy is still burned to make a potato, but at least it's 4 joules out for every 1 in.
  - If you look at the American diet on average, it's about 8 joules of fossil energy per joule of food energy.
  - So the American diet is about 30 times worse than just eating potatoes in terms of embedded fossil energy.
- energy in air travel
  - He's happy Google Flights shows you the tons of CO2 emitted for flight routes.
  - People should especially avoid short flights, as a lot of emissions come from the energy expended in the climb to cruising altitude.
  - For short flights, planes may never reach that cruising altitude before descending.
  - Long distance isn't good either, as it burns more fuel over a longer distance.
  - If people were more aware, we'd have electrified high-speed rail networks which are much easier to decarbonize than air travel.
  - Airplanes running on batteries are either too heavy or too short range currently.

### imparting words

- get to know your neighbors and the people around you
- volunteer for a nonprofit / start your own like Dave
- Dave started his own nonprofit that he volunteers for
- <mark>find joy and happiness close to home</mark> and in their own communities, this can make communities stronger and happier
- The implication is that being engaged locally and finding fulfillment in one's community can lead to lower climate impacts from factors like reduced consumption, travel, etc.
