A collection of interviews on hard work.

[Richard Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA)

> There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics, to imagine the electromagnetic field, that comes without practice and reading and learning and study.
>
> If you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a large amount of time to study and work and thinking and mathematics and timeline, then he's become a scientist

[John Carmack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4)

> There's a small subset of people that can be obsessive about things. Obsession can get things done that just practical prudent pedestrian work won't, or at least won't, for a very long time.

[Kevin Systrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pvpNKUPbIY)

> There's no way you can expect changing the world without working very hard. Even people who changed the only nudged the world in a slight direction. To have great outcomes you need to work 3 standard deviations above the mean.

[Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0)

> The focus should be more on how much you do. Pick the things you're interested in and spend 10,000 hours.
