> The older I get, the more I find that you can only live with beings who liberate you, and who love you with an affection that is as light to bear as it is strong to feel… This is how I am your friend, I love your happiness, your freedom, your adventure…and I would like to be for you the companion you are sure of, always.

spent the day studying BERT and attention. Umar and 3b1b was very helpful to visualize everything.

i'm thinking of an app that can let me select the photos i've taken for the day, and it takes the image and metadata, and helps summarizes what i did for the day. helps me with my journal reflection, and also incentivize me to take more photos.

giving is always better than receiving, gift giving is an art, and the quality of your gift is a direct result of how attentive you are to your curiosity, to the bids for connections, the little things, and the inside jokes.

> it is more blessed to give than to receive" – Acts 20:35
