the last day with t in austin. it was a few dreamy days that made austin a pleasant place to live. in the uber with her we held on to the final few moments we shared in the same space, breathing the same air, hearing the same sounds. time was against us, and she was already risking it by arriving only a few moments before her flight boards. i was worried she won't make it. i stayed at the airport till she got in the plane. i was worried, but also secretly hoping she could stay one more day.
