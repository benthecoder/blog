first time in the SF office. it's my first time in the office where one of the big C was in the house. once the rest of the people arrived, we all gathered to decide what everyone would be working on. i was asked when i could finish my feature. i had just started building out the skeletons for the app over the weekend, nothing had been reviewed, and i had no idea how to publish it. 

after a slight hesitation, and mountains of pressure, i answered wednesday, which was 2 days. don't get me wrong, i like setting ambitious goals for myself, and no deadline at this company is ever realistic, but this was the most intense deadline ever. i do like deadlines though, it gives me clarity. i become hyperfocused on getting this specific task done within an amount of time. i evaluate all the trade-offs and keep only what is necessary.

dinner with E, S and R at Pazzia Ristorante Italiano. conversations don't flow smoothly and there are awkward pauses, but i got to know them a little bit better.
