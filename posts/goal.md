The most important step of every great conversation is to enter it with a goal in mind.

Ask yourself before the conversation what is the best possible outcome for yourself and the other party, and create a plan to get closer to that outcome.

Here are some healthy and unhealthy conversation goals:

1. Finding the truth
1. Building and strengthening relationships
