i went to the office. this time there's a couch, a huge gorilla art, and more people there, so it's less quiet.

i had a meeting today with the two big Cs and other sales people discussing the feature i built and how to price it. it's cool to be part of these meetings. i get to learn how D thinks, and he's very sharp-minded about things. it's intimidating always sitting in those meetings. i never have the courage to speak up about stuff because i just see myself as a kid who's doing all the grunt work. but i did my research as well. i looked into clinical trials in the US, especially this paper: [The Case for Clinical Trial Abundance](https://ifp.org/the-case-for-clinical-trial-abundance/). i do think i need more time digesting the ideas there before i can speak of them.

after the meeting i left immediately to meet up with T. i'd set her location to arrive at the office, and we went back home together.

after that we had a TJ haul. we got berries, baking soda, oat milk vanilla, almond powder, non dairy yogurt, almond butter, a dozen eggs, vanilla extract, okra snack, crackers, and cinnamon powder. most of them for T to make the banana cake she likes to make for me. full of excitement for the week ahead together.
