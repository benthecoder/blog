I went to my first [meetup](https://www.linkedin.com/events/magicmeetup-in-persondataengine7067220027619364864/) in SF today.

I always wanted to go to one of these, and I'm glad I got the opportunity.

It was also my first time in a [bar in SF](https://alchemistsf.com/), and this bar had a nice atmosphere inside.

The free food was awesome, I was addicted to the Truffle Honey Grilled Cheese.
