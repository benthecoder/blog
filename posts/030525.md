i ran through all the code for my research in the server.

i tried to do three things at once:

1. the birdclef kaggle challenge (tried to install CUDA on windows but failed)
2. papertrail local document classification with phi3:mini, moondream, and qwen3 0.6b
3. research code

i got so burnt out i forced myself to leave to buy groceries 30 min before all the shops close. i wanted to go gym at 3pm but time went by so fast when code does not work.

i had the worst brain fog from 12 to 4pm. i remember staring at my computer, trying to figure things out, thinking about the steps to take, but unable to even move my fingers.

i should stop context switching.
