The [fundamentals of spatial design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/) by Apple WWDC23, best practices for creating comfortable, human-centered experiences that transforms reality.

1. **Familiar**
   - use familiar elements like sidebars, tabs, search field; provides consistency
   - place interfaces within windows people are used to.
   - Use points to size interface elements so they adapt across distances
2. **Human-centered**
   - consider people's wide field of view and use landscape layouts
   - design for ergonomics by placing content at comfortable viewing angles and distances that encourage good posture
   - minimize required movement, ex: press and hold digital crown to recenter app
3. **Dimensional**
   - use available space, don't limit to physical room
   - use depth for hierarchy and focus, nearby objects feel tangible, far away feels impressive. (ex: playback control is a nearby element compared to screen)
   - reinforce depth with lighting and shadows to appear realistic (ex: screen shines light onto nearby objects, objects casts shadows, grounding them)
   - prefer subtle depths, (ex: use for contrasting modals)
   - explore small and large scale (ex: movies should be large and impressive, shopping products should be real-life scale)
4. **Immersive**
   - immersion spectrum: from shared spaces to full spaces, can take people to new places, or still show their surroundings
   - guide focus to avoid overwhelming people
   - blend thoughtfully with surroundings using soft edges, lighting, shadows. Anchor content
   - add liveliness with subtle animation (water rippling and clouds)
   - create atmosphere with spatial audio
   - avoid large fast movements, fade out content when moving, and back in when settled
   - provide clear entry and exit to immersive experience with recognizable icons like expand/collapse arrows
5. **Authentic**
   - Identify key interactions, perspectives or moments that can be experienced spatially (ex: viewing panorama, seeing pictures at real-life scale) with rich visuals and high-fidelity audio, make things feel real.
   - Make use of space and immersion for creativity, focus, or evoking feelings

The video shows a lot of cool examples for these concepts.

I can't wait for the day where I own a [Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/), and interact with the web in a completely different way.
