We possess a fundamental concept of self. We are aware of our names, our parents, and the milestones of our lives, such as our successes and failures. However, truly grasping our self-concept extends well beyond the mere facts of our personal history.

Self-concept is deeply intertwined with our self-esteem. It reflects in our belief in our capabilities to overcome challenges, to contribute positively to our world, and in our capacity for self-transformation. These aspects of self-concept are influenced by personal history, but according to Dr. Paul Conti, an individual can enhance their **agency** and ability to achieve goals through a deeper understanding of their self-concept.

### How do we achieve this deeper understanding?

One effective method is to consciously and deliberately construct a [life narrative](https://youtu.be/CJIXbibQ0jI?si=mtY8J3gJ91xo_4Nb&t=5214).

### What is a Life Narrative?

The process involves dividing your life into 3-5 year segments. Within these periods, note down in bullet points the life events that seem significant to you. This could encompass hobbies, work experiences, pivotal relationships, personal challenges, or anything else that stands out in your memory. These events could be either positive or negative, or even neutral experiences that continue to resonate with you.

### What to include?

It's crucial to include moments that you fear you might forget, moments that you believe define you. The aim isn't to draft a seamless life story, but to create a collage of vital personal experiences.

### Developing a Historical Sense of Self

By documenting these life segments, you cultivate a historical sense of self, which contributes to your understanding of your past, present, and potentially, your future. This historical sense grounds you in the flow of time and reveals the extent of your commitment to various pursuits at different stages of your life.

### Recognizing Patterns

This narrative can illuminate persistent patterns in your work or relationships, helping you discern whether these patterns are beneficial. It's not about setting goals; it's about discerning a structured pattern in your narrative.

### Am I on the right path?

By reviewing your life narrative, you can evaluate if you're on the course you desire. It helps you understand the journey that has led you to where you are today.
