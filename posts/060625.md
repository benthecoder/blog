i need to get my hands on the entire cs lewis collection. and i have to finish all of them. and more so, i should put into practice the teachings in his books.

A DS question i found: [Should you ask data science job candidates this tricky math question? – r y x, r](https://ryxcommar.com/2023/06/26/should-you-ask-data-science-job-candidates-this-tricky-math-question/)

started to develop the papertrail app david wants with tauri, but i kept facing bugs. rust is difficult.
