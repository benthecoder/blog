did a short photowalk from chinatown library to ina coolbrith. there's a point on mason st (somewhere between vellejo to union) where you're on higher elevation, and all the way down the street, can see the ferris wheel and alcatraz. and on your right as you walk down mason st, you can also see the oakland bridge, the transamerica, and ships carrying cargo. it's especially pretty during the sunset.

sat on the bench at ina coolbrith at felt immense peace, probably the first time since coming here. nobody else was around so i got the view all to myself. i could see tiny humans walking in the city, the cars on the road, ships on the bay. everything felt so small. it's like that feeling where you're watching earth from space. a pale blue dot. my mind was blank. i had no anxiety or worries. no longing or sadness. it was a unique experience.

went back to the library to work on the cheatsheet, got a few books that i plan to read over the christmas holiday since i have no plans yet. i barely read anything since coming to SF, i hope to catch up on reading during the break.
