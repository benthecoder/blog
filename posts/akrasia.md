[Akrasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia?useskin=vector), "lacking command" or "weakness" is a lack of self-control or acting against one's better judgement.

If you struggle with motivation, it's likely the problem is not [intrinsic](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rbXoZFWdwaP4pW9hu/intrinsic-motivation-is-crucial-for-overcoming-akrasia) to you, but instead you haven't found work that is interesting.

If you find your work boring, you should be doing something else.

Some examples:

### Steve Jobs

> I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And **the only way to do great work is to love what you do**

### Bill Thurston

> My attention is more inward than that of most people: it can be resistant to being captured and directed externally. Exercises like these mathematics lessons were excruciatingly boring and painful (whether or not I had "mastered the material"). I used to think my wandering attention and difficulty in completing assignments was a defect, but now I realize my **"laziness" is a feature, not a bug**

### Scott Alexander

> I’ve written a few hundred to a few thousand words pretty much every day for the past ten years. But as I’ve said before, this has taken exactly zero willpower. **It’s more that I can’t stop even if I want to**.

### Paul Graham

> Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost **impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in**. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.
