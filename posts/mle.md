It's my last statistics class for my bachelor's degree, and my midterm is tomorrow, these are some resources I found for these concepts.

Method of Moments and Maximum Likelihood Estimation are two methods for [estimating](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/1) [parameters](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/1/1.1) of a [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution).

### MoM

Basic Idea: equate sample [moments](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/04/11/moments) with the respective [theoretical](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2379647/difference-between-theoretic-moment-and-sample-moment-and-understanding) moments E(X^k), k=1,2,3.... , until you have as many equations as parameters, and solve for the parameters.

### MLE

Basic idea: maximize likelihood of data to estimate unknown parameter ùõâ. Find L(ùõâ), log-likelihood it to make it easier to work with, differentiate it, set it to 0, and solve for ùõâ.

### MoM vs MLE

MLEs can be shown to be [asymptotically efficient](https://www.statistics.com/glossary/asymptotic-efficiency/), but MLEs require more assumptions. The best tool depends on the situation.
