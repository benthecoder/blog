It's the beginning of June.

I'm about to graduate at the end of the year.

There are so many possibilities ahead of me that it's dizzying.

I could either do a masters, start working full-time, or go back to Malaysia.

Each of which completely changes the trajectory of my life.

When asked about what I want to do with my life, I always say the same thing.

Work at big tech for a few years, earn some money, found a startup with friends, then go to Europe/Canada eventually and live there permanently.

I like to plan things, to know what to expect.

But life after graduation has so my variables that it's not possible to plan.

So right now I'm just taking the next best step, living life one day at a time.

I'm also actively trying to steer towards the right path. I could use my free time to build up my skills, code more side projects, and that could open up more doors for my life.

But a balance of the two would be ideal.

How would I know that the path I'm on now is the right one in the first place?

And how would I know which path is the right one to take next?

[John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkn8MS3n8Q) has some good advice: study broadly and without fear, and surround yourself with people you like and make cool stuff with them.

Studying without fear is important because if you study things just because other people are doing it, that's out of fear: fear of missing out, fear of falling behind the hype train.

But if you're studying out of your own curiosity, passion and just for the fun of it, I believe that will guide you down the right path.

I'm lucky to be in the Bay Area this summer, there are so many interesting people around me.

John's right in saying what you do isn't nearly as interesting or important as who you do it with.
