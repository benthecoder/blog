Steve Jobs was a master communicator and storyteller.

His introduction of [The iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7qPAY9JqE4) from MacWorld 2007 is a quintessential example of his ability to articulate ideas effectively.

Vicky Zhao shares in her [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkPfdR80u_8) that the key is to know the answer to 4 questions.

These questions were inspired by Aristotle's 3 elements of persuasion - Logos, Pathos, and Ethos.

The questions are:

1. What do you want people to **do**? (end goal)
2. What do I want people to know about **me**? (Ethos)
3. What do I want people to know about the **topic**? (Logos)
4. What do I want people to **feel**? (Pathos)
