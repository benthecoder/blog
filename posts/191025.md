had a bit of free time as things slowed down.

i added a few things to my blog

- a [heatmap](/posts) like the github commits graph, but of my posts, and the shades represent length of my posts.
- a spotify listening [activity](/now), showing current, and recent 3 songs
- and a [umap](/viz) plot of posts embeddings
- backfilled tags by asking claude code to read all my posts

claude code is amazing. what can it NOT do?
