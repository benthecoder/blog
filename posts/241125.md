today was one of the most stressful days of my life. it was supposed to be just another monday, but things slowly descended into [chaos](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/gitlab-discovers-widespread-npm-supply-chain-attack/). my colleagues brought order back, and i watched them in awe as they tackled the issue methodically and calmly, as one by one they triaged and contained the attack.

i learned a lot that day about how easily something can be taken away. i lost access to everything. i learned how to handle a crisis like this. i felt embarrassed and guilty and like a victim at the same time.
