went to IEC service after 2 weeks, i've brought my family to so many churches at this point in the US, meeting different uncles and aunties. churches are a great environment.

malaysian pastor has so much in common with fam, same primary school, same high school as sis, same neighborhood.

never been to pier 39 close to winter, christmas tree and decorates are nice. the seals have decreased in amount during this time. watched a subpar magician perform.

been getting so tired around 6 pm these days. an utter and complete exhaustion where i can't stay awake a second longer.

got delivery green curry from million thai in tenderloin, cheap prices for SF.

have not been able to get much progress for the research question, it's been lingering in my head the past few days, and claude has helped but i haven't had time to truly sit down and work through the papers and theory.
