i felt dizzy and more sick than yesterday. missed all my classes, an opt workshop, and free food at a taco restaurant. devastating. i decided to clean everything up. my desk, my luggage, my bed sheets, swept and mopped my room. cooked chicken soup and this time i still had soup to drink which is nice. my new room layout is perfect, i can turn off my desk lights and ports in bed. i can also leave my laptop on the table while i facetime T. i felt comfort and peace and happy.
