A [checklist](https://twitter.com/lennysan/status/1691918945522204680?s=20) by Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng for what a great startup idea needs to hit.

- Is this a [hair on fire](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/the-real-product-market-fit/) problem?
- [Unit economics](https://www.paddle.com/resources/unit-economics) must be great (i.e. profitable on frst sale)
- Is there existing budget for this solution? Or are you selling into a decision-maker who has a lot of budget to throw around?
- What is your [wedge](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/wedge)? ie. what is the clear distribution strategy we will start with?
- Is it recurring revenue and selling to businesses (i.e. B2B SaaS)?
- Is this really sticky /core and super hard to rip out?
- Is the [ACV](https://visible.vc/blog/annual-contract-value/) large enough to sell to even smaller companies (30-100 person) and have it be worthwhile?
- Why is now the right time to start the company?
- Does it pass the "bomb' test?
- What is the barrier to entry? Is this a defensible business model? I.e. is it sticky?
- What data do you generate? How can you use that data to build a moat?
- What is the competitive landscape? Is this 10x better than anything else out there?
- We should not have significant platform risk
- Does this require approval from just one function? e.g. Is there single player mode?
- Is the ROI to save money or make more money crystal clear?
- Is there an existing large company that you can point to in this space?
