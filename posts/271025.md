i walked to campus with T, albeit having trouble with my SI joint, she was patient and matched my speed. stayed at the suzzallo to get some work done while she had her meeting. then we got the food panda like chinese food at the cafeteria. it was close to 20 bucks, more expensive that i would've imagined. i stayed around at the dining area, as she left for her class, then moved to the hall area at the union building. after her class was done we went home together in a lyft.
