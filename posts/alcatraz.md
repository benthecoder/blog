> Break the rules and you go to prison. Break the rules in prison and you go to Alcatraz.

Went for the Alcatraz Night tour today.

Had an Old Fashioned Angus burger beside the Alcatraz Landing.

We boarded at 6:30 p.m., and reached the island at 6:50.

The whole island was surrounded by fog which made it spooky.

There are a lot of seagulls everywhere, and it smells unpleasant as well, but you get used to it soon.

It starts with a short hike up into the prison, and you'll come across a water tower, and a small morgue.

Then you'll enter into the prison through a small door, and a poster on the wall saying

You get a cell phone with a play/pause button, and it contains realistic audio of the metal clanging of cell doors in the prison, audio of the ex-inmates, and more.

I got to explore the cells, the yard, the solitary room, the dining area, hospital, administration, etc.

I also got to see replicas of the 3 prison inmates who escaped Alcatraz. You see the fake heads in their cells. Having watched escape from alcatraz, it was pretty cool to see it in person.

It was fun to go with friends, there were 10 of us across 3 friend groups.

We left the island at 8:55 p.m.
