i didn't earn any income in the past year during my masters. so taxes were a lot simpler. i just had to file the 8843 document. i went to USPS with A to mail the tax forms. i had to google what to write on the front of the letter. an american woman arrived 5 mins after USPS closed, she tried to enter the building, but a worker told her it's closed. the woman proceeded to argue that people were still in the building, and she was frustrated, she banged on the door a few times and left in anger. i don't think that behavior is something i will ever see in asia.
