i spent most of the day at home to cook my chicken soup. after lunch i went to the library to get some leetcode in. then went to YMCA to finish up homework because the library closes at 6pm. i found a good github repo for [ML interview questions](https://github.com/khangich/machine-learning-interview). i was struggling to finish my homework, i just keep thinking about how much time i'm "wasting" while i could be interview prepping to get a job that pays 200k a year.
