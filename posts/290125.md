> "When I speak of poetry I am not thinking of it as a genre. Poetry is an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality." – Andrei Tarkovsky

past 3 weeks was rough. i felt like my entire life was devoted to that abstract. and i'm glad it had a positive end, and i get to continue working on it into a full manuscript.

had my school meeting and my professor meeting. i'm still bad at receiving compliments. it feels like the calm after the storm. there's exciting work to be done ahead. i'm enjoying this internship so much. even though there isn't $50/hr pay and free food and an expensive office space with big monitors, i get good mentorship and interesting problems to solve.

napped a lot after the meetings. didnt leave house at all today which is bad. i need more excuses to go out and take more walks. a sedentary lifestyle is dangerous especially at my age because the effects will build up over time, and future me will be the one facing the consequences.
