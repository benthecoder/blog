From [Dr. Julie Gurner](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-2-2023/):

> "I think that there are two ways of looking at things that have happened to you. You can be a victim or you can be a survivor. Those are two very different cognitive positions. You canâ€™t control what happens to you in either circumstance, but one is very powerful. You have overcome."

GERD happened to me, and for some time, I felt helpless, and I still do.

I feel trapped in this body that I want to replace.

My soul wants to do things that my body cannot.

I see myself as a victim, like getting caught in a deadly accident on a normal Sunday, and forever not like yourself ever since.

It's time I reframe that experience.

To tell a different story, to rewrite the narrative that I play over and over in my head.

To rewrite it to survivorship and (the process of) overcoming it, and what it takes.

I need to realize the things I sacrificed, the naivety I lost, the wisdom I gained, the bitterness I swallowed, the pain I endured to be the person I am today.

I need to tell myself I am a survivor, and that every new day is my surviving and thriving given the circumstances.

I am not a victim, I'm a survivor.
