i spent the morning prepping for interview, then went to school before lunch so that i don't fall asleep on my table. the seminar was about RAG from an AWS dev advocate. i couldn't pay attention at all even though it might've been insightful and useful information. studied LC and the class content simultaneously. had a short quiz at the end which i almost could not solve because i was panicking. i'm worried this would be my interview. i have to learn how to control my nerves. our mlops group project is about turning 2d images into 3d models. we've been using [trellis](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/trellis) on fal.ai. the idea is, we can generate these 3d characters just by drawing them/describing them, and these 3d characters can interact in a digital world on three.js, and we can use voice to control these characters.
