> data outlives code. evals outlive models.

distributed class was mongodb. i forgot what i was doing but i could not focus in class at all.

aj borrowed me prince of persia stripe press book, that made my day. i'm excited to read it. it resembles my blog, daily snippets into my life. i look forward to extracting some techniques for how to better journal my days, i'm still lacking a clear structure for my entries.

charles came to give a modal talk. main takeaways are below

- why have conrol over inference? data security, hackability and integration, logprobs, sparse autoencoders
- inferece is high math and high memory bandwidth
- there are two types: prefill-oriented (think 1000+ documents into gemini 2.0) and decode-oriented tasks (think reasoning like deepseek r1), and one of these are usually slower
- inference considerations: pick hardware (NVIDIA), building eval, model selection, serving inference, integration, observation
- GPU embraces memory latency and gives up control, they maximize memory bandwidth
- math computations are simple, it's memory that lags 1000x compared to math operations
- VRAM is the primary constrained resource, always quantize!
- weight vs activation quantization
- continuous batching and speculative decoding

spent 2 hours more than necessary on SQL homework. two hours i will never get back in my life because the assignments are not well structured and i had to ask a lot of clarifying questions. i guess this is considered interview prep because you have to always clarify in interviews.

went back to indonesian church after so long, it's nice to be back. the last time was when my parents visited in late november. the pastor talked about marriage. he was the most entertaining pastor i've listened to in so long. some bible verses that are important to note down:

- 2 Cor 6:14-15: "do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness"
- Ephesians 5:31-32: "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church."
- Genesis 2:18: “The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.””
- Amos 3:3 "can two walk together unless they have agreed to do so?"
- marriage as a reflection of the relationship between christ and the church, not just you and your spouse
- this unity requires a shared purpose of glorifying God, which is challenging if one partner does not believe in Christ.
- marriage requires alignment in values, faith, and life goals
- believers share a common foundation in scripture that guides their marriage
- challenges in marrying unbeliever
  - conflict in values and priorities
  - challenges in raising children
  - hindrance to spiritual growth
  - negative spiritual influence
