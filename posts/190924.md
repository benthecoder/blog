back to the assignments and quiz grind again

headache was so bad in stats class i felt nauseas. i think i have tmj. or i grind my teeth at night. my temples are being squeezed so badly.

went to a cohere meetup, wanted to check it out for a bit because i still had homework due, had interesting conversations. still trying to figure out what i want to work on and what my interests are. was asked what my dream company is and i always say apple by default. but there are so many cool companies to work at, the other FAANGs (Google, Microsoft, Meta), the unicorns (Instacart, Airbnb, Asana), and the interesting ones (Huggingface, Watershed, AllenAI, Cohere, etc.)

Had a new idea for a chrome extension for my communications project,

I call it Aha: a chrome extension for explaining anything

a napkin sketch and resources i discovered while researching

- highlight phrase to ELI5
- pass context of article
- action: command/ctrl + ?
- guardrail for query
  - limit the length some how
  - let users customize the prompt
- prompt for eli5
  - `given this term: <TERM>. Explain under 100 words like I'm 5 years old`
- send call to [cerebras](https://inference.cerebras.ai/) llama 3.1 80b
- stream the response in a popup box on window / under extension
- button for more resources
- send API call to [exa.ai](https://exa.ai/search)
  - `useful learning resources and explainers for <TERM>`
- display in textbox
- copy output
- button to open all tabs

future work

- support PDFs?
- store historical calls in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
