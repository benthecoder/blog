went to one medical on Congress Ave for my SI joint. the decor was nice, almost like it was carefully and strategically chosen to induce peace and safety. the wifi password was GiveThanks. i liked that.

i gave the spiel about my condition, and got a referral to a sports medicine doctor at UT Austin Health. i'm so grateful to have health insurance. if i was still stuck in iowa under a student's insurance, i would be handed tylenol and pray for it to go away.
