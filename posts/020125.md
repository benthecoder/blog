![Experimentation books in the MSDS library](/images/experimentbooks.jpg)

tried my best to stay awake in the 3 hour lecture. the senior data scientist positions in causal inference and experiments are all enticing but they seem very remote, i can't enter a job like that straight out of college. it feels like i'm most suited for an ai engineering role or data science product analytics, but for the former, i need to work on more open source and classic rag and agents projects, and for the latter i need to build product sense and deep dive into consumer apps. so many possibilities. which excites me the most?

made a few first steps in the hackathon. school verbally agreed to help with venue and food. now to reach out to all the connections we've made in sf so far.

went to costco for grocery run. got chicken drumsticks this time instead of the chicken thighs, i got tired of removing the bones and skins.

read a few pages of in praise of shadows on the bus. i have to finish this book asap before the sfpl starts honking at me again for not returning the book on time.

helped rewrite T's SOP. i like seeing words and paragraphs becoming more concise. the act of condensing words, yet still maintaining meaning and context. it's satisfying.

reached pg 26. of in praise of shadows. a few new things i've learned: japanese lacquerware (lacquer is a shiny coating applied to wood or metal, made from resin extracted from trees), Yōkan (羊羹), Nō and Kabuki (japanese dance-dramas), eaves (the wide overhanging of a roof) and veranda (the outdoor space of a japanese building/temple).
