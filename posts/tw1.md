- picked up the climate book by gates after so long
- power lines underground cost more because they get hot and can melt because they cannot dissipate heat as compared to above ground
- nuclear fusion vs fission, one is hydrogen -> helium, the other is splitting heavier atoms like uranium
- fusion is much safer because chain reactions won’t occur, and it can only happen if you keep pumping it fuel, it also produces much less waste
- fission is currently used the most in France
- fusion is still decades away because the amount put in is still higher than the amount you get
