![Mom's meal](/images/070126-momsmeal.jpg)

meetings about CT and business review. got overwhelmed by everything needed to get it out. my mind kept racing and i kept getting switched between contexts until it felt like it was going to burst. i was scatter-brained.

one negative pattern i want to kill this year is my tendency to believe that if there's a deadline or an urgent task to complete, i can just power through it and strap myself down in front of my laptop and the answer will just appear. if i just grind on the problem, i'll get everything done.

but what i'm finding in reality is that i just get more and more overwhelmed and the problems dance around my head, taunting me. i need to learn how to handle urgent pressure while still delivering quality work and, most importantly, taking care of my health.
