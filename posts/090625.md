i went to Sentul to renew my passport with my mom. we went to klcc after that, and i bought my ecco shoes. they cost RM700. prices are so large in malaysia that it's hard to swallow when buying things, but after converting it, and realizing it's $160 dollars, it made it easier. went to kinokuniya to browse the current releases. i remember how i sat down to finish the stranger by camus here. it made me want to learn french so i can read the book in french. after getting home, i was on youtube. i watched a [short](https://youtube.com/shorts/2sAxZdyUBI8?si=BmhWmPn3EWBFhtn0) about homemade tofu. turns out you only need this ingredient: Glucono-Î´-lactone, a.k.a GDL.
