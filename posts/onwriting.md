A living document containing advice on writing

### Politics and the English Language

George Orwell

> 1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> 1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> 1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> 1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> 1. Never use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or jargon if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> 1. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

### Stephen King

> 1. Get to the point.
> 1. Write a draft. Then let it rest.
> 1. Cut down your text.
> 1. Be relatable and honest.
> 1. Don’t care too much what others may think.
> 1. Read a lot.
> 1. Write a lot.

### The Age of the Essay

Paul Graham

> An essay begins with a question. You notice a door that’s ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what’s inside.
>
> Surprise the reader by telling them something they always knew deep inside but didn’t bother to do the work to make it conscious.
>
> Collect surprises. It’s a trainable skill. The more anomalies you’ve seen, the more easily you’ll notice new ones.
>
> Pay attention to things you’re not supposed to. If you’re curious about something, trust your instincts. Don’t believe what you’re supposed to.
>
> Expressing ideas helps to form them. In a real essay you’re thinking out loud.
>
> Writing something that other people will read forces you to think well.
>
> Don’t plan. From paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their course. Real thought is full of false starts. An essay is a cleaned-up train of thought.
>
> Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting.
>
> Aim for maximum surprise – things you didn’t know that contradict things you thought you knew. What surprises you?
>
> Ask ‘why’ about things that feel off. That’s where fruitful material is.
>
> Read it out loud and fix everything that doesn’t sound like conversation.
>
> Ask reviewers for two things: which parts bore them, and which seem unconvincing.
>
> Cut the boring bits.
>
> Make unconvincing bits more clear, or change what you’re saying if you’re wrong.

### Bertrand Russell's Writing Rules

> 1. A style is not good unless it is an intimate and almost involuntary expression of the personality of the writer, and then only if the writer’s personality is worth expressing.
> 1. There are some simple maxims-not perhaps quite so simple as those which my brother-in-law Logan Pearsall Smith offered me-which I think might be commanded to writers of expository prose. **First**: never use a long word if a short word will do. **Second**: if you want to make a statement with a great many qualifications, put some of the qualifications in separate sentences. **Third**: do not let the beginning of your sentence lead the reader to an expectation which is contradicted by the end.
> 1. Your writing is never as good as you hoped; but never as bad as you feared.
