today i went back to my parents' hometown to visit my popo. she's the only connection to my past left on both sides of my family.

first we arrived at her house and my mom was my translator, as we asked her questions about what she remembers about our family history, what my great grandfather did, where they came from, how life was when the japanese were here. even my mom learned a few things. i have to thank T's mom for inspiring this.

we had lunch together at a chinese restaurant with AC. i like 上汤啦啦 and 芋头扣肉. after lunch we went back to her home and continued to chat. but the house was warm and air was sticky and i fell asleep. wi also fell asleep on the drive home.

we ended the day with kbbq for fathers day. and i played played assasins creed on the hp monitor.
