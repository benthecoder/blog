we arrived at spc at 11 a.m. i continued working on the front-end and deployed the game library. little things matter, like a sound effect when you hover over a button and when you click it, entering the game. i love it when products make you feel, manufacturing a wholesome experience with audio and haptic feedbacks.

we did a science fair style demo for our app and a lot of people tried it. we were hopeful to demo on stage. but when they started announcing the top 10, up to the last team, my heart dropped when our team was not mentioned.

we all went into our meeting room to talk. i finished my fish congee. at this point i got sick of hackathons. all of us were. i believe we peaked at the anthropic hackathon. from now on i should focus on my research and interview prep.
