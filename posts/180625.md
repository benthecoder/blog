today is the first day of the napa trip. besides yosemite, this is the only other trip that i have with my classmates. we left around 1pm from J's house, and the first stop was domaine carnero. we had a set of 4 drinks, champagnes or red wine. i went with red wine sine champagnes are fizzy. after that we relished in the view and light, which was better than the wine in my opinoin. my fujfiilm x100s captured everyone beautifully. J also had poloroids and i have one that i plan to give to T.

for dinner we went to trader joes and each got an item to cook. i chose the salmon. i love salmon. we all cooked together, and ended up eating only at 11pm. after eating we went for the hot tub till 5am. i got to share about T and the issues with her mom. the boys helped me express and voice out the concerns in my head. we took turns asking questions with a spin the botle but in a hot tub. it didn't go very far, but we tried our best. it's one of those nights where i unlocked a new experience. and is one i never thought i would get to have. and one i hope to have more in the future.

slept at 5:30 a.m. on the couch.
