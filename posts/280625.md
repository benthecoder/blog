got my coding test with OE today and i immediately locked in. i didn't want to mess this up. this opportunity can change my life. i was freaking out at the excitement but also worried abou the at the same time it was the deadline for our final project tomorrow. so i had to balance the two. i need to learn balance. or getting OE will be a curse rather than blessing. tomorro is the deadline of our project, i know i wanted to finetune medgemma. but the problem was finding a good dataset and problem that is realistic within a day. i found this article and it became the main inspiration [fine-Tuning MedGemma on a Brain MRI Dataset](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-medgemma). the rest of the night was working on both things. and i had to sleep early for church tomorrow.
