you don't know what your [future self](https://www.ted.com/talks/shankar_vedantam_you_don_t_actually_know_what_your_future_self_wants?subtitle=en) wants

> when we make promises to someone, i.e. when we promise to love someone till death do us part, we are making promises that a stranger is going to have to keep. our future selves might not share the our views, our perspectives, our hopes.

- i foresee myself spending a lot of time at the gym and library
  - spending an hour at the gym is a good investment into my future self, even though it might steal energy away now, it will increase it in the long run, and provide mental benefits
  - the library is a like a free bookstore, it's so fun to borrow any book I want. I'm going to have a mini library at home.
