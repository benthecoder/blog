- had to actively stop myself from getting too emotional at least 5 times on the car ride to the airport
- wanted to muster the energy to read linear algebra but i would rather jump off the plane, decided to read about ML instead
- how have i never watched charlie brown before
- the butterfly effect movie is crazy
- 不会 and 不好意思到扰
- “Success is a mountain that keeps growing as you climb it”
- So many elderly chinese people on this plane, their children are most likely cracked engineers, and their grand children future tech founders and engineer
- Classic American bathrooms smell at the airport, brings me back to ISU
- Bart from SFO is at least 10 bucks to anywhere
- Most important rule is to not make eye contact with them
- And move away from them if possible
- three people smoking weed right beside us, smells like char kuey teow
- Black guy blasting drake
- Longest train ride ever in my life
- I want to go home lol why am I in SF again
- the weather is soooo nice I missed this so much
- It’s like the entire city has AC installed
- all my memories of SF slowly flooding back
- The pride month lights are still here
- Never thought i’d be dragging 58 kg worth of luggages for dear life at midnight in SF
- This motivated me to get stronger so I can handle my luggages better next time
- got directions wrong and Hazrat our uber driver saves us, mentioned that this will be a good story so its okay if things go wrong, saying we can’t be too comfortable. I wonder what Hazrat is going through
- Hotel des Arts is nicer that I imagined for 70 bucks a night
- Walking to Zzan at 12:08
- Lots of art galleries around
- There are still normal people around at this time, it’s safer that I imagined
- 20 dollar bibimbap and 6 dollar takoyaki
- got spooked by a guy on a mattress all covered in a duvet on the sidewalk
- It’s 4am and I can’t sleep, too bloated, too hungry, worried about housing, overthinking, missing home and people
- classical music on airpods with noise cancelling to block out W’a snoring for an hour didn’t work
- Stuck in transitory state, my body was frozen and numb but mind still awake
- scrolling twitter at 6 am now
- It’s already bright out
