flew southwest to miami. the flight was 3 hours. i sketched out all components i needed to put everything together. i've been flying a lot lately. one of the biggest perks working here is the amount of exposure to new things. i have never been to texas nor florida just 2 months ago. and now i live in austin, and i might even relocate to miami. things are moving fast, and i'm not sure i'm even keeping up with who i'm becoming.

me and R got to east miami and we went for sushi soon after. it was at a mall beside our hotel. the food was food truck quality, but it was a nice hangout with him. the hotel is nice. it has a balcony where you can oversee other fancy high rise apartments with a large balcony as well. miami reminds me of malaysia a lot.
