> Colossians 4:2-6 NIV
> 
> 2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. 3 And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. 4 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. 5 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 6 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.

we went to the chinese service. they were warm. we introduced ourselves during the newcomer session, and a guy came over and asked if i was interested in their fellowship.
after that we went to flower child for lunch, and walked around the domain a bit, and did work at houndstooth coffee.

i read breakneck and tried to sketch her. sketching is so hard. she taught me how to sketch a nose and lips.
then we went to nordstrom rack to find a winter jacket for her. i said columbia on amazon is better. these no name brands wouldn't last. it's always better to spend more on items like this.

we ended the day with whole foods, bought some crackers. milton's crackers are the best.

i learned about yunnan, and the poisonous mushrooms, and the beautiful snowcapped mountains.
