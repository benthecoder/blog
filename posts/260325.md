took meeting with USF professor. i shared about my interview and my professor mentioned DP is fun. learning about DP and seeing how elegant the solutions are can be fun, but thinking about how i only have 25 min to solve a DP question is highly stress-inducing. my stomach squeezes into a knot everytime it think about it. i have not solved enough questinos to have a clear thought process. my pattern matching algorithm has not seen enough data. went to capitol one cafe to do some more leetcode. got my hair cut because the edges 'have been poking on my eye. the rest of the night was more interview prep. my life has been consumed by this interview.
