we went to warren wildlife gallery. you can book a guided tour for free, which is unimaginable in california. i didn't imagine it would be super interesting but it ended up being very enjoyable. i liked how the gallery was sectioned into specific contents of the world, and the storytelling helped me appreciate the different animals and their unique quirks. also learned that the 26th us president, teddy roosevelt is the father of national parks, establishing 150 national forests, 51 bird reserves, and 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments. he is a true builder, and the best kind. i also found that my favorite animal is the arctic fox, and i also learned how giraffe skulls are very weird looking. the rest of the night we had airfried dumplings and steamed sweet potato. we also watched the f1 movie. we stayed up late again. knowing we only had each other's company for a few more days.

halfway in warren i got boomed about getting things done asap, and i was flooded with anxiety.
