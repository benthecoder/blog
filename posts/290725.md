worked out of capitol one cafe. had avocado toast (\$10) and matcha latte with soymilk (\$3).

then went back for check out and took a lime scooter to go to the national gallery of art. i was sweating profusely. the weather is like a blanket of hot air wrapped around your body.

i loved the french and dutch art and christianity art. i saw monet and van gogh and leonardo da vinci. i realized i do not like portraits that much. i took pictures of everything that piqued my interest, and they will serve as my macbook wallpaper.

after that i "limed" to the rice korean bibimbap restaurant. i like the concept of choosing ingredients for your bibimbap. i couldn't finish my meal. i didn't feel hungry for some reason. i rushed to the airspace museum. and i only had time to make a dog tag for me and T and two postcards at the gift shop. soon after i booked a ride to the airport.

on the plane i cought up on my blogs. and settled with some immigration docs for starting work tomorrow.

listened to the Tamara Winter podcast on [dialectic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rptQNq2ux90). it made me want a zine of You and Your Research by richard hamming.
