> 1 Corinthians 13: “Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. Love never fails… Now these three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.”

reading up on [Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/index.html) to write an article for Ray summit 24' interesting to learn more about distributed ML. hoping to dive deeper and understand how it works internally in their [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBw9A4j62ruI5omIJbMxly-la5w4q_TjyJgJL_jN2fI/preview#heading=h.iyrm5j2gcdoq).

hackathon at weights and biases. first hackathon with the meta boys in a team. team name is chinatown mafia. TIL there's a chinatown gang in NY called flying dragons.

also learned a hack for extending OPT from an [alumni](https://www.bassimeledath.com/). you can start an LLC and also get paid for your side projects, and stay up to a year after graduating.
