practiced a bunch of sql and python on datalemur and from questions on glassdoor. i don't feel confident about my sql. i keep getting easy queries wrong. i can tell when i'm not prepared and when i know i'm prepared, but i still feel like i can prepare more. at this point, i aim for the least embarassment possible. i'm not hoping for much, just being able to practice interviewing with a big company is a reward in and of itself. the best thing about getting interviews is it becomes a forcing function for you to practice and lock in. the worst part is you can never practice enough, and it is easy to burn out.
