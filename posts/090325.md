somehow i slept for 11 hours until 1pm and missed church. i felt worthless. i watched hillsong church's livestream to make up for it. the pastor talked about not being just an admirer of Christ but a follower. am i sitting on the sidelines, afraid to take on the responsibility as not just a christian, but a follower of Christ?
