reflection:

is there a way to avoid the iterative process of doing things, and redoing it again with new information? is that a natural part of creating something new? i wish, instead of lacking context, i could branch out topics depeer in a tree, and be able to pick the best path from there.

ive had to open chat and web based chatgpt and claude countless times today, and use cursor and claude code and code and gemini for diefferent cases at different moments. i wish there was just one big AI lab

tomorrow: improve extraction
