I had a chat with a staff DS at Meta in the Gen AI product and growth team.

It inspired me to pursue product DS, because I believe it's a good skill set to have if I'm building a startup, having product sense is useful.

### DS at Meta

- **Mission**: driving impact through data-informed decision making.
- **Misconception**: It's not just about using fancy machine learning techniques, but about leveraging data to improve products and user experiences.
- **Specialization vs. Full-Stack**: While smaller companies might require full-stack data scientists, Meta's scale allows for more specialized roles. This enables deeper expertise in specific areas of data science.

### key areas of focus

1. product
   - Use both descriptive and predictive analytics to uncover insights
   - Examples:
     - Analyzing user engagement with Meta AI
     - Determining which countries or languages to prioritize for expansion
     - Deciding on UI elements like whether to show a search bar in WhatsApp
2. ai eval
   - Goal: Create the best AI assistant possible
   - Key metrics: User acquisition, engagement (daily/monthly active users), retention
   - Evaluation methods:
     - Instruction following accuracy
     - Academic benchmarks (continuously evolving)
     - Custom evaluation metrics tailored to Meta's specific needs
3. product-market fit analysis
   - View product adoption as a funnel
   - Key metrics:
     - Adoption rate (e.g., percentage of WhatsApp users using Meta AI)
     - Retention (monthly return rate)
   - Use techniques like A/B testing and holdout tests to measure impact
4. gen ai advancements
   - Develop retrieval mechanisms for real-time knowledge supplementation

### essential skills

1. hard skills
   - Strong foundation in statistics and probability
   - Engineering mindset for building and implementing solutions
2. soft skills
   - Effective communication to convey insights and build trust
   - Product sense (especially for product scientists)
   - Analytical thinking and attention to detail
3. passion
   - Think deeply about products and user experiences, obsess over the details
