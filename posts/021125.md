![U:don](/images/021125-udon_udub.jpg)

today was our last day together in seattle. both of us were moody. we woke up later than expected, and couldn't make it to church. we watched the live stream of the sermon at the hotel lobby, and we were both dozing off. i wasn't feeling my best. 

we went to have lunch at U:Don Fresh Japanese Noodle Station. udon with tempura is probably my #2 favorite japanese food after katsu curry. we went to magus bookstore, the same one i stepped foot into in december 2023, except this time i have T by my side. we bought two c.s. lewis books. one for her one for me.

after that we went to the henry gallery, it was a free entry, and the ghost art gallery was spooky. we left soon after to get our stuff from the hotel and went to the airport.

i stood outside the security checkpoint with her, not wanting to leave. my life feels like a movie, and every day with her feels like a dream.
