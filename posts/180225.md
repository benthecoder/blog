> "For most of us, knowledge of our world comes largely through sight, yet we look about with such unseeing eyes that we are partially blind. One way to open your eyes to unnoticed beauty is to ask yourself, 'What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I would never see it again?'" – Rachel Carson

i'm working on two projects for my resume concurrently and the context switch is wearing my brain out. the first is[hn digest](https://github.com/benthecoder/hn_digest), which is about distilling deepseek r1 reasoning to finetune modernbert for hn classification. and the second is [scribesystem](https://github.com/benthecoder/scribesystem), a retro grammarly clone with cerebras.

went to ymca near campus, right after class seems to be a better time. there's a rule here that you can't use your phones at all, and that you can't rest on the machines.

discovered tempus AI, and other healthcare startups on [contrary](https://research.contrary.com/company?industry=Healthcare). it seems like health care might be my best route right now. i'm starting to worry about getting a job, but i'm still having fun building. i'd rather get stuck in errors than do a leetcode question.

sore throat came out of nowhere around 8 p.m., might be acid reflux from gym, or not drinking enough water the day before. coding on my windows laptop and on my macbook at the same time. tired.
