One of my life goals is to get into [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

I love building things and I want to experience the life of being a founder, and making something that people want, even though it's like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death, I still want to do it.

Here's some [takeaways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_QN00pr4O0) from a founder who recently went through the interview.

- Interview selection rate is 7%, and only 3-4% make it to the batch
- When you apply for YC, they ask you about your idea, team, fund raising, but also **other startup ideas**
- Interviews are one question, and one quick answer, and move on
  - Example mock questions on this [website](https://jamescun.github.io/iPG/)
- Try to be formidable, but don't be too defensive
  - you need to have conviction, complete confidence in your idea
  - you have to be open and willing to hear feedback, they have a good reason for disagreeing with you, and you should listen
- They'll challenge you on PMF and scale
  - Can you grow into the next billion dollar company, the next **unicorn**?
- not every business is venture scalable / needs capital, if you have an idea, just go build it
- Many YC founders are not first time applicants, they want you to keep trying, show your passion
- The YC office wifi password is "makesomething"
- They might not invest in your current idea, but your team and your execution
