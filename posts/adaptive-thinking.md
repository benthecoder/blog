[Adaptive thinking](https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/adaptive-thinking/) is the ability to recognize unexpected and complex situations, quickly consider various possible responses, and decide on the best one.

If critical thinking is the ability to be exceptionally rational, adaptive thinking is the same ability to be logical, but doing it at high speed.

Imagine an experienced surgeon who's done thousands of surgeries. If something unexpected happens, smartness won't do any good. They'll have to quickly switch gears and make the right decision to save a life.

That's the advantage of adaptive thinking, you can apply what you know quickly in an unexpected situation.

### Examples

A great example is Top Gun school. The program was focused on failing and learning from failures. They trained fighter pilots to learn how to act fast in dangerous environments with many unknowns. They learned how to best respond to different scenarios.

A more down-to-earth example is as a founder, you'll face many situations where you don't have the answers to. It's not in the playbook. And you have to think quick on your feet. You'll need adaptive thinking or your emotions will consume you. Like a chess board, you consider all the possible options and see which one will result in a checkmate.

So how does one develop adaptive thinking?

The biggest blocker is not letting your mind wander. You need the ability to explore the unknown unknowns. This gives you options. When you have options, you can find the best response to unpredictable situations.

### 3 components

There are 3 components to master adaptive thinking:

1. **Detailed planning**
   - plan in advance how you envision a task. Think about every little detail.
   - Sit down and write everything you need for your task to be successful.
2. **Negative visualization**
   - the best form of planning is having a plan if things fail
   - preparing for things that can go wrong reduces the chance of failure, and increase teh chances of survival
3. **Staying calm under pressure**
   - things will inevitably go wrong, calmness is your best friend
   - avoid emotional hijacking: emotions block your ability to think clearly.

Now you know the ingredients for adaptive thinking, how do you actually improve on it?

### Solve problems

In Top Gun school, every training session is recorded. This gives them a library of case studies.

They can discuss the situation and answer: What happened? Why? Why your response was good? Why it was bad? How it can be better? What we can do to prevent similar mistakes in the future?

An engineer with 20 years of experience has a whole catalog of problems (and solutions) he can retrieve from to when something unexpected happens.

So, put yourself in situations where you encounter real problems and think about different ways to solve them.

This helps you expand your library of problems.

Life is filled with unexpected situations.

You should be **comfortable with uncomfortable situations** and adopt the idea that <mark>you will never be fully prepared</mark>

There will always be something you don't know how to do. But this should never discourage you from moving forward.
