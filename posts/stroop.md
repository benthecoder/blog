> In psychology, the Stroop effect is the delay in reaction time between congruent and incongruent stimuli.

It is my turn to play the piano for the church worship session this Sunday.

Today was the practice session, and in one of the songs, the lead singer requested a key change.

It was just a key change down one step, from C to B-flat, so I could still manage.

I was looking at every chord in the old key on my printed sheet music, and then translating it to the new key in real time. But at some point my visual stimuli of seeing the C chord would win over, and cause me to hit the wrong chords.

I thought about why that happened and realized I was experiencing the [stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#In_popular_culture).

You've probably experienced this effect yourself in brain teasers.

Known as the Stroop test, you're given a list of words that are printed in a different color than the meaning of the word. And your task is to name the color of the word, not the word itself, as fast as you can.

For example, when presented with the word "[Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlot0i3Zykw)", it's easier to say red, as opposed to the color of the text (blue).

There are some [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Theories) used to explain why this effect happenes.

They're all based on the idea that our brains processes relevant and irrelevant information in parallel, but they both "race" to your brain's central processor to be chosen as a response.

This neuropsychological test has different [variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect?useskin=vector#Variations), and can reveal a lot about your brain and how it processes information.

Among the most important uses is in measuring a person's [selective attention](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27437-001) capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.

It can also diagnose different psychiatric and neurological disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression.

What I find most interesting is that studying this effect might help us better understand the black box that is our brain, which can allow us to overcome our fast instinctual thinking, known as System 1 in the book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow?useskin=vector), helping us reach to more logical conclusions.
