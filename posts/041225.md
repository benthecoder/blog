for the past four months i've been living here i would complain to myself (and others) about the fact that there was no good, authentic asian food here. hainanese chicken was something i kept craving and would get when i got the chance to go back to sf. but today i was on doordash, and somehow stumbled upon it. i swear i searched for chicken rice on this app before and nothing came up. it was just fried chicken, or asian fried rice.

i ordered it from lee's kitchen, making sure to have zero expectations at all, and it was surprisingly good. they had the ginger scallion sauce, but the chili wasn't the right one. i take back what i said about austin. i think i just never got the chance to explore the city at all.
