I'm spending new year's eve in Denver, CO with my family. My graduation trip has been a lot of fun.

Road-tripping with a Kia Outlander, having Mt Rushmore all to ourselves cause it's winter, watching bisons cross the road right in front of us in Yellowstone, experiencing breathtaking sunsets on canyons and salt lakes, relishing the snowcapped mountains, spending Christmas in Seattle, seeing the great wave art in person, living in cabins and RVs, modern apartments, entire houses, and hotels, and entering myriads of antique malls, thrift stores, and bookstore throughout the trip, long hours driving listening to the Huberman lab podcast and chinese songs. I'm grateful I get to see all these places.

It's time to review my 2023.

I've written some reflections on my life in my [birthday](http://bneo.xyz/posts/22) post and my [graduation](http://bneo.xyz/posts/isu) post, now it's time to answer some reflective questions, and look forward to 2024.

In an ideal world, I would be moving to the bay, maybe back with Tesla, dealing with housing, OPT documents, work contracts, getting a car and paying for car insurance, meeting up with my friends on the weekends, going to more events and hackathons, and live the life I wanted every since I started at INTI in 2019.

But life is never the way we plan, and there are things we cannot escape from, events out of our control.

However, I'm doing grad school, so I have another shot at this.

I had a hiatus back in 2020 when COVID hit, and it was 6 months of reading, learning, and exercising. So 2024 seems familiar to me, I'm going to have another gap break before my graduate school starts in Fall 24', but with more intention, bigger goals, and greater purpose.

My main goal is to fix the many issues of my body, dive into research and find the root cause, and get surgery to end the 3 years of suffering. I was stuck in the US, unable to get proper health care and support, so coming back was necessary.

If my health permits, I'm also going to explore my wide array of interests, and commit to learning, and more importantly, **building** everyday. Habits are essential to learning, so I aim to pick up some daily habits for coding and reading, like how I'm doing in this blog.

To really reflect upon, and look forward to the new year, I've answered a list of questions from Twitter.

    - filled with memorable experiences, lots of traveling, new friendships, lots of health hardships and having to fight it alone, psychological and physical pain
11. Which aspect was most challenging/most easeful?
    - managing GERD and other health issues, it prevents me from exercising and eating well, and impacts my energy levels throughout the day. It’s hard to be productive without good health.

    - I invested a lot of time into curating and diving into rabbit holes, i would like to invest more in building and creating, than consuming.

> And don't spend any time during the year on activities that don't point you in that direction.
