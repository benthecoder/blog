it took me an entire day just to refine plots for my presentation. i was drilling into every detail, the size of the axis, the labels, the color of the bars, the size of the bars, the alignment and spacing. LLMs are terrible at making nice plots on their first try. perhaps i was just missing the right prompts.

i've been telling everyone i'm planning to do a PhD. and i'm starting to wonder if i truly know the weight of those words, and the responsiblity and stress that might come with actually commiting to it. i do enjoy research, and i love consuming info, and acting on it. but i'm also wondering if there are alternative options, not for comfort or sense of safety and security, but the ones that maximizes agency. how do i know if i'm on the right path unless i start on it? and when is it too late to figure it out?

made a weekly review list of 10 questions, inspired by [b.k.](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/)

1. what were my top 3 accomplishments this week?
2. what did i read?
3. what distracted me?
4. how was my sleep? health?
5. what am i grateful for this week?
6. what challenge did i overcome?
7. what did i learn this week?
8. what surprised me?
9. what brought me joy?
10. am i progressing towards my long-term goals?
