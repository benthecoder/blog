What is the difference between smart and wise people?

One of the virtues of wise people is they have courage to act on their knowledge, but the humility to doubt what they know.

One of the best description of how wise people act comes from [Bob Johansen](https://www.iftf.org/people/bob-johansen/), who advices people, when dealing with an uncertain future and still move forward, to have "<mark>strong opinions, which are weakly held</mark>".

If people have weak opinions, they won't put effort into testing them or develop with the strongest arguments for them.

However, just as important, do not be too attached to your beliefs, otherwise, it undermines your ability to "see" and "hear" evidence that clashes with your opinion. This is [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias?useskin=vector).
