visited socratica in sf for the first time, such a cool and surreal experience. said hi to some twitter friends, demo'd in front of everyone which was super scary but rewarding. got friend chicken at k soul, went to main campus for the first time, inspired to write a paper for asia pacific fellowship, probably something ai for climate change or nlp for dialects in china. st ignacious church is beautiful, lone mountain view at the top is on my bucket list. had a catch up with a friend while i drank oolong and he ate matcha rolled ice cream talking about relationships.

this weekend felt so long. so fulfilling. if my weekdays weren't filled with classes, life in sf would be so full of excitement and energy. i feel like i achieved a lot of quests that i wanted since coming to sf. now its time to lock in and go heads down on classes and work.
