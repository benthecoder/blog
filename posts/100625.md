today was my doctors appointment. the actual reason why i came back. left at 9am, S drove my mom and i. i was schedueld for 10:30a.m. but i had to wait for 2 hours. the doctor responsible for my test was not aware of the purpose of my test, or my background or medical history. that was odd to experience. i had to explain what i was there for. malaysia needs to be better at this. i went to one of the best (most expensive) hospital in KL.

i saw my surgeon at 2pm. he tells me everything is fine and i don't have to worry about the wrap and i have decades. i felt skeptical. wouldn't the person who treated you want to say that for their own benefit? i asked about gym and they said i am one of the rare people who feel my surgery and thus can feel discomfort while doing workouts, but also said i can do whatever and it wouldn't affect the wrap. i brought up antidepressants and he was very willing to prescribe me some. i don't know how i feel about his assurance. i need to see a new doctor.

we went to my town shopping mall. we watched karate kid legends. i liked this movie, it portrays how it feels to move into a new place and having to adapt and find your place, and also touches on trauma and having your past creep up into the present, and having friends and family help you navigate and get through it.

we had dimsum for dinner. i learned that i love the fried taro balls.
