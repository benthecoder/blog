Breaking Bad actor Bryan Cranston went on a journey of self-discovery when he was 20 on his motorcycle with his brother.

He left California with 150 bucks in his pocket,
and had total freedom to go anywhere, do anything.

He worked different jobs along the way, and explored different places, slept on anywhere he could lay his sleeping bag.

After two years, he decided he wanted to become an actor.

He allowed himself to be lost, so that he could be found.

His [advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg0uCvnHg74) is to be lost, to be a wanderer, a [fl√¢neur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur?useskin=vector#Other_uses).

Being lost is a good thing.

We get so tied up with being productive and achieving "success" that we don't even stop and ask whether we're pursuing what we really want in life.

It's so easy to work on something we believe is meaningful to us, until one day we realize we've been living someone else's life.

As Sam Altman [said](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short), The days are long but the decades are short.

So, embrace the unknown, wander, and allow yourself to get lost.

Don't be afraid of not knowing where you are or where you're going.

As long as you have your sense of direction, you'll figure it out.
