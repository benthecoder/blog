on my way to the office on the waymo, i saw a [Jaguar XK8 convertible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XK_(X100)) on the street. convertibles are so cool. 

it reminded me of the second generation (NB) Mazda Miata MX-5, where Miata derives from Old High German for "reward". it was produced at Mazda's hiroshima plant, and created under design credo [Jinba ittai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinba_ittai), meaning "unity of horse and rider". the lotus cars served as a design benchmark, and they're described as a successor to the 50s and 60s italian and british roadsters.

went to local foods beside the office. got a matcha latte (hot, sub oat milk, add vital proteins (1 scoop), add ashwagandha (1 scoop)) and a tuna bowl (SOS, add rice/quinoa blend) to work.

came across a figure by swyx, which states "your coding ability is constrained by your codebase understanding"
