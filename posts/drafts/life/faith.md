I was baptized as a baby and grew up in a Christian household and went to church every Sunday.

As a kid, church felt like school to me.

At Sunday school, we would do arts and craft, watching bible videos, learn about the bible. I would play around with other kids at church.

I would also perform as served in the children ministry. One time I acted as Isaac in a bible skit, I was to be offered as a sacrifice to God by Abraham.

Near the end of high school and starting college, church felt lonely.

My dad became the chairman of a new church, and our family left our home church that I grew up in to help build a new one.

At that time, I felt alone. I was in a new church for a few years where there wasn't anyone else my age.

I joined the Christian Fellowship club got to learn about the bible with them.

I also participated in an evangelism class and learned a lot about how Christianity compares with different religions and the [Bridge diagram](https://bible.org/seriespage/3-bridge) tool used to explain salvation. We broke into groups of two by the end and went around campus to share the gospel. It was an interesting experience.
