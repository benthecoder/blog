> Anxiety is the price of the ticket to life: intrapsychic depression is the by-product of the refusal to climb aboard." - James Hollis

I always saw anxiety as a bug in my software, a weakness that needs to be fixed, a disability that makes me cripple in the face of the unknown.

But [Søren Kierkegaard](https://academyofideas.com/2018/02/soren-kierkegaard-psychology-anxiety/) shines a different light on anxiety.

First, we need to understand the contrast between fear and anxiety.

Fear is typically triggered by a threat that we can pinpoint. It's a known threat that sharpens our senses, and makes us go into flight or flight mode.

Anxiety, however, is feeling threatened yet not knowing where or what the danger is. It paralyzes our senses and inhibits action. It “attacks us from all sides at once”.

In [The Concept of Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concept_of_Anxiety), Kierkegaard suggests that "existential anxiety" - the common form of anxiety we feel in our daily lives - is what it means to be human, to be self-conscious.

Kierkegaard angst, existential anxiety

As Kierkegaard puts it: Anxiety is "the dizziness of freedom".

No way to truly make the right decisions

To actualize who we really are and could be, we must not succumb to the inaction of anxiety. The development of self is dependent on the ability to face up to the anxiety of existence and move with and through it.

solution: passion

In order to best make use of anxiety and live well with it, individuals must pursue what they would refer to as passion. This could take the form of things like a love, a creative endeavor, a family, personal growth, a career, an ideology, or a belief. What's important is that one orients their passions based on subjective truth.

avoiding inaction through conformity

Individuals attempt to avoid the anxiety and responsibility of their existence by universally conforming to the status quo. One attempts to absolve themselves from the responsibility of their choices by means of things like substance abuse chasing social status superficial action materialism.

consequence of succumbing to anxiety

The consequences of succumbing to anxiety and inaction for Kierkegaard is much worse. It results in despair, a depressed apathetic state, a failed lost and unrealized self, a frictional experience of existence.

embrace it

Anxiety is arguably a fundamental ingredient entrenched in the experience of human consciousness. To feel and to think is to be anxious. We must try our best to learn how to live with and through it, keep moving forward into the unknown, and take our leaps of faith into what we truly and personally believe makes it all worth living.
