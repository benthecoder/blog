I measure my days by articles written, projects completed, TODOs done, books or blog posts read, hours of work done, lines of code written, podcasts/YT videos watched, and many more that are all quantitative.

Most days I get very little done, and I feel like a failure.

But there are other units of measurements to consider that are not just dollars earned or tasks completed â€“ measurements that call for a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

- laughter
- time spent in nature
- no. of steps walked
- creative expressions (art, music, writing)
- quality of sleep
- acts of kindness
- quality conversations
- meeting new people
- being bored
- gratitude

which units of measurement serves you best at this moment?

what can you do today to maximize these?
