i played for mont kiara church today. and talked to a few church members. i played the amen song terribly. my memory did not serve me well.

kept thinking about building the still app, a prayer reminder [app](https://chatgpt.com/share/684598a1-c1c0-8000-8938-ab3ac5b37f3d).

got home and grinded out on arabesque on the piano the rest of the day and worked out on the stationary bicycle.

watched drug development with AI [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpIMuCeEtSk&t=1303s) from (https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model/ while working out. protein structures are like 3d jigsaw puzzles, so making drugs are like making the right lego pieces that fit for molecules. but it was surprising to hear that there is a 90% failure rate for drug development, only 1 in 20 medicinal chemist have their drugs work in clinical trials.
