![The Pond, Lowry, 1950](/images/thepond.jpeg)

went to the library for research grind. took photos around the chinese new year market. photgraphy is so essential to my life. i'm unable to go through life without capturing the world. it's irresistable.

1. [On the pleasure of reading private notebooks](https://wastebook.substack.com/p/on-the-pleasure-of-reading-private)
   - when people say what they actually think, conversations become more interesting, because people's genuine thoughts are more detailed and alive than the simulations they have of what they "should" say
   - reading notebooks make you feel less alone than (most) published works, you're reading what happened, in real time, inside another human.
   - ex: Pascal's x, Lichtenberg's waste books, Simon Weil's private essays, Kafka's Diary, the first half of Brian Eno's diary

5. [how to begin](https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-begin)
   - take something you like and try to copy it exactly. copying teaches you a lot about technique and taste
   - how to copy in writing (deep copying)
     - understand the specific moves a writer is making (take apart an essay and make pedantic and precise observations i.e. how many paragraphs, how many sentences each, opening with a quote, thej context behind the quote, etc.)
     - replicate the techniques and structure in your own work (i.e. the writer ends their essay with a rhetorical question, and opens up the next section with a quote that answers part of the question)
6. [Life Lessons from the First Half-Century of My Career](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/life-lessons-from-the-first-half-century-of-my-career/)
   - people-focused: family first! choose happiness. seek out honest feedback. courage is not the absence of fear, but triumph over it. cost of praise is small, value to others is inestimable
   - career-focused: most of us spend too much time on what is urgent, and not enough time on what is important. lead by example. nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished withouth passion.
7. [A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets](https://knowingmachines.org/critical-field-guide)
   - Part of the [Knowing Machines](https://knowingmachines.org) research project, an indispensable doc in this age and time where companies are scraping data everywhere to train the best model.
   - key points:
     - 1\) investigate how dataset was collected, annotated, and processed. ensure it aligns with your research goals. be aware of potential biases
     - 2\) ensure informed consent from data subjects and protect their privacy
     - 3\) collaborate with healthcare professionals, pateints, and stakeholders to ensure your research addresses real-world needs
     - 4\) create detailed documentation, include origins, transformations, and limitations
8. [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
   - three core principles of implementing agents
     - maintain **simplicity** in your agent's design
     - prioritize **transparency** by explicitly showing teh agent's planning steps
     - carefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool **documentation and testing**
9. [Good Slides Reduce Complexity](https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/good-slides-reduce-complexity)
   - every slide should say ONE thing
     - decide on the single point of the presentation, and everything should be oriented around that key point
   - make the slide titles tell a story ([5-slide pitch](https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/presenting-to-the-ceo-in-5-slides))
   - use visuals to explain, not decorate
   - don't be afraid to break the rules
10. [How to Build a Truly Useful AI Product](https://every.to/thesis/how-to-build-a-truly-useful-ai-product?curius=1573)
    - don't solve problems that next-gen models will handle automatically
    - high per-user cost use of SOTA models actually benefit startups (sell a premium experience for users)
    - no matter how good models get, the context you give them will always matter (ex: Granola, context-dependent note app for meetings)
    - go really narrow, pick a very specific use case and become exceptional at it.
    - "How does this product make me feel when I use it?"
