i learned that meetings really drain me. had 4 meetings today and napped twice. in retrospect, it could also be the early stages of getting sick. (i'm writing this 3 days later)

i remember waking up from my nap, and i was just staring at the ceiling in the dark on my bed. thinking to myself about how i'm in sf, the city i dreamt of living in, and yet i'm still stuck in my room like i was in iowa. i was disappointed at myself.

i spent the entire day gathering papers and clearing the leftover cache from meetings, and i couldn't stop searching papers, to the point where i was searching in bed on my phone, at 1 a.m. i feel like this is OCD.

neck tension and headaches caused insomnia, my music kept playing over and over, and i kept twisting and turning on my bed. it was not a pleasant night.
