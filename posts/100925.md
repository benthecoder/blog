i was granted the good fortune of staying home to spend more time with T. we went to P terry's to have their burgers. we were going to go for shake shack since the weather was burning hot, but we had to do the austin tourist thing. the burger was dry and i needed their unsweetened ice tea to make it go down easier. then we went to pavement to thrift for a dress. T tried a few and found an H&M black dress that she looked amazing in. then we walked to tjs to buy salmon and other kiwi, and we made miso soup and salmon for dinner. it's nice to spend a day out like this like normal human beings, instead of being cooped up in an office or at home. i would enjoy this life a lot, it doesn't take a lot to be happy.
