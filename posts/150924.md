> Hebrews 10:24 (NIV) And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,

first time attending a church that speaks cantonese. very interesting experience going to a church alone without knowing anyone. but still felt the warmth of a small community where everyone knows each other.

walked through the mooncake festival stalls. they were selling so many things. face masks, 10 dollar sweaters, expensive mushrooms, poppers, chesnuts, popcorn, bamboo, plants, and of course, moon cakes

had the worst headache right after church. drank lots of water. napped. woke up. watched lucas sin review claypot in HK on youtube. napped more. so much pressure in my head. feels like my brain is being squeezed. feeling very thirsty all the time. drinking more water.

the three of us were grinding at A's studio. mock interviewing. using claude to generate questions. playing the guessing game. realizing more and more gaps in our understanding. felt really sick and heaty.

had dinner at yee's restaurant, the famous braised beef stew and seafood claypot. get free soup as a group. stay longer for free watermelon.

what will be in this 20 minutes? so much uncertainty?

headache came back and i passed out at 10 p.m.
