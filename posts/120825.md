> I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it. We must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capable of resuscitating the body and the soul.

meals:

- breakfast: salmon+rice+spinach (10am)
- lunch: chicken teriyaki (4pm)
- dinner: chicken+dumplings (10pm)

notes:

- spent the day vibecoding, finally get to work on the front end
- claude opus 4.1 great at front end, and gpt 5 is great at backend
- demo at all hands tomorrow feeling excited and anxious

reflection:

- can't seem to stop working the entire week, it's affecting my sleep quality, i can't shut my brain off
- am i even learning anything that is transferrable? i should spent more time talking to people than just trying to build something, because what will last longer is the relationships i build here, and not some feature i got to perfect and launch, which will ultimately be deprecated and replaced in a few months.

tomorrow: demo time

slept: 1:10 a.m.
