spent the morning dealing with precommit shenanigans. i had issues because i wanted to edit the precommit, but i have to commit that precommit file but i didn't want to do that. basically there's an invoke in the command which isn't reading from my poetry env so it doesn't understand what is invoke it reads from usr/bin. in the end i gave up dealing with that, so now i habitually do invoke lint --fix before i commit. which isn't the end of the world
