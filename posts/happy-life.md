> “Life is made of moments, small pieces of silver amidst long stretches of tedium. It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as busy as the ones most of us lead now, that won’t happen. We have to teach ourselves now to live, really live . . . to love the journey, not the destination.” - Anna Quindlen

[A Short Guide to a Happy Life](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/100286) is short book with life lessons accompanied by lovely pictures.

My main takeaway is to not waste your days just existing, but to truly live by appreciating the little moments. To learn how to love the journey, but not the destination. To not take life for granted, but treat life like a terminal illness, a great gift, and then we'll start living life like we ought to live it.

Lessons and advice from the book

- "Don't ever confuse the two, your life and your work"
- "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."
- “Show up. Listen. Try to laugh.”
- “You cannot be really good at your work if your work is all you are.”
- “Turn off your cell phone. Keep still. Be present.”
- “Get a life in which you are generous.”
- “All of us want to do well, but if we do not **do good** too then doing well will never be enough.”
- “Knowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God gives us.” It is so easy to exist rather than to live… Unless you know a clock is ticking.
- “Think of life as a terminal illness.”
