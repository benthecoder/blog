meals:

- breakfast: oats
- lunch: banana + tacodeli (chicken mushroom taco + chips)
- dinner: kbop bulgogi beef

notes:

- toured spaces, firmspace and industrious
  - spaces charged for coffee and was claustrophobic, biggest gym
  - firmspace is very corporate and uptight, 40% lawyers,
  - industrious
- reviewed my first PR today
- learned what django models + apps and makemigrations and migrate
- always use dbeaver first
- CHECK staging and PROD HOSTs
- grateful for friends and living close to them.
- excited about getting this project out for demo

reflection:

- its hard to dive into a new framework and codebase, its super helpful to have R guide me through it
- i've been getting home and going in a cycle of shopping while working till past midnight. on one hand i'm obsessed with buiding this because i enjoy learning and working on something meaningful, but i can't stop
- i should pay more attention to taking breaks
- i need to be GRATEFUL for having the opportunity to join an AMAZING startup with COOL and EXCITING work to do every day. and living in a nice apartment and having the chance to design and decorate it. STOP the mindset of "i have to" and switch it to "i get to".

tomorrow: getting query to work + continue to design my apartment

slept: 1:35 a.m.
