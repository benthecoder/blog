Paul Graham wrote about how to do [great work](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), and he distilled the recipe below in his recent article "[superlinear](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html)":

- Choose work you have a natural [_aptitude_](http://paulgraham.com/smart.html) for and a deep [_interest_](http://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html) in.
- Develop a habit of [building](http://www.paulgraham.com/ace.html) your own [projects](http://www.paulgraham.com/own.html); it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious.
- Work as [hard](http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html) as you can **without burning out**, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge.
- These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. **Notice and explore such gaps**, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole [new field](http://www.paulgraham.com/newideas.html).
- **Take as much risk as you can afford**; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative.
- Seek out the [best](http://www.paulgraham.com/5founders.html) colleagues.
- Develop [good taste](http://www.paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html) and learn from the best examples.
- Be honest, especially with yourself.
- Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs.
- When in doubt, follow your [_curiosity_](https://x.com/paulg/status/1706612595426201795?s=20). It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.
