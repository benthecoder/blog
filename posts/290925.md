till this day, after 2 months into the company, i still have trouble at standup, where i have to effectively condense my work in a way that isn't too detailed, but still showcase that i have done the work, and i know what i'm doing, and i have clear next steps. i often make the mistakes of blurting out a specific issue i'm facing. i have to remember to be positive and brief. works great in any conversation as well.
