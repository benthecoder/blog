went to valencia st to cowork with adrian. we went to ritual coffee. a fair warning to those who decides to work out of this cafe, there is no wifi.

i came here with the purpose of buying SF coffee for T's parents. i took pictures of all the coffee and chocolate and sent it to her. to make sure my gift aligns with their taste profiles.

later this day, J came with W to discuss about the offer. the negotiation happened in person. it's tough to navigate around money talk.

after that we went to dog eared books for a postcard for the parents. and j gave us a ride home. i talked about how i wanted to start as soon as possible to start getting paid. but i had a feeling i just wanted the money and assurance more than anything.
