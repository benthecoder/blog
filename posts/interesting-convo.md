> When seated at a table with people you don't know, ask "what are you interested in?" or "what have you been thinking about lately?" instead of "what do you do?" – [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/more-interesting-dinner-conversations)

When I meet another fellow college student, and I try to have a conversation with them. My go-to question is "What's your major?"

But I think asking that question is like running gradient descent with a small learning rate, it takes a couple more questions (iterations) to really get to know that person or to get them talking (converge to global minimum).

I think asking "What are you interested in?", you immediately get a peek into the person's life, what they spend most of their time doing and what they're passionate about.

I recently got asked what my life philosophy was, and I think that's a good question to ask. It did threw me off a bit, and made me think whether it's different from my values / principles. My answer was something along the lines of "I want to create value, build something that provides value for humanity. I like coding and building stuff."

Another question is I want to start asking is "What makes you happy?" I think happiness is something a lot of people seek, and you can tell a lot about a person from their answer.
