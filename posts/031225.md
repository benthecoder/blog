this was my top song for 2025. i'm not sure how, maybe i had it on loop one day, or multiple days. it's only 1 minute and 18 seconds, and it's the second to last song of the wind rises soundtrack. it conjures bittersweet emotions, and it ends on an unfinished note, which i interpret as although this chapter ended, the best is yet to come and the story is not over yet. even though that's not the case in the anime, it gives me hope. the entire album is amazing, as is the case for most ghibli soundtracks.

we're back to being long distance. and even though it sucks being apart, it does help us go further in our relationship in the long term. long distance helps mold us into strong individuals who are self-sustaining, and makes us stronger when we are together. we cope by making stickers and enjoying each other's virtual presence.
