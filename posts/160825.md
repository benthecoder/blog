> What does good system design look like? I’ve written before that it looks underwhelming. In practice, it looks like nothing going wrong for a long time. You can tell that you’re in the presence of good design if you have thoughts like “huh, this ended up being easier than I expected”, or “I never have to think about this part of the system, it’s fine”. Paradoxically, good design is self-effacing: bad design is often more impressive than good. I’m always suspicious of impressive-looking systems

reflection:

i keep eating lunch at 4pm lately, and i keep sleeping past 2 a.m. seems like i'm still living on SF time. took the time to sketch out the db design, and the columns and tables i need. i don't like how messy 6th and congress ave is.

tomorrow: FINISH MY RESEARCH PAPER

slept: 2:30 a.m.
