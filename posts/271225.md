the destination was dallas. we intentionally passed by the welcome to oklahoma sign on the way, since my mom had never been to oklahoma and wanted to check that off.

after a long drive, we rewarded ourselves with good korean food. i found a seolleongtang place in carrollton. we were the only people there when we arrived, and stayed till it closed. seolleongtang is a milky beef bone broth soup—it's intentionally bland and requires you to season it with salt and pepper yourself. my parents kept saying it had no taste, which was funny.

we went back to the apartment and i watched coraline. there's so much i don't remember about the movie. this might be my first time watching it in full.
