this morning was my first time playing for two services. i had to play 8 songs in total. it took a toll on me. but i kept reminding myself that i'm not playing for the people but for God, and to enjoy the process rather than the result. i took photos around chinatown with my sony cybershot. i love this little thing that i can easily carry around and shoot stuff. i just wish the sensors were faster and images won't be that blurry without stabilization. but perhaps that's a feature rather than a bug. the rest of the day was taken up by the last project and assignment ever, possibly in my life (if phd is not in the horizon).
