today was the last day we were in sf. i saw a new soba restaurant that had its soft opening just a week ago on instagram. and for all the effects instagram and shorts has on our brains, i love how it exposes me to news like this.

i had the highest expectations for this restaurant. it felt very japanese. all the servers were japanese, and they hit the gong when we entered and the waiters and workers all murmured irasshaimase, which means welcome.

we browsed around forest books, kinokuniya, and got matcha at matcha cafe maiko.

we went to delta air gates, a new area of sf terminal i had never entered before. i bought a tuna sandwich and T got a wrap. we said goodbye once more. i watched up on the plane.
austin was foggy this time. and this time i'm not returning home to an empty house. my parents are there. i'm glad they're there.
