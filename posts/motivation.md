Some notes on how to [set and achieve goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrtR12PBKb0) by Andrew Huberman.

- define goals
  - **Specificity and measurability** are key components of successful goal setting
    - Include specific actions with **verbs**
    - Specify amount of time per session, how frequent
  - have metrics for quantifiable goals, have process and specific actions for non quantifiable ones
  - writing down goals on **paper** engages neural circuitry effectively
  - set **one priority goal** instead of multiple
  - choose a goal that feels **slightly out of reach** to recruit necessary neural circuits associated with arousal
- Pursuing
  - Update visual reminders daily to reinforce goals, our visual system adapts to regular stimuli
  - **keep your goals private** (diminishing returns) or share them with people who doubt you (for added motivation)
  - Focus on a 12-week cycle/quarterly for pursuing goals
    - quantify number of hours per week and day for goal
    - choose specific days of week
- Visualization of End
  - When highly motivated, spend 1 minute visualizing positive outcome is helpful
  - If unmotivated, spend 1 minute visualizing failure and how it will feel
  - Ask yourself about motivation level each day before starting work. Quantify on a scale if desired
- Visual focus
  - Narrowing **visual attention** on a specific target increases **alertness and arousal**.
    - recruits neurochemicals that increase focus, motivation, and perceived effort
    - maintain focus on target for at least 30 secs, up to 90.
- To maintain motivation
  - take short breaks every 20 min or on the hour
  - engage in panoramic vision by looking at horizon or corners of rooms help relax tired eyes and improve focus
  - breathing properly and staying visually focused
  - random intermittent reinforcement (i.e. in casinos), rewarding oneself randomly for completing milestones, enhances motivation
- Dopamine <-> motivation
  - dopamine is molecule of motivation
  - rewarding oneself after each milestone diminishes reward potency
  - Viewing accomplishment as the only reward undermines success probability
  - You need to randomly reward yourself
- middle problem
  - motivation decrease during middle phase of goal pursuit
  - break middle section into smaller chunks
  - use tools like visual target to increase focus
- Motivation throughout the day (circadian rhythm)
  - Most people experience their highest level of attention and motivation 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking up.
  - time block and engage in goal pursuit and don't worry about specific timings
