His aesthetics [influenced](https://onlyonceshop.com/collection/braun) Apple designer [Jonathan Ive](https://designmuseum.org/designers/jonathan-ive) and many Apple products pay tribute to his [work](https://www.braunhousehold.com/en-us/braun-100-years) for [Braun](https://onlyonceshop.com/collection/braun).

1. is **innovative** – technological development is always offering new opportunities for original designs
2. makes a product **useful** – products are bought to be used. It satisfies the criteria of not just function, but psychological and aesthetic
3. is **aesthetic** – aesthetic is integral to its usefulness, products have an effect on people's well-being.
4. makes a product **understandable** – it can make the product talk, at best, it is self-explanatory
5. is **unobstrusive** – should be neutral and restrained, leaving room for the user's self expression
6. is **honest** – does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable that it really is
7. is **long-lasting** – avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated
8. is **thorough** down to the last detail – care and accuracy shows respect towards consumer
9. is **environmentally friendly** – conserves resources, minimizes physical and visual pollution
10. is as **little design** as possible – less, but better, concentrates on the essential aspects
