![chinese evergreen](/images/181125-chinese-evergreen.jpg)

woke up too late and missed my PT appointment. turns out i missed 3 appointments, even though i explicitly mentioned to a trainer there that i wouldn't be able to make it since i'm in a different state. nonetheless the person said they forgot about it and all my appointments were deleted. i'll just do the exercises at home at this point. the appointments were mostly for motivation to get out of the house and actually set time to do those exercises.

also did some cleanup and organization. my chinese evergreen (aglaonema) has been infected by mealy bugs. every time i come home from a trip i would see those little white devils huddling together on my plant, and i would wipe them off each time. i got sick of it and decided it was time for it to go. i wrapped it up with tape, and disposed of it in the trash. probably not the best way for it to go. but i couldn't think of any other options living in an apartment complex.
