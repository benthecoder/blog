we went midvalley with my sister. i watched the thunderbolts movie with my mom. this one was an a marvels version of suicide squad. it was big on mental health, where they talk about the emptiness was quite overused, and when they started turning people into black shadows and everything was being engulfed, it looked a bit silly but it could have been worse. it was inception like when they travelled through different rooms and memories.

bought a new frying pan and pot and knife from isetan. auntie B gave us her experience and recomendations.

we also got an antler luggage that cost RM 900.

im blessed with a family and with essentials that will help me thrive and survive in the US. i have nothing to complain about.
