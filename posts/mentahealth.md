1. Sleep
   - Get 6-8 hours of quality sleep per night
   - Maintain consistent bedtime and wake up schedule (+/- 1 hour)
2. Sunlight
   - Get 10-30 min of morning [sunlight](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00135-8), even on overcast days
   - Sit near sunlight or invest in bright light therapy lamp (~10,000 lux)
   - Getting sunlight throughout day ideal for mood

3. Exercise
   - Get 180-220 min/week of cardio in zone 2 heart rate
   - Incorporate resistance/strength training
   - Daily movement also beneficial
4. Nutrition
   - Focus on quality, minimally processed whole foods
   - Emphasize foods high in vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber
5. Social Connections
   - Invest time in positive relationships
   - Limit physical/screen-based isolation
   - Reflect on which relationships are draining vs. energizing
6. Stress Management
   - Use tools like cold exposure, deep breathing, meditation
   - Physiological sigh - inhale deep, inhale again, long exhale
   - Deliberate cold exposure elevates adrenaline / noradrenaline
