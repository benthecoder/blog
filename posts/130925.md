we went to the domain today to shop for dresses. we went into aritzia, free people, reformation. coming from uniqlo, these prices are hard to swallow, although probably justified given the style and quality. the coach cafe iced matcha made me feel nauseous. after that we ate flowerchild on the uber ride to mud studio. we had 3 hours, and a max of 3 pottery items to make. i learned that you need to stabilize your arm on your hip, and most of the force comes from your body and not from your arms, and its important to keep it stable, and to not make it too wet, or everything will fall apart, and to also keep a moderate speed. i saw the instructor swiftly make a long and tall pot without breaking a sweat, while i was having trouble even making it into a nice bowl shape. after that we had dinner with A and H. it started out as a light dinner, then it went into a philosophical conversation that i just did not have the bandwidth or capability to articulate myself well. it might be the late nights and sleep deprivation. but overall it was nice to have another moment where me and T interact with other people. it's an opportunity we don't a lot being 1772 miles away from each other.
