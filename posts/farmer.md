from a [tweet](https://x.com/QCompounding/status/1795700139782545589):

- Don't shout at the crops
- Don't blame the crop for not growing fast enough
- Don't uproot crops before they've had a chance to grow
- Choose the best plants for the soil
- Irrigate and fertilise
- Remove weeds
- Remember you wil have good seasons and bad seasons â€“ you can't control the weather only be prepared for it

Applies to life too.
