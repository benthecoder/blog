in the morning i had a meeting with dr. D. i came as prepared as i could so i wouldn't waste his time. i sketched out the existing system and got valuable feedback on how to improve it. it's awesome to have experts provide their insights.

after the meeting, i went for my braces appointment near clement. the dentist wasn't confident about my lower teeth, so whether i can finish my treatment now is uncertain. since i'm moving to miami, things are more complicated. do i take the braces off and go for invisalign?

the plus side is they didn't do anything extra so i could still eat. we went to thai time restaurant and the food was so authentic. the pad thai and pad see ew were great, and the red thai tea too. pad thai was sweet and pad see ew was savory. that's the conclusion.

after that we went to pixlcat coffee to get some work done, mostly me organizing my thoughts on how to improve the system. then we went to green apple books, spent about an hour there before we went to valencia street. we went into open editions and paxton gate. then had dinner at echigo with the mafia. it's nice to meet everyone again, especially W, given he was just discharged from the hospital. i wonder when the next time we can all be together again.
