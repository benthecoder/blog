I like listening the [Huberman lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) podcast.

Andrew is really good at distilling research and studies into small bits of practical advice.

The two biggest lessons I've garnered from his podcast are to get [sunlight](https://youtu.be/WDv4AWk0J3U?t=299) exposure in the morning for ~5 minutes, and [physiological sigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc) is effective in reducing anxiety and stress.

In his [episode](https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/) on goal setting and achieving goals, he shares 8 science-backed strategies.

They can be broken down into three main categories:

1. **Goal Setting:** how do we set the right goals?
   - **The 85% Rule** — you should set your goals so that you achieve them [85.13%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4) of the time (failing 15% of the time despite your best efforts)
   - **Make A Plan** — set SMART goals, create a specific set of action steps that get right down to details about what success would look like.
   - **Imagine The Worst** — write down/talk about how bad it will be if you don't achieve your goals, it’s motivating to think about what it will be like if you fail.
2. **Goal Execution:** how do actually do the actions required to achieve our goals?
   - **Outsmart Your Obstacles** — identify potential obstacles ahead of time and then planning out how to defeat them (foreshadow failure).
   - **Procrastinate with Other Tasks** — pre-task multitasking before a work session can actually help you generate adrenaline and get you into action.
   - **Focus Your Eyes to Focus Your Mind** — Focus your visual attention on a single point for 30-60 seconds, it increases levels of systolic blood pressure and adrenaline.
3. **Goal Persistence:** how do we stick with our goals?
   - **Have A Weekly Check In** — review the progress you’ve made on your goals once a week, “dopamine milestone” — a pit stop where you signal to your brain that things are moving forward.
   - **Reward Your Effort** — the next time you make an effort on something important — take note, and then take pride. Celebrate progress, not perfection, pat yourself on the brain.
