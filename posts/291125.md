i continued to read breakneck and found out that the one child policy was advocated by a rocket scientist named song jian. he studied cybernetics in moscow, then in 1978 encountered population control theories from the club of rome. he took those mathematical models, the same kind used for calculating missile trajectories, and applied them to china's population. china being a country with barely any human rights, they engineered the entire country based on these extrapolations. it made me realize i do not want to live in china.

later that night we cut each other's hair. it was a new experience.

we also finished the psalms book sketch. it was the first art we finished together.
