- 酷狗 60s previews played and 因为爱请 is stuck in my head now
- Zhou Yongjiu – China’s Van Gogh
- There are so many similar shops and try oil panting places in Dafen, how do I decide which to go
- Would be nice to operate your own mini cafe + jewelry store in a small town, refilling the water in the flower vase, meeting new people, playing Jay Chou in the background, pouring cat food in the bowl for when your cat comes back from exploring outside, recommending food and shops
- I wonder why girls like to shop for jewelry, it’s like my interest for pretty book covers and artsy things
- Install 大众点评 for food
- How long does it take to oil paint on average, if sketching already takes me that long, guess it depends on the style, impressionism can have less detail while realism is very detailed
- 热干面 with vinegar is good, I’m gonna make my own
- Only 30¥ for trying out oil painting (油画体验专业指导）, so cheap, 50¥ for a slightly bigger one
- Oil painting is so hard, i tried pointillism on the wave art lol, i dont know enough color theory to mix colors well, hard to fix mistakes or make changes if i lose the colors. I need to reference someone’s impressionism wave art to tell if mine is bad or not, cause I think I did bad for my painting, the teacher kept fixing mine.
- The teacher/artist asked me to take a rest and look at it from a distance lol, I think i was too tense and serious and doing the same thing over and over again
- I didn’t get to go to their art museum :(
- I wouldn’t mind living in Dafen they have strong art culture and its a chill location
- Their artworks are cheap 25¥ for a small framed painting
- 快狗打车 is china’s Uhaul
- Luckin coffee is their starbucks
- Traffic is bad here took 40 min to get to dongmen
- Dongmen has so many people
- 大麦茶 tastes like coffee
- 鲈鱼 taste good the fish texture is crispy
- Why is it 安全出口 is there an unsafe 出口
- Shopping in dongmen is like shopping temu or shien in real life but even cheaper, i bought two baggy pants and a shirt for only 180¥
- My dad has so much courage lol i could never cut prices like that I’d be so uncomfortable
- I never thought I would buy fake Nikes but they’re actually feel and look so real, hope they last long though. They’re only 35$ too which is insane
- I find it stressful to shop for clothes and interacting with people, maybe its the insecurity again, I don’t like checking myself in the mirror
- Store owners here are so good at selling, they’ll recommend me clothes, then ask me to get shoes and pants as well, and praise the quality of the shoes, but I wonder how much of it I can trust
- We were here from 7 pm till 12am wow
- Taxis are 2.7¥ per kilometer
