![bike ride at the office gym](/images/080126-bikeride.jpg)

parents left for malaysia today. i wasn't as sad this time, knowing they'll be back soon once i'm settled in miami.
went to the office after two months. back to flower child. tried out a biking simulator where you could play games. it was addictive. the animation was minecraft-like. it felt more fun than a peloton. peloton is corporate gym, this expresso HD feels like a local-owned fitness center. took a break at night to catch up on my blog. this place is my safe place, my way of decompressing.
