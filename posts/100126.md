![austin public library card](/images/100126-apl.jpg)

lunch at flowerchild. i got yakisoba noodles, this time without sauce. then went up to the office to work.

i got my austin library card. i was looking forward to getting this card not for books but for one free 3d print each month. i submitted a print job for an xteink x4 case using a free design i found online.

then went to TJ, got steak, smoked salmon, bananas, spinach.

til:
- postage stamps cost $0.78
- ponzi scheme was named after italian con artist charles ponzi, who arbitraged international reply coupons for postage stamps
- transformers are a strict superset of CNNs, can handle multiple modalities, and also take advantage of parallelism (source)
- "easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible" - larry wall on perl
- syncretism: merging of various beliefs/schools of thought
candles have memory, and when you first burn candles, you have to be careful not to let unmelted wax remain on top. doing so will cause candle tunneling, where the surrounding layers become harder and less likely to burn evenly
- you can rent the entire isabella stewart gardner museum for 30k
