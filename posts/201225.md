i brought my parents to kinokuniya at airport blvd, which also has daiso, 99 ranch, and a bunch of other asian stores. we then had dinner at bun belly.

i was curious why this area became such an asian commercial hub, so i dug a bit into the history. the gist is rent was cheaper in this area, whereas south lamar was more expensive and for the wealthy. it also ties in with immigrant settlement patterns in the 2000s as people moved for tech jobs.
