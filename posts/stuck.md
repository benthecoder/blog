I've been getting stuck at my work lately.

I'm laying the foundations for the codebase for my team which means I have to set everything up from scratch.

I keep facing issues with the setup process that I fail to divert my attention to other more important tasks.

I'm a victim to sunk cost fallacy, I've already spent that much time for this library, that switching over to a new library just takes more time. I did not want to call it quits.

When I get stuck, I easily lose sense of the motivation behind my work. I get annoyed by these blockers, and see them as time-wasting activities. I forget the big picture for the work that I do.

I need to constantly remind myself that I'm lucky to be able to try out new packages and tools at Tesla. And that I have the opportunity to face these errors, which is a means of collecting experience, and helping me grow as a programmer.

Instead of complaining about the errors, and being deflated, I should look at things from a different perspective.

Take a deep breath, note down your blockers, take it step-by-step, break down the problem, utilize the resource around you to fix the issue. If all else fails, find a new solution.

Facing a lot of issues is the key to prerequisite to becoming a good problem-solver. No one in life has become an expert by doing the easy things. They ran into challenges that no one has faced before, gathered all the facts, and found a way.
