woke up with a sore throat and i knew immediately that i was going to stay home today.

couldn't help myself and kept working on deeptalks. added support for traditional chinese, and cleaned up the codebase before i post it in public.

watched aliens covenant, i thought it was pretty good. it was more philosophical, a machine that humans created to save ourselves, ended up engineering the perfect species that will end us in the end. a machine that was too idiosyncratic that could think for itself.

bought a domain for deeptalks for 4 bucks on porkbun. to anyone reading this, try it [here](https://deeptalks.us). hopefully it'll still be up by the time you read this.

got so sick of staying home that i went to the ferry building to take some pictures. was blessed with a beautiful sunset at pier 1. a 40% fair sunset prediction by sunsethue still turned out pretty nice. worked on homework at the open tables in the ferry building beside the bookstore.

cooked my signature comfort meal miso soup with tofu and seaweed with noodles, add a bit of sesame oil. miso soup is a dish i want to perfect. i could do so much more, like making my own konbu, adding other garnishes, try out different variations. a lot of room to experiment. i should be more creative with my cooking.
