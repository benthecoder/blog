first time series class. it's nice to see the latest methods in my class. professor S is well-updated. learning about ARIMA now, flashbacks to the meta interview where i had to explain what arima does. i did not retain most of the information i shoved into my brain.

went to social study to get work done. time series lab, hw1, and my research work. discovered tmux today and it is so useful.

my multitask training is constantly erroring out, ALLGATHER errors because i'm doing ddp with these evals.

bought design of everyday things and to the lighthouse from browser books. i love discounted books that are good. it's always like finding treasure. usually those books are low quality books that nobody reads.

mock interview A with T. interesting to see them interacting together. i'm looking forward to more interactions between us and other people. i feel blessed.

decided to just do single GPU and let it run for 16 hours. fingers crossed i get something.

slept at 1:39 A.M. meeting with jinav3 second author at 7:30 am tomorrow. i've never worked this hard in my life. this paper deadline is both a blessing and a curse. i always go all in to things. maybe that's a good thing.
