> And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is. â€• Kurt Vonnegut Jr., A Man Without a Country

I find myself dwelling on in the past a lot.

I ruminate about moments where I wish I said or done things differently.

I worry about the future. I get anxious about my life trajectory after graduation, about making the right decisions, and about my health.

Even when I was in Yosemite, I was stuck in thought.

I want to live in the present more.

And this quote is a good reminder.

I don't want happy moments to just [float past](https://youtu.be/lqaRbnR8xUY) me.

I want to catch it, feel it, and hold in close to my heart, take a snapshot of it, document it, absorb it, and store it in my treasure trove of good memories for as long as I can.

I want to dwell less on hard times, because they only grow larger and scarier in my head.

Next time I'm at work, at SF eating Chinese pastries, having dinner with friends, reading a good article, looking at flowers by the road, listening to music, I want to be able to notice it, and say "if this isn't nice, i don't know what is"
