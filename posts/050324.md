![Morning Sun, 1952 by Edward Hopper](/images/morning.jpeg)

I woke up lethargic today.

I sat in front on my computer and I couldn't bring myself to do anything at all.

I felt a complete lack of interest and will to do the things I used to do.

Maybe it's the antibiotics causing me fatigue, or my body is still recuperating from the surgery.

I was staring out the window a lot.

Just thinking. Thinking about thinking. Sitting with my feelings. I've done everything I set out to do. Now it's time to live up to them.

I decided to just read today. Nothing else. Oh and a lot of YouTube.

I was reading [Several Short Sentences About Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13155290-several-short-sentences-about-writing) by Verlyn Klinkenborg.

I like this quote

> “Without extraneous words or phrases or clauses, there will be room for implication. The longer the sentence, the less it’s able to imply, And writing by implication should be one of your goals. Implication is almost nonexistent in the prose that surrounds you, The prose of law, science, business, journalism, and most academic fields. It was nonexistent in the way you were taught to write. That means you don’t know how to use one of a writer’s most important tools: <mark>The ability to suggest more than the words seem to allow, The ability to speak to the reader in silence. </mark>”

I had walking tour videos playing on my monitor.

I went to [Venice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kccv6YJZ0P4), [Florence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aZlTVnq2eQ) and hiked [Alta Via 2 in Dolomites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKcnvPDgifA).

I also went to [Tübingen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVAVdk819TI), a picturesque town in the southwestern part of Germany. The entire town looked like bright, vibrant paint was spilled all over, everywhere.

And this [japan cat island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjfuB8Xjhc4).

I want to travel so bad.

I stumbled on a couple cute videos like [how to wash a kitten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymxEmbALjIo) and this [Shiba Inu store clerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6CcUj2mDbI)

I've been binging on photography videos, I found this really good series on [Visual Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTQtLjIqecdydlanOGh6iwoWOb9VxpDts). Going to dive deeper into this when I get my camera and start shooting.

I also discovered [the funniest girl in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJF5XlNzDgY). I like her personality.

I found a lot of calm, relaxing playlists

- [낭만](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw4N_GoIA-k)
- [Dreamy songs that take you back to simpler times | a relaxed playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJu15Qq3To&t=2085s)
- [playlist for calm moments ~ sped up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjBVw3NWvYI&t=146s)
- [last days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6yq-HfwnFc&t=189s)
- [(playlist/jazz) a collection of jazz that is not loud and calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p22EqQBYRBM)
- [rain, books and coffee (playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-bI0AhSyU0&t=5s)
- [Peace.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBgloVgJD7M&t=535s)

And a nice [read with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfcnpktwuq0) video.

I'm also obsessed with [camcorders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1I0Z9uldlg) now. I'm thinking of getting one for my travels.

I'm grateful YouTube exists.
