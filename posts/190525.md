we rode the waymo to japanese tea garden before 9 am so it's still free to enter.

we then walked to conservatory of flowers, hoping for flowers, but it's tropical plants instead. the flowers outside were still being planted.

we took the second waymo to city hall to take some pictures. many happy couples were taking wedding photos.

we left to eat at zen yai, a thai restaurant in tenderloin. i had pineapple fried rice, reminds me of the thai food i used to have back at home.

we walked to books inc. parents were falling asleep at a bench. the shop owner held a dog in his arms. i want to own a cat bookstore / cafe.

we took our third waymo back home.

i cooked w mom and watched some of mission impossible rouge nation. we talked of watching the last ever one in the series when i go back home to malaysia.
