> "Then love her. If the feeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her."  
> "But how do you love when you don't love?"  
> "My friend , love is a verb. Love - the feeling - is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?”

i watched yes man and liar liar. both are comfort movies that brings laughter to my soul. i like the concept of yes man, that to an extent, saying yes to more things will get you out of your shell, and lead you to unexpected connections and opportunities. it's a promise to yourself to change.

i walked to ferry building to get some work done. i wrote up notes for what to say in my presentation tomorrow and caught up on my blogs. i walked around the shops, looking for things to buy for T's parents. everything is pricey here. i wish they had free wifi, ferry building would be the best (free) cowork space if so, i like watching the sea and the island and the bridge.
