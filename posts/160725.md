taught teresa some frontend dev today. i used [full stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), the course by helsinki. it was fun teaching her. i realize how much i don't know until i try to explain something. and i love the process of figuring things out together. i believe that's why teachers became teachers, because they stumbled on the joy of teaching one day while explaining to their friends about a certain concept or topic. but our system does not suppor them well enough. personal ai tutors will eventually take over. what will happen to the teachers?
