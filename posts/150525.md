i met up with Prof L today on zoom after so long. she gave me assurance about my future. a clearer path. it will be next year, in september, and it will be 4 years of my life, possibly 5. there is still more to talk about, but it concerns me. i wonder if it's worth throwing my life into research now, but if my goal is to work in MSFT or GOOG deepmind, i feel that is the only path for me.

i spent 2 hours booking flights that evening, and finding accomodation. and worked on the presentation slides for my practicum the rest of the night. there has to be an agent that books flights for me, it should ideally have context about filght price dynamics, and track the specific dates for my travel, and be able to book flights with my info, and cancel if something better comes up. and also take into account the rewards of my card. i can't wait for the day we all have personal agents do tasks for us.
