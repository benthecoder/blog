- first nights are always the hardest
- already planning events to join this and next week.
- first human I saw in the hotel, almost spilled my lemon ginger tea
- housing is sooooooooo expensive
- foam vs spring mattress, spring is breathable and foam is good for body?
- did not know SF charges for trash
- slept for 2 hours and it’s the most satisfying sleep i’ve had this entire year
- forgetting that I’m in SF, the buildings are so nice
- Saw a young couple with a baby stroller, feels like I rarely see this in the city. how much do you have to make to build a family in the city?
- When will bankers be replaced
- The fact that internationals cannot open account online is so frustrating
- do i ever need a savings account?
- bank teller: “they just break the windows and not take anything and walk away”
- Mmm whatcha say song
- seeing so many asians around, curious who my friend group will be
- Lois Cobelo photographer
- snow garden 26 for beef with ginger and onion and two rice
- eating chinese food with a bunch of elderly chinese people around playing cards at portsmouth
- pigeons are trash birds for real
- found groceries at jackson st
- Chinatown Him Mark Lai Library is comfy
- tried to get a library card
- i want to switch my iowa license to california asap
- first time touring a house, 10XX jackson st is so nice, like the green walls, it's basically a straight line which is cool, but room is really small, i can envision living here, walking to buy groceries from VegiLand Market with cash, buying plants from Sandy's Lucky Bamboo & Florist, going to the public library, passing by the Chinese hospital.
- already fantasizing when we're not even accepted by the owner yet
- weather is perfect
- Ina Coolbrith Park has nice views
- lombard st crowded as ever, two hippie vans
- ate leftovers at george sterling park
- washington square park is chill
- saw a girl sketching Saints Peter and Paul Church
- city lights bookstore
- joe & the juice “go away doc” at montgomery
- it was like finding water at a desert, most thirst-quenching drink ever
- i feel guilty not tipping am I supposed to tip at a juice shop
- eyes are so red
- decided to take a short nap
- fever dreams at 8pm
  - Teeth fell out, hanging by brace, i shoved it back into my gums, heard it click back like it’s lego, blood came out, scared the heck out of me
  - Fruit trees by a street that dropped a lot of cut fruits around, oranges, berries, etc. you could just pick them up to eat they’re fresh and clean somehow
- woke up so confused at 9 something, panicking that I overslept
- learning how to be on the same team, to not be adversarial when facing differences, to be more understanding and patient, to be clearer in communicating my worldview and my needs, to seek clarification, to not take things personal, to be kind, to be considerate
- ate leftovers of leftovers, i like how this lasted the entire day
- feeling like I’m on vacation and I should be doing more, feeling like every minute my dad’s money is getting burned
- but i’m excited to show them around next year when i graduate
- hoping to be a SF local by then
