  - is walmart good? the prices are not great compared to costco

reflection:

got to stop claude coding so much and architect and plan and think more. have more taste. dont be code monkey. ask more questions. talk to more people. dont let fear or insecurities stop you from growing and gaining the trust of people in the company. i need a way to remind myself to take breaks. it is hard to furnish my apartment and focu son work.

tomorrow: GET A CHAIR SO I STOP SITTING ON MY LUGGAGE SLOUCHING ON MY MACBOOK

slept: 1:30am
