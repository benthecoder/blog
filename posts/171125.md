my fish porridge recipe that i cook with a rice cooker/pot when braces render my teeth unusable.

## ingredients

main
- 2.5 oz white fish (sole, grouper, cod, halibut, or tilapia)
- 0.13 lb rice (about 1/4 cup)
- 1.5 cups water
- 0.25 oz ginger
- 0.5 stalk green onion
- pinch of cilantro
- 1 egg white

fish marinade
- 0.25 tbsp cornstarch
- 0.13 tsp salt
- pinch white pepper
- 0.25 tbsp water
- 0.25 tbsp oil

seasoning
- 0.25 tbsp oil
- 0.25 tsp salt
- 0.25 tsp fish sauce (or soy sauce)
- pinch white pepper

## steps

prep aromatics
1. dice green parts of green onion (save white parts for another recipe)
2. cut ginger into thin slices, then julienne into thin strips
3. roughly chop cilantro
4. set aside for garnish

prep fish
1. squeeze out excess water from fish
2. slice fish at an angle into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces
3. mix marinade: cornstarch, salt, white pepper, water
4. gently mix marinade with fish using chopsticks
5. add egg white and mix gently
6. add oil and mix

cook congee
1. wash rice 3 times until water runs clear
2. boil 1.5 cups water in pot
3. add rice and stir well
4. when it boils again, stop stirring (prevents burning)
5. add oil, turn to low heat, cover
6. cook 25 minutes
7. uncover and whisk quickly for 1-2 minutes (creates thick texture)
8. add more water if too thick

finish
1. add fish slowly, spread them out
2. lower heat, mix fish around
3. add ginger strips and white pepper
4. season with salt and fish sauce
5. turn off heat, transfer to bowl
6. garnish with green onions and cilantro

## notes
- use white fish for less fishy oil
- don't stir after rice comes to boil
- whisking at the end creates the thick texture
- fish cooks fast because it's thinly sliced
