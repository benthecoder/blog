> Luke 1:1–4 (NIV): Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.

In the New Testaments, we have four [Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel) - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

All of them tell the same story about the life of [Jesus of Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jesus).

Though the four books have many similarities, each author presents a unique perspective on Jesus, emphasizing a different theme for an intended audience.

**Matthew** wrote mainly for Jews, emphasizing that Jesus, the son of David, was the Messiah for whom they were waiting. That’s why he began with a genealogy and includes multiple references to Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in Jesus.

**Mark** emphasizes Jesus as the Suffering Servant of God. This was especially relevant to believers in Jesus who were suffering for their faith.

**Luke** was written to Theophilus, a gentile. Luke presents Jesus as the Son of Man and Savior of all people.

**John** presents Christ as the Son of God and Creator of the world.

There's ongoing debate on the [historical reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels) on the Gospels.

One thing I found interesting is the only two events that are almost universally agreed upon are the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, and the crucifixion of Jesus by Pontius Pilate.
