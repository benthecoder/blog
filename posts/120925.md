finally got my code to merge for the extraction. my first big code merged. also kept working on getting the clustering to work well, and learned that hdbscan + umap reduction + diversity sampling worked better than kmeans.

also learned how to split mixed branches using cherry-picking. i'm still slowly learning the git language.

we had chilantro for lunch, and t tried out weight lifting. i ordered out of ramen tatsu-ya for dinner.
