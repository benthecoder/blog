![Battle Hall](/images/030126-battlehall.jpg)

brought my parents around ut austin. started at the harry ransom center to see the gutenberg bible, then took some pictures around the tower, walked by littlefield fountain which naturally led us to the blanton museum of art. wanted to check out the "austin" building by ellsworth kelly but you had to buy a ticket to get in.

after that took them to guadalupe x W 29th street - a cluster of thrift stores. hit alienated majesty books, lofi vintage, pavement, leopard lounge. dinner at sip pho. this place was surprisingly good.

til:
- ut austin has one of only 5 complete copies of the gutenberg bible in the us. printed in germany in the 1450s by gutenberg. it's the first book made with movable type. only about 150 were originally printed, and only 20 complete copies survive worldwide.
  - [sources](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5089) say it was purchased for \$2.4m in 1978 (about \$11.5m today)
- niépce heliograph is the world's oldest surviving photograph, and austin is the only place that has it. made in 1826 or 1827 by french inventor joseph nicéphore niépce. it's a view from his window - took 8 hours of exposure on a pewter plate.
- battle hall, designed in 1911 by cass gilbert (same guy who designed the woolworth building and the supreme court building). it was ut's first library and the first building on campus with the spanish-mediterranean style - red tile roof, cream limestone, arched windows.
