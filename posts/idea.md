Some notes from reading a book about design in the design reading room at the design building.

The word [idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea?useskin=vector) comes from a Greek term meaning "I saw", which picks up on the concept that an idea is **an image formed in the mind**.

[Creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity?useskin=vector) is best described as a mental process involving the generation of new ideas and concepts, and this process can be broken down into two pathways: [convergent and divergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking?useskin=vector#Convergent_vs._divergent_thinking).

It is believed that scientists and engineers display convergent thinking while resolving a problem; which is the deductive generation of the **best single answer to the problem**.

Whereas artists and performers display divergent thinking; the **creative generation** of **multiple answers to a problem**.

Divergent thinking can be utilized as basis for creative brainstorming.

Four basic [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming?useskin=vector#Osborn's_method) for brainstorming:

1. **Focus on quantity**: enhance divergent thinking
2. **Don't criticize**: foster greater, risk-free creativity
3. **welcome unusual ideas**: aid out-of-the-box thinking, leading to unconventional problem solving
4. **combine and improve ideas**: amalgamation of ideas create better solutions through process of [association](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Association_of_ideas&useskin=vector)

In a hackathon, coming up with an idea is the hardest part, but it's my favorite part.

I get to brainstorm with strangers I just met online, sharing interesting ideas and combining our unique backgrounds and skills, to build something fun.
