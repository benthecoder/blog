i slept in and it was too late to go to class. after lunch, i went to cap one to work on homeworks the entire day. the homeworks were about using a transformer model to predict sentiment, and another was setting up GCP to run mlflow. i typed all the code for building the transformer model, writing it line by line was a good practice. i can take a step further and write the transformer model from scratch when i have time in the future. i spent 4 hours on just homework today.

went to trader joe again with A to buy spinach and bread. did some more research work at night till i paassed out. i wish i was more disciplined in stopping and spending the time before bed winding down and reading.
