starting a weekly series sharing 7 things from my week.

1. hiroshi yoshimura - [time forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cSmrCOiby4)
   - this is the 4th song from the album "Soundscape 1 : Surround" 1986, stumbled upon it on youtube. it's relaxing
2. [STORM](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu) by stanford & [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com) from Hangzhou
   - these are incredibly useful, deepseek searches more links than chatgpt
3. mimansa's [software list](https://mimansajaiswal.github.io/posts/mac-softwares/)
   - a huge list of software that i will reference from time to time
4. [zachary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI-RN34CdD0) talks about abridge
   - [abridge](https://www.abridge.com) does ai transcription for clinical documentation, a company i can see myself working for
5. "how to like everyhing more" by [Sasha](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-to-like-everything-more)
   - micro skills to increase your ability to enjoy everything more, e.g. have better vocabulary increase the resolution of your enthusiasm, avoid "like" or "dislike", memorize poetry, learn geographical and historical context, appreciate art by pretending you're a buyer, shift attention to the hidden layers, etc.
6. "how to make something great" by [Ryo Lu](https://ryolu.notion.site/how-to-make-something-great), product lead @ notion
   - let curiosity roam, act from instinct and build to learn, pursue quality and agility equally,
   - "greatness is less a checklist than a delicate alignment of mindsets, methods, and morals"
   - "the gift of great creation is that, when done right, it looks both astonishingly fresh and deceptively familiar"
7. these new paper back edition Books Paperback edition of Joan Didion
   - saw this at the city lights bookstore, obsessed with the colors

read

- finished in praise of shadows
- read chapter 1 of confessions (so far it made me very pessimistic about my faith, i need to challenge my faith more for it to grow)

watch

- watched the witch (i'm now creeped out by goats)
- rewatch the theory of everything (i love everything about this movie)

i'll try to watch a good movie once a week.
