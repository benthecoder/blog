i felt too drained and tired to continue the hack. we went back to the hackathon at 1pm and they served pizza. we worked on the dataset still at 2 pm but i started to feel dizzy without food. i had to get out of the house. we went to eat at Tsing's chinese restaurant, i got bitter melon with pork which was decent, but wei got hard vegetables. we decided to go stonestown mall for wei to get a feel of a shopping mall. we went around daiso,

i played ping pong at the transamerica park with wei. he's forgotten everything i've taught him. my leg also hurts and i can't play like how i used to anymore. i want to get healed so badly. walking is my most treasured activity.

the rest of the night i was rotting on youtube a lot. then revised my contrary report on sesame, and tried to do some ucsf research work.
