![The Good Samaritan, 1633 by Rembrandt](/images/samaritan.jpeg)

> "I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and kindness to animals. I don't respect the law; I have a total irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer." – Brendan Behan

I was reading this piece by Roger Ebert "[Go gentle into that good night](https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/go-gentle-into-that-good-night)" which summarizes his beliefs about life.

He wrote a paragraph on kindness.

> "Kindness" covers all of my political beliefs. No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. <mark>We must try to contribute joy to the world</mark>. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.

It's a good reminder in life to be kind. And all it takes it to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier.

And that could be being a good listener, appreciating them, giving gifts, lending a hand, and checking in once in a while.
