i got these Parents Are Human [cards](https://parentsarehuman.com) in the mailbox today. also had a long chat with my lease office agent Z. it dawned upon me that there are people who don't know what NVIDIA is. i realized i live in a very small bubble. and maybe i need to talk to more people from diverse backgrounds. i also realized i can't really explain a lot of the things i think i know because they're so ingrained in the culture and space, like oh a gpu is that thing NVIDIA sells to AI companies to train models. but how do you explain a GPU to someone who doesn't know what a GPU is in the first place? it does matrix multiplication? it performs computations really fast? it is used to run games really smooth? it seems like i don't know what a GPU is as well.  in fact, i don't know how most things in the world works. 

here's an attempt with Claude's help

> A GPU does one simple math problem, and does that problem thousands of times at once
> 
> Your screen is made of dots. Each dot has a color. To show a picture, the computer has to figure out what color each dot should be.
> 
> A normal computer figures out one dot, then the next dot, then the next.
> 
> A GPU figures out thousands of dots at the same time.


a few examples

- LLMs: billions of matrix multiplication
- ray tracing: vector math (dot products)
- video encoding: discrete cosine transform
- bitcoin mining: hash functions (bitwise ops and adds)
