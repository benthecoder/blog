![the moon seen from pfluger pedestrian bridge](/images/020126-bridge.jpg)

watched wallace and gromit over lunch with my parents – a grand day and the wrong trousers. i can't believe this is more than 30 years. it oozes charm and is a spark of creativity

walked from home to the pfluger pedestrian bridge. twenty-five minutes felt like an hour. walking in austin is less enjoyable than sf.  sf has tight grids, each block the same size, buildings line the street without gaps. austin's downtown is cut in half by highway 35, the streets are wide and built for cars going 70 mph. walking feels hostile even when there's a sidewalk.

on the bridge i got an error on slack, and i sat on a chair, connected to my mobile hotspot and started writing a fix. after that we went to trader joes to stock up.
