notes:

- [notes to my younger self](https://yewjin.substack.com/p/note-to-my-younger-self)
    - people who love their work are faster, spot patterns, and build reputations that last
    - ASK WHY, dig beneath solutions to root causes. timebox curiosity, give yourself permission to explore within boundaries. build mental models of how things actually work
    - relationships exist when you're helpful, interesting, or both. be useful without being needy
    - bring joy to work. create fun, don't force funny. the teams who ship the best products are the ones enjoying building it the most

    - [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/): record what you shipped, problems you solved, people you helped, skills you're building, recognition received
    - what would make it a 10? act immediately on feedback, process it and implement and circle back
    - boss > title. who will you become after working for this person?
- [commit story](https://meks.quest/blogs/the-theatre-of-pull-requests-and-code-review)
