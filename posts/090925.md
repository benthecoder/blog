found another edge case that i did not know before. it's hard to have all the information gathered and laid out on the table for you before you start implementing. you often have to start first, find an edge case, iterate, and repeat. i wonder if there's a more efficient way of doing things. instead of what i did, could i had read through all of the files and build a knowledge base of what i should tackle and how i should've approached the problem, and consider the cases carefully, and sketch out everything? how can you do this while facing time pressure?

went to buy flowers at tj for t, i have never made a bouquet before and i had to do it in the uber. i eventually put it together but i could've done a better job. i saw her come through the exit and i had a burst of joy and peace. i felt like everything was good, and my life was complete. it has been 3 months since i last seen her. had dinner with colleagues at loro and then we went to amc barton creek to watch jaws. this was our first ever time interacting with other people as a couple, and it will the first of many more to come.
