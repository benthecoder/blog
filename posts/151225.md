we flew to sf together. it was our first time getting on a plane together, instead of saying goodbye at the security gates. we had a layover in atlanta and tried auntie anne's and chick-fil-a.

it was also when i heard news about W. i felt worried for him. the mafia had a call together and we caught up on what was going on. i never imagined him getting sick like this. we planned to pay him a visit when i reached sf.
upon landing, we waited a bit to meet up with my parents. we checked into the westin hotel and wanted to visit W downtown but visiting hours were over. i thought of contacting the pastor from the indonesian church we went to, to ask him to support W.

we all got hungry, and i ordered food from the night market which was amazing. the hainanese chicken was authentic. we stayed at the hotel together and called W and A. W updated us on his situation. T is meeting my parents and my friends. i'm unlocking new experiences for her.

after some time, we left and T and i checked into the majestic hotel. the hotel had lavish christmas decor in the lobby, and the room had downtown abbey vibes.
