woke up feeling groggy from last night. friends decided to not go class, so i stayed home too so i won't sit alone at class.

watched deadpool because i got bored. having the laptop by hp is highly destructive to my productivity and focus. i need to take it away soon. right after my aliens movie watching spree ends. watching romulus was a huge mistake in hindsight. it triggered a series of movies that i regret watching, because all it did was fill my head with junk, bloody and nonsensical junk.

went to class for my last ml lab class. committed to pay attention but i didn't even try. got distracted way too easily and, decided to make deep talks with v0 and nextjs. app was done by the time class finished.

it's so easy to ship and deploy something today. i enjoy doing this so much more than anything else. making and designing tiny apps that bring joy and connects people together. it's especially enjoyable when i can use it with friends and family.
