i went to class just for quiz today. had to leave class early because i felt so tired and dizzy i had to take a nap. ate my lunch cold as well because i didn't feel like microwaving chicken. after lunch was ml class, i saw my grades and it was better this time. i changed my answers to the wrong one again, i need to have more faith in myself and trust my gutu feelings.

i could barely pay attention again, kept trying to prepare for the time series quiz right after class. grouped up with W and we worked well together, even though we didn't get the expected solution. i realize i've forgotten how to code basic python and it's concerning. how do i incentivize myself to leetcode given that my true passion and interest is to make tiny apps and websites for my friends? i need to think about short-term vs long-term value. leetcoding now, in these 3 months will provide the long-term value i need, because my first job will matter more than anything, more than building something fun and cool.

spent the rest of the night working on the mongodb assignment and scribesystem.
