it was another school day for T. we had breakfast at the hotel cafe and walked to campus together again. i got to enter the siege building and worked there while T went for her class.

i was in the zone, blasting the steve aoki remix of Thriller by MJ. the halloween vibes were strong. we've been seeing students in costumes on the streets, marching on to somewhere, like gravity, they're all getting sucked to their respective destinations.

i doordashed curry katsu w udon from a japanese restaurant and nobody was picking up my order for almost two hours. it wasn't until one dude miraculously accepted it, i was so grateful i tipped the man 5 bucks right after prying it from his hands. he shouted back "thanks my man" before entering his car.

the katsu wasn't as warm anymore, but my stomach was no longer screaming for carbohydrates. i continued working till T met up with me again and we took a lyft home.
