![xteinkx4 user guide](/images/090126-xteinkx4.jpg)

went to the office, ordered hainanese chicken rice extra chicken for lunch and dinner, worked from 1pm till 3:30 am, kept getting stuck on issue of integrating my feature into a  new system. the pressure of getting things done fast is impacting my ability to slow down and understand the big picture and solve things methodically. i guess i will learn this as i gain more yoe working.

got my xteink x4 in the mail. i love the rise of calm technology, single use devices that do one thing extremely well. this pairs well with my innioasis y1.

a few useful links for the device. gathered from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7RuokaVauo) by pixel leaves
