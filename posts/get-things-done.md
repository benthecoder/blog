[Getting things done](https://sive.rs/book/GettingThingsDone) by David Allen is a classic book for productivity.

### 2 key objectives

1. **Capture all things** into a logical and trusted system
2. Make decisions about all the inputs you let into your life, so that you will always have a plan for **next actions**

### Clarify actions

Define (1) what “done” means (outcome) and (2) what “doing” looks like (action).

### Use a calendar

Three things go on your calendar: time-specific actions; day-specific actions; and day-specific information.

### Weekly review

- gather and process all your stuff
- review your system
- update your lists
- get clean, clear, current, and complete

### Big review

- life
- 3-5 year vision
- 1-2 year goals
- areas of responsibility
- current projects
- current actions

### 5 phases of project planning

1. Have an urge to make something happen.
1. Imagine the outcome.
1. Generate ideas that might be relevant.
1. Sort those into a structure.
1. Define a physical activity that would begin to make it a reality.

### Creating clear outcomes

One of the most important to hone and develop for both professional and personal success: ability to clear outcomes

examples:

- How would the ideal head of finance do his job?
- What would your Web site really look like and have as capabilities if it could be the way you wanted it?

### Close loops

check off tasks to gain energy boost and sense of progress

There are only two problems in life:

1. You know what you want but don't know how to get it, and/or
2. You don't know what you want
