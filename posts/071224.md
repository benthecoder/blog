> Isaiah 43:2 - When you pass through the waters, I will be with you

had fellowship with some young adults and families from chinese in burlingame. everyone here knew each other since they were kids, and now that some of them are parents, they're a tight knit group. so being in fellowship with them is an interesting dynamic. but they're all friendly, and i'm still able to make small conversations with them.

i thought about how if everyone was my age, or younger, i would fit in more. but i've been in those groups before. i realize i can learn more from these young adults. their answers are more concrete and wise, it's good to surround yourself with people who've walked on this earth longer than you.

having kids around in a group shifts the mood a lot. it also makes people more inquisitive. you get to see the world through the lens of an innocent and chaotic ball of energy. how they act and how they stumble around things, what catches their attention, what makes them happy. i think we're also envious of them, how they're so carefree. how brave they are, not be afraid of making silly mistakes. to fall and stand again.
