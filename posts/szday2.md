![mixC mall](/images/sz2.jpg)

- malls are a great travel destination when it's pouring rain
- so hard to navigate with baidu maps when I only know the english names of the malls
- electric cars are everywhere here in shenzhen, all the taxis I’ve been on are electric
- Lots of white and black cars too where are the other colors?
- I keep seeing 文明 everywhere and advertisements for exercising, respecting and loving others, protect the environment, etc.
  - Slogans like 文明你我也
- Their google maps shows the image of the road when taking exits which is so useful and clear
- Noticing they have a lot of greeneries again
- I like that their staircases have the flat slopes at the center to move your bicycles down, I even saw a motorcyclist go down using that slope
- Always go below ground floor for food when in malls
- I like that MixC shopping mall in 后海 has three themes, art, food and shopping
- They use WeChat for ordering food and they force you to become a member it's pre annoying, it was like this at the bookstore too and trying to borrow a powerbank
- Every website is blocked, even hackernews, but my api still works on my website, I wonder if API calls to google still works
- Realized it's hard to eat with family and not have my mind trail off and think about other things, maybe my family is bad at conversing while eating, or actually it’s hard to eat and talk and it's more comfortable to eat in silence
- It's so easy to go into autopilot mode when eating, so I was practicing how to appreciate the food I was eating by asking what it is, how it’s made, noticing the shape and texture like it's an art piece, and thanking the farmers that made the rice and vegetables and the butcher that killed the animals, and the chef that prepared all the ingredients to make the dish
- So many interesting snacks some of them I don’t understand what they are
- I wonder if chinese people read english with the same cognitive load as I do with chinese, or it's lower since english is “easier” to read
- They sell mini packets of rice in a big packet
- They have many interesting kinds of mushrooms
- So weird seeing Chinese names on familiar food packagings
- They have foreign literature as a category which has Russian, Irish, spanish, etc
- Still wondering why chinese books have nicer covers, hard to describe what makes them better, publishers have more money to spend on design, it's like both simple but elegant
- I will only be in literature and design+art sections in bookstores
- Lots of constructions and development going on
- Cleaners here are all chinese too

Some books + author I wanna look into

- fernando pessoa (sitting beside you watching the clouds)
- Vladmir nabakov poems
- Passed over lethe ezra pound poems

- The crosswalks here are crazy people just walk on them American style with cars so close to them
- So many kids with elderly people

- Shopping mall clothes are so pricey
- It's so hard to go into shops when there are fewer people and the clerks are eyeing you. Why do they do that. Just let me shop in peace
- I like it when the store decorates the place according to the name
- Chinese bookstores have stores within them selling ceramic ware , glasses, cafes and even restaurants, a lot of sitting areas, and sell a bunch of electronic devices, puzzles, even snacks
