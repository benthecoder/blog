Don't ask whether today will be a good day.

Everyday is a good day.

The real question is: **how much good can come out of today**.

Who's life can you add value to today?

What can you create today?

How can you use your time wisely?

What's something you should focus your attention more/less on today that will help future you?

What's something new you can experience?

Who do you need to catch up with? Relationships are work, and a lot of good can come out of a conversation with an old friend.
