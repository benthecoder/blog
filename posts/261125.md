![Mozart's Coffee Roaster](/images/261125-mozartcoffee.jpg)


our day out today started with mozart's coffee roaster. the cafe was festive, decorations were everywhere. i got matcha and she got chai. the matcha was watery. i read breakneck and she did some work.

after that we rushed to mayfield park as the sun was going down. i was looking forward to seeing peacocks. there were none. we walked the trail and saw a small lake halfway through, then a lakehouse. it reminded me of thrillers.

after that we went to livra books, a nice bookstore with secondhand books and vintage rare finds. any bookstore like that is always a good time.

then we went to central market. it was one of the nicest grocery stores i've been to. the fruits and vegetable section was amazing. there were in-house grown mushrooms, a whole section just for chilis. i got organic banana milk and we got some veges to roast. i was so hungry that i ate their roast chicken right outside the store. T laughed at that.
