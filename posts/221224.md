did some research into llm2vec, and outlined everything that i planned to do. i love papers that open sourced their code, you get to get right down to the metal. and apply their findings to your own data, and see whether you can recreate it. it's like plug and play. claude and chatgpt is so useful at breaking down concepts. i can't imagine having to do everything one year ago, things are moving so fast. it's hard to imagine what 2025 will be like. it's feels terrifyingly inevitable. intelligence that's so great and cheap we no longer have to measure it.
