i walked across the pfluger pedestrian bridge today, probably the first time i actually walked around austin since i moved here. i never realized how nice it is with the sunset across the skyline and the color and bridge reflected on the river. and people jogging and just lingering around. i walked along the bridge and wanted to keep going all the way home. but once i reached to the end of the bridge and to cafe at loren, it's still a 20 min walk. i decided to lime home.
