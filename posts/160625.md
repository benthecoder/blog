got a ride to teh airport with my sister and mom, they came along for the ride. they helped me pack everything

watched three movies on the plane

- grand budapest hotel: visuals are A+, the story was not what i expected, it was fun and sad
- the intern: old people have the most wisdom
- dune: cinematography was A+, disliked the ending.

the plane was so comfortable. flying united back was a grave mistake. i think i even slept 8 hours, the first time ever on a plane.

i went through customs with no issues. all they wanted was my f1 and asked when i graduate. forgot how cold it is in SF.
