> Do what you can. If you can't do something you wanted to do, then you will be forgiven, but if you don't want to try to do anything, you will not be forgiven. - Nikolai Vavilov

It's better to try than to never try at all.

Don't say it can't be done, without even trying it first.

Take the plunge. The first line of code. The first sentence. The first hello.

If it doesn't work the first time. Try again.

Look at things from a different perspective, talk to other people. Write about the issues you're facing. Document the journey.

Even if you fail a dozen times, and you still can't do it, you can say you've tried.

Do what you can. Only give up once you' exhausted all possible resource at your disposal, and you've thought of all possibilities.
