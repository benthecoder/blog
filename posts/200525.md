i went to see my parents at hotel des arts and ordered lyft for them to the airport, they're going to iowa to be with my sister.

i watched final destination during lunch, the curiosity drove me to watch it. it's an itch that i wanted to scratch, to see how gory it can get. the mri scene will stick in mind whenever i go to the hospital. i wonder how realistic it is.

it's my last semester of the program, and my last class ever. the semester passed by quickly, most of it was stressing out about jobs. now the final summer module will be about finalizing my plans.

i started coding the tauri app for papertrail but i kept facing 500 errors.

i also couldn't sleep this night. i laid awake fearing death and not amounting to anything before i die again. i felt like i wasted the entire year accomplishing nothing. i felt like i've grown too dependent on others and that my life revolves around T and my goals are too attached to her. if she's gone from my life, what happens to me? how do i self-differentiate?
