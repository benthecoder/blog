another bittersweet moment where i send T to the airport in an uber, and i wait until she boards before i head home.

to ease the pain i fiddle with porta pro limited edition rhythm beige on ear headphones, apply the yaxi earpads from amazon and also unwrap war and peace that just came in the mail, which was about 3x the thickness of the breakneck book. when will i find the time to read it? i don't know, maybe 5 minutes a day, maybe in one short sprint during the holiday season, or when i'm older and not working at a startup where i'm devoting 90% of my waking hours to work.
