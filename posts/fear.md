> Today can either be the best day or worst day of my life. It just depends on my perception

[Robert E. Grant](https://youtu.be/1XDpa2HLXV0?t=596) shared in his TED Talk about two ways to overcome fear.

First, practice gratitude. It's impossible to be fearful and grateful at the same time.

I was amazed at how effective this is. I think this happens because fear stems from our uncertainty about the future, and gratitude helps guide us back to the present moment, allowing is to focus on the people around us, the things we have now, and how lucky we are to just be alive.

This made me recall of the idea that [a wandering mind is an unhappy one](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-wandering-mind-is-an-un/). I think letting your mind wander can cause fear.

The second way is to be intentional about your decisions.

Everything that happens to you could be the best or the worst thing. It's all about your perception.
