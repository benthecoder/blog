> "Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space." â€“ Dr. Brand in Interstellar [1:28:00]

grinded on results for outcome prediction and embedding clustering for [67th AAPM](https://aapm.confex.com/aapm/2025am/cfp.cgi). the initial hypothesis and result that was the key ingredient for the abstract was missing and i freaked out. the entire day was spent on optimizing the results. had to look into [evaluators](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/tree/master/sentence_transformers/evaluation) in sentence-tnrasformers, swapped to BinaryClassificationEvaluator, and i got better results. so much of ML is the data and evals. without these two, no matter how fancy the architecture is, you won't get far.

finished watching interstellar with T. i'll never get sick of the soundtrack. and the Gargantua scene. that final scene where he flies into the deep space in search for her, and the screen goes black, leaving you with just your imagination to picture what happens next. it left me longing for space travel.
