had a talk that helped clear my anxiety and insecurities. i learned that it's really hard to be vulnerable and communicate your needs and uncertainty, it's something that i have to learn how to do more.

[10 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEMKXW2Wqs) push up with A. did homework at the library with A. had dinner at Sai's restaurant with chinatown mafia. talked about religion, lgbtq, morality, and culture. i should have more discussions with friends to know who i am. it's hard to do these if you're only conversing with yourself most of the time.
