There are [Golden Rules](https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4147) for being a good mentee.

Here are four key recommendations for best practice.

### 1. Select the right mentor(s)

- finding suitable mentors is a process of judgement and learning, there needs to be congruence between your goals and the skills and knowledge of the mentor
- Find someone with content expertise, or influence in a field, who has a wide network of contacts
- Someone in the top of their field isn't necessarily a good mentor, personal attributes (patience) and values (altruism) are fundamental to a good relationship. You should like, respect and trust your mentor.

### 2. Be respectful of your mentor's time and manage it wisely

- Be proactive in scheduling appointments, plan a regular slot
- Plan for meetings by setting out agendas and prioritising discussion points
- Include a timeline to schedule each item so the both of you focus on what is important
- Propose solutions to help your mentor decide which answer may be best ("managing up")
- request actions before meetings to help your mentor prepare "Please review X so we can discuss at our meeting"

### 3. Communicate efficiently and effectively

- begin with honest conversations regarding your goals and aspirations
- include a written plan of short and long term goals, which helps share a vision of success with your mentor
- Clarify roles and expectations on both sides to minimise conflict and disappointment.
- establish regular cadence of communication that includes goals and progress towards them, for example: summary of current project status, including progress and problems, discussion of new projects, etc.
- pay attention to your "talking-to-listening ratio", it should be less than one. You should be listening more than you are talking.
- Send focused messages with brief background that can be answered with "yes" or "no" are ideal

### 4. Be engaged, energising, and collaborative

- avoid emotionally draining behaviours, such as complaining, pessimism, and "snarking" about others.
- Show that you are mature and genuinely open to learning
- be an energy donor, not an energy recipient
- help drive projects forward, be proactive, and accept all comments as important learning opportunities
- Be a "closer" : someone who follows through on tasks in timely fashion and at a high standard.
- Be generous and honest in giving others credit, you're working with not just your mentor, but other colleagues and the wider scientific community.
