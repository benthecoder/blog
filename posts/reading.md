some highlights from Simon Sarris's [reading well](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/reading-well).

### The act of reading

- Reading is alluring. It has a nameless quality beyond satisfying desires for information and pleasure
- Reading is nearly solitary. At the beginning you are alone with just the characters. By the end, you are alone with just the author
- Reading is letting someone else model the world for you.
- And after finishing a very good book one is driven a little mad, forced to return from a world that no one nearby has witnessed.

### Read for the stories

- The goal is not to digest information, but to **layer over your reality with a fresh coat of moss**. Your own world becomes colored by these stories, so it is worthwhile to spend time seeking the excellent works from across cultures and history.
- A person who reads no great stories will be influenced by the few stories he does come across in life, for better or worse â€” and I think mostly worse.
- a life that is sown with stories is one better positioned to **think and dream**.
- He who has no poetry in himself will find poetry in nothing. A person that reads no stories is unready for life. A person that reads many stories will be open to yet more stories.

### Read more fiction

- But I think what is most valuable to read are the category of works that resist summary, and the commonplace nonfiction books rarely fulfill that.
- on fondness for non-fiction: I think this arises from a belief that superior knowledge of the world comes from non-fiction. This thought is attractive to people who build systems, but **over-systematizing and seeing systems in everything can be a failure mode**.
- Careful descriptions and summaries miss too much of the world. Hard distinctions make bad philosophy
- Reading fiction helps you become an **unsystematic thinker**, something that is equally valuable but more elided by some engineers. It is easy to maintain an intellectual rigidity. It takes more care to maintain **a loose poeticism of thought**.
