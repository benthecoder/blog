Y came to visit from Malaysia, and he drove me to ocean beach park, and we walked along the sunset dunes bike park. we talked about anything that came to our minds, side projects, agency, and about relationships. i'm glad that i started my blog, and i hope i continue to meet more people this way.

i worked on the shorthand prediction since i woke up, and had to miss church because of how much work was left to be done. after leaving for my short trip with him for 5 hours, i got back on the grind, and we rushed the assignment till 12am, the very last minute. i did not like this assignment. there were so many mistakes, and it all started from not clarifying initially. i need to show more care into everything i do, not just the things that matter. how i do something is how i do everything.
