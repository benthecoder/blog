i started applying to jobs after putting it off because of work and school and not finishing my projects and not feeling ready enough. i learned there is no right time, just do it as early as you can. i applied to 10 jobs and did not leave the house at all. it drained me completely. while doing the simplify -> claude to generate a cover letter -> tracking in notion process over and over again, i was using claude code to build an mcp job agent, one that would help me find connections to companies, and jobs to apply for, and it will automatically populate my notion page. i want it to run twice a day, and have it do CRM tracking for me. can notion support this already? can i host an agent in notion to perform search for me and update my page?
