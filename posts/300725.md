first day of my first every full time job. still crazy to believe im working here. it's a new arc in my life and i can't wait to build and ship cool stuff, and also learn a lot in the process. i had first day jitters. most of the day was about setting up credentials, getting access. i was assigned my first project, things move fast here. and my first task was to add my name to the website. that required running everything locally and also ask a query. then there was a 2 hour meeting where we reviewed the product. i love the pace and the structure of things. smaller startups are great to be close to the heartbeat. went to fusion dumpling because of a doordash $10 off, $23 in total for shrimp dumplings and 生煎包。 rest of the night was cleaning up and moving some more stuff to wei's house.
