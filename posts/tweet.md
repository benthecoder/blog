If you're looking to start on Twitter, here's Henrik's [user manual](https://twitter.com/phokarlsson/status/1788463381227225544) for Twitter.

> you use it as your notetaking app, saving thoughts you like
>
> reply to ppl who's thoughts you resonate
>
> when you've replied to each other a bit: go to dms
>
> after some dms: do a call
>
> be friends

I still find it hard to post my thoughts freely. I've been posting quotes, projects, and pretty images, but not any original thought. I'm insecure about my thoughts not being good enough to be shared. But my goal when I'm back in SF is to tweet more, engage more, and make more friends and meet them IRL to make use of every second there $^{[1]}$.
