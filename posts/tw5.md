- Had more 抓包
- 水煎包 is like a square char siew bao
- 12 pm and we’re still not out yet, dad has to work :/
- Taipei 101 food court is nice, classy interior and good food
- Singaporeans, Koreans and now arabians? Sitting beside them and hearing them talk feels like we’re moving across different countries
- Ponso no Tao , island of the people, orchid island
- Whats a good spot for taipei 101 hmm

- 载具 – electronic invoice
- FikaGo – 350 USD stroller for a pet
- Wasted too much time moving from malls to malls
- Sugar free soy milk still has sugar I was lied to
- I like that I can buy 豆浆 and a 水煎包 for only 40 at the station
- American club taipei
- Wearing a ring just gives me something to fidget around with, maybe its increasing my anxiety

- Yakitori restaurants that opens past midnight are great for chatting
- Walking around taipei past midnight is really peaceful
- Milky fish
- There's no way I can sit in a bus stop at 3am in SF

- Saw a guy jump rope and did pushups at 5am in the morning
- Saying goodbye is so hard
- face your fears early on. follow where they take you. "Where your fear is, there is your task" Jung
- there's timing for everything, just let life take its course
