woke up and talked for too long again to T. felt bad that i'm taking her sleeping hours. went to wnb at 400 alabama st, took a suspicious lyft ride but turns out it was just a glitch with the system. got there, talked to some people. food was delayed for an hour and it was a 30 min long queue for pizza, left for acapella instead. got food at gourmet carousel

walked back to chinatown, watched parade near portsmouth square. stood here for a solid 45 minutes before deciding to leave.

tried to get home, and A wanted to go to gym, got trapped by the parade and did an entire loop and ended at market street. they went to gym, and i wanted to see gam long. i saw it "resting" before it breathed life for the parade. i was fine until a homeless person talked to me which spooked me and i went home by myself.

wracked my brain for the right idea for almost 3 hours, trying to figure out what and how to pitch. slept at 2 a.m.
