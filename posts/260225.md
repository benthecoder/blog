![Praying Hands (Dürer)](/images/praying_hands.jpeg)

> "Humans are creatures who spend their lives trying to convince themselves that their existence is not absurd." –  Albert Camus

i went to church to practice piano for sunday's worship. it's my second time playing, i feel more relaxed about it this time. the songs are completely new to me, but they're not hard to learn. i recorded myself for her and for my family too. after practicing i went to the library to return some large books that i barely got the chance to read. i found that image of praying hands by Dürer. i told myself i'll sketch that one day on my remarkable. maybe during spring break. the rest of the day was a blur. i found myself attracted to pale cerulean (#9BC4E2), the color of julie robert's cardigan in notting hill where she said "i'm only a girl, standing in front of a boy." we spent 2 hours preparing for opencv podcast the next day, making the slides and an outline of what to discuss. we all make a good team.
