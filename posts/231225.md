![Mission San Antonio de Valero, San Antonio](/images/231225-alamo.jpg)

first day of the road trip to new mexico.

first stop was buc-ee's. tried their burger. the brisket and shredded pork were not bad. i dislike the sweet sauce and white bread but purely for health reasons. they taste pretty darn good.

we first visited the alamo. the inside was smaller than i thought. in my head i'd figured the alamo would be a bigger church. we did one of the mini tours where a guy explained the history in a theatrical manner, then watched a short clip with sound effects of the battle. we stood in the same room where women and children hid during the battle.

after that we walked to the riverwalk. it's very unique. i wondered whether a flood would affect it, there has to be a good flood control system in place. i took a ton of photos. i'm so glad i have my fujifilm x100s. it takes great photos, although not as sharp as a full frame camera or the x100vi, the colors are beautiful.

before continuing the trip, we stopped at whole foods for snacks and supplies and stayed at holiday inn in ozona for the night.
