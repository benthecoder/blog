> The structure of our social media feeds place us in a [Never-Ending Now](https://perell.com/essay/never-ending-now/). Like hamsters running on a wheel, we live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption — a merry-go-round that spins faster and faster but barely goes anywhere. Stuck in the fury of the present, we’re swept up in dizzying chaos like leaves in a gale-force wind. Even though on the Internet, we’re just a click away from the greatest authors of all time, from Plato to Tolstoy, we default to novelty instead of timelessness.

I scroll Twitter a lot these days. I feel the urge to keep up, to be constantly fed with the latest tech news or I'll shrivel and waste away, as if learning about how this company open-sourced another small model that performs better than GPT-4 on benchmarks will provide the life force to keep me alive.

What differentiates a person who scrolls on an endless feed of social media and someone who blocks out time daily to read books like "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium"? What allows one to be complacent with wasting their precious days away on meaningless, mind-numbing, dopamine junk food, and what drives the other to improve oneself by [lengthening the gap between impulse and action](https://youtu.be/HTfYv3IEOqM?si=Kujw5orTb-CW7Y0r&t=2224) and focusing on developing oneself?
