printed llm for medical papers, read it in the bus to the airport. bus 8 -> 292 to hyatt regency, takes 1:30 hrs.

went one round in the ODSC expo hall and talked to companies

came across [delphina](https://www.delphina.ai), an AI agent for data science. would be an interesting company to work at.

had food truck Watani Spot for lunch

we all talked to B and he's always sharing his experiences with job search. not looking forward to multiple rounds of interviews for new grad roles. i should start leetcoding.

worked on assignments at the international arrival terminal for 3 hours. felt slightly nervous and excited.

saw family and it all felt very familiar, no excitement, but it just felt normal. i wonder if that's a good thing or not

glad W and A were here to help with the luggages and moving into the hotel.

i should plan places to go for my family. going to be a doozy trying to optimize for different things the next few weeks.
