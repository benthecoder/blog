I believe anyone wants to be in a position where they can **make money, have fun, and do good**.

[Matt Mochary](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-fire-people-with-grace-work#details) [writes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_8WALoefgBCQ9cR0Jgwztt_8-ppjJ1r7zpeyoikTa0/edit?folder=0B9tanFUuwmYSMHIyU2pkYTZSVkU) in his [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit) that if you try to optimize for all three, you'll end up in a place that provided none.

So now I'm optimizing for making money, because that will give me the financial stability I need to have fun and pursue my passion, and the resources to do good.

He talks about how the feeling of success in making money lasted a week, and having fun lasted for years, but changing lives by **doing good**, it's a deep satisfaction that he's never felt before. And it's the **best feeling that you'll ever experience**.

This is what's motivating me to work in FAANG as a SWE or MLE in the US, because they pay an [absurd amount](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=John%20Deere,Workiva,Wells%20Fargo&track=Software%20Engineer) compared to other places in the world.

My hope is to [collect experiences and people](http://bneo.xyz/posts/career-advice) here, and then have fun at the same time doing hard and fulfilling work.

Once I've learned all I can, it'll be time to do good. To start a company. To give back to the people who helped me get there.

I look forward to that day.
