feels like life just got hard reset. what was supposedly an exciting internship that will help jump start my career is now just a lie that provided all of us momentary happiness and comfort. the upside of this is i'm now more challenged, the grind doesn't stop,

i'm now more motivated than ever to learn the fundamentals in AI, and build and post in public. time to read [Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-massively-parallel/9780323984638/) and [Machine Learning Engineering Open Book](https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering?tab=readme-ov-file) and work [from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts).
