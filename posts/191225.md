i tried out gpt image 1.5 and it was surprisingly good. less for the utility but for pure entertainment, watching my mom laugh at the images it generated. i wish in an ideal world ai features like this continue to only provide short bursts of joy and laughter, not all the other bad effects of ai slop.
