i showed up at a client meeting outside and had my camera off. i got flamed by the big C. learned my lesson to always be prepared. it has become my first impression for them and i have to work harder to make up for it. spent the day cleaning up my PR. and had issues integrating react leaflet since it moved to the Hippocratic 2.1 license, and that meant it is not approved by open source initiative (OSI), and on my PRO arnica kept firing an alarm about a license risk. gpt kept giving me the wrong advice that downgrading the version was the solution. but the true solution was to just use the vanilla leaflet package that is still under BSD-2-Clause
