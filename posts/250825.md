[7 lessons for productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-c2uJvv7Y)

everything we have is a gift and we must use it to help others

1. have a clear vision for your purpose
2. we are makers, all our actions involve making something different that it was, doing is making
3. sloth vs rest, know the difference between laziness and rest
4. all human work is imperfect, we must make peace with imperfection and finitude
5. act on insights immediately, capture semindal ideas when your mind is ripe with insights
6. work steadily and consistently, a thousand small faithful chops brings down great trees
7. always look forward, never be more satisfied with past achievements than excited about future ones.
