had breakfast and went back to nap in bed. 8 hours and i'm still sleepy

went to chinese methodist church with family. they celebrated one of the pastor's 70th birthday. everyone is so welcoming. one of the members met her husband at church and got married. she was very friendly

got scammed by a lyft driver. it took considerable effort to get a refund back. i couldn't report that i wasn't picked up, this scam is pretty smart. had to report that the driver was unsafe to get to an actual human being.

took lyft to asian art museum. lots of buddhist and hindu statues and art that i wasn't that interested in. the jade ones were cool.

saw city hall for the first time. it lights up past sunset. the sunset is so pretty here.

went to sfpl main and got 'the concept of anxiety' by kierkegaard, get together (stripe press), and a psalms journal book.

went to do laundry in north beach

took accutane the past few days and headaches have been severe. it's clawing my brain from the inside
