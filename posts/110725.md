watched two movies

1. what women want: mel gibson is very charismatic
2. cruel intentions: they're both so evil but it's so entertaining to watch

got on fb marketplace and decided to get a dell 24 inch s2417dg for $70. took the muni down to hayes valley for it. i carried it all the way from the montgomery st. and stopped by belden st for the annual bastille day. i looked like a homeless with a big blue ikea bag.

got home and started testing and playing around with it. the first immediate thing i noticed is blackness is not black enough. which really frustrated me being in dark mode 99% of the time.
