A raw draft of notes I took at church today at Resonate, Fremont.

> But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. - 1 Timothy 6:9 ESV

Love for money is root of evil (v 10.)

Not tithing is stealing from God.

Money blinds us from who we are, induces pride and haughtiness, makes you unteachable

It blinds us to how much we have, we buy and enjoy things you couldn’t before, **luxury becomes necessity**

Luke 12:15: Watch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed

Why watch out? Its hard to know you’re greedy.

We say we just want to be comfortable, we’re self justifying

1 Timothy 6:6: Seeking contentment

Godliness with contentment is great gain

Wealth is a way of finding safety and uncertainty, you do things out of fear

A way of getting security, but not emotional or relational security

Philippians 4:11-13

Contentment
I can do all things through him who strengthens me

Christian happiness by three things

- bad things turn out for good
- Good things can never be taken from you
- Best things are yet to come

You meant for evil but God meant it for good

Paul found contentment and peace in prison, facing 39 lashes facing death

How to be set free?

Seek grace. Enjoy grace.

Job said: Naked I came into the world. Nakedness I leave the world

The Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord

Nakedness is utter vulnerable. Needing security, affirmation, love, protection
