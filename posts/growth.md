When I was working with Tesla during the summer, I felt I had to put my personal development on hold, because everyday when I got back from work, I felt mentally depleted.

It felt like a zero-sum game.

But [finite mental energy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9599441/) is a fallacy.

[Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7238509/) suggest it's not a depletion of energy, but a change in focus.

Instead of energy like a bucket of water being emptied, it's a hose that is channeled in a different direction.

So how to nurture your mental energy?

Here are 3 simple ways

1. **Manage your focus**
   - challenge the idea that you're "out" of energy at the end of the day, expand your energy by directing it towards something that feeds your curiosity and creativity
2. **Reflect** on how energy flows between various areas of your life
   - take time to look at your personal and professional projects, see how you can create synergy. Is there a topic you're personally curious about that you can bring into your work? This way you can grow in both areas at the same time.
3. **Surround yourself** with energy expanders
   - Connect with people who also believe in nurturing and expanding their mental energy.
