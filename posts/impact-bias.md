> Greek philosopher Epictetus: Going lame is an impediment to your leg, but not to your will.

A famous [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/690806/) by Northwestern University in 1978 discovered that the happiness levels of paraplegics and lottery winners were _essentially the same_ within a year after the event occurred.

One loses their ability to walk, the other gets rich overnight. Within a year, the two were equally happy.

Why? We overestimate the impact that of extreme events will have on our lives.

This is known as the [Impact Bias](https://jamesclear.com/impact-bias), because we tend to overestimate the length or intensity of happiness that major events will create.

Main takeaway: Focus on the constants in life, not on what changed.

We all die one day, there's only 24 hours in a day.

Relationships have ups and downs, health isn't guaranteed.

Watching the sunset at the beach and a stroll at the park is still nice.

Reading a good book, eating a good meal, spending time with friends and family, are all things you can still enjoy even if you go lame.

The human experience is broad and varied.
