woke up at 1:36 pm and my meeting was fortunately pushed back by 30 minutes.

had a discussion, got my action items and things are clearer.

worked mostly the rest of the day till 7pm until i was forced to leave for cvs to get my medication.

my Rx:

- cyclobenzaprine 10mg (muscle relaxant)
- methylprednisolone 4mg (roids)
- tylenol (pain)
- esomeprazole (stomach)

feeling better with that steroid injection, thank God for health insurance.
