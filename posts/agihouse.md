I was at [WING Autonomous Apps Hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/uYzDzXUstD8D8kvuA8Zl) @ AGI House today

It was at a mansion where a bunch of VCs live.

I was in the presence of a bazillion YC AI startup founders, PhD students, and FAANG engineers.

There was crazy energy at the event. Everyone was building something with AI.

A part of me was feeling major insecurities, I felt out of place, and unworthy. Another part of me was just glad to be in the circle, where you hear people talking about their startups, casually saying they used to work at Google, they went to Stanford.

I teamed up with a bunch of undergrads, a Palo Alto Councilmember with a tech background, and an ex-googler.

We built a automated marketing tool for campaigns, using agents to extract relevant information from donors and the politician, and draft personalized emails.

It was fun building this, I worked on integrating agents with gmail, but it was finnicky and I ended up just using google-api for drafting the emails.

It was exciting at the end, we were racing against time trying to tie all the pieces together, and have something presentable.

I'm still not making use of the opportunity to talk to founders, and learn about what it's like to be in YC.

I should compile a list of questions to ask next time. And be more aware of the benefits I could reap from making connections and building my network.
