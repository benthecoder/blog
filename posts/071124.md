migraine in class again.

worked on my research paper summarizing app so i can digest papers quicker and more efficiently

anthropic's prompt caching and pdf beta features are super useful. dumping their docs into cursor is also helpful for iterating and refining the prompt strategy

published my [app](https://readpaper.streamlit.app), planning to do a twitter post. i have to utilize my anthropic credits somehow. might as well build more and ship in public.

cooked mille-feuille nabe, i like the mushroom cutting technique that makes it look extra fancy. mistake was not drying the beef slices with paper towels, using chicken, and adding too much water. it also lacked flavor. the broth matters a lot.
