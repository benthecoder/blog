we took the light rail to downtown. our first stop was uniqlo. the mission was to find a fleece jacket to brave the weather. 

we went on a side quest to design our own t-shirt. we each had 5 moves to make, alternating as we added our own unique stroke onto the canvas on the ipad. the final result was cute. 

we went to [olympia coffee](https://artisansgroup.com/portfolio/olympia-coffee-downtown-seattle), tucked in the lobby of U.S. Bank Center, which, despite the dull name, is an indoor-street style public space with large cylindrical columns and wooden flooring, high ceilings and glass windows that let the light flood in, evoking the feel of a Scandanavian train station. we got matcha and black sesame latte, it exceeded my expectations. turns out this lobby was designed by [SkB architects](https://www.skbarchitects.com), people who are obsessed with designing third places. if only good design like this was the norm.

for dinner we decided on Din Tai Fung. it was underwhelming and the food was not great. but the good company made up for it.
