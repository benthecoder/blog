A few tips that [Jillian](https://jillianhess.substack.com/p/the-beatles-notes-3-ways-to-write) found after researching John and the Beatles.

### 1) Let the lyrics simmer

- Lennon first writes on scraps of paper, and move to the typewriter as it progresses
- inspiration strikes at any moment, so have a medium to capture it
- walk away from a challenging song, and come back to it later

### 2) Cut-Up the Newspaper

- "A Day in the Life" was inspired by a newspaper article, John and Paul used their imagination to break-up news stories.
- Used the [cut-up technique](https://austinkleon.com/2018/09/18/the-surprisingly-long-history-of-the-cut-up-technique/) by [Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs) to blend fact and fiction

### 3) Free-Association

- write [whatever](https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/psychologists/free-association-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work/) that comes into your head, until you get the word. George had a struggle writing lyrics for "Something".
- creative work bears a strong resemblance to play. Sometimes, it's all a matter of perspective

### Notes

- Don't be afraid to **take a break** from a project: John and Paul would come together when they're stuck on song writing; Mark Twain took year long breaks
- Use **different tools** for different writing states: ex: sketch ideas in a different font than the final form; write out ideas and type it as it takes shape
- Give **chance** a chance: free-association and cut-up techniques break us out of conventions
- make it **easy to capture ideas**: it's easy to capture them with our phones today, ex: Charlie Puth sings into voicenotes on his phone
