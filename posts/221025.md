i had chicken yakisoba from flower child for lunch again – this and the mother earth bowl are the only two things i order and have been my choice of lunch for the past 3 months. 

i've been staying at the office late into the evenings, and around 6 pm you can see the city morph into a golden landscape. with the curtain wall glass windows you can see the full view of the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bat Bridge, where a crowd will gather to see the bats. 

at the right moment, the 700 river apartment will light up, like the Eye of Sauron, monitoring me closely as i do my work. later in the day, the bright flame shifts to the 100 Congress building. i wonder which buildings light up for the people there, and if they're also noticing how the sunlight plays on concrete and glass.
