writing down and summarizing in my reMarkable is the best way to catch up on 7 lectures slides (total of ~500 pages) in one day. the last final exam i will have for 2024 started at 3pm, and ended in an hour. i left early. it was fun to do an exam without a cheatsheet, it brought me back to high school, my SPM days, when i had to memorize entire textbooks worth of information. a needle in a haystack test for 17 year olds with a mind of their own.

classmates came to our apartment first to chill. was planning my days for the break and all the tasks i can work on now that school is done. took an uber to san francisco brewing co. initial impression was great, there was free food and drinks (as long as they were below $15). i drank a few mixed drinks, and took one shot of vodka and japanese whiskey. and i was done. that was my limit. i felt the buzz, and it helped loosen me up.

the rest of the night was an experience i've never had before, and one i don't want to have again. i've never had to care for a drunk friend before. i'm lucky i had A to help me bring W home. it went from slightly funny to concerning very quick. i was worried for his life. i felt the kind of responsibility and worry a parent has to care for their children.
