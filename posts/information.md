I like consuming information a lot.

And I always push myself to [create](https://moretothat.com/release-ratio/) from what I consume, which is one of the main reasons why I'm challenging myself to write every day.

Below has been my information diet routine for the past few months.

Every morning while I'm still in bed, half-awake, I glance through the dozens of tech and finance newsletters that I barely open nowadays on [Shortwave](https://shortwave.com/), and selectively click on the ones by [TLDR](https://tldr.tech/), because they're byte-sized and easy to consume.

Then, I get up and open up YouTube on [Orion](https://browser.kagi.com/) on my iPhone 13 mini (to avoid the ads), and play videos on my feed that I find valuable and consumable in 10 minutes in the background, which actually inspired the last couple blog posts.

While I'm waiting for my oatmeal to finish cooking in the microwave, I scroll Twitter for anything intriguing, which on Twitter has been 99% about GPT wrapper side projects I wish I built, the future of LLMs, and the latest updates on [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index), and 1% webdev and memes.

Then, on my way to class I listen to podcasts, I recently discovered [The Social Radars](https://thesocialradars.captivate.fm/), where startup founders like Steve Huffman (Reddit) and Tony Xu (Doordash) share their story about how it all began, what they've learned, and what they're doing now.

Throughout the day I check HackerNews on my phone for any cool stuff, and save anything long-form to [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/), my favourite read-it-later app.

When I'm on my Macbook Air, I discover stuff through [Curius](https://curius.app/), a Chrome Extension that lets you see what your friends save and highlight on the interent. I follow a lot of smart people there (mostly UWaterloo students), and I'm finding it very valuable so far for expanding my worldview.

Before bed, I listen to [Our Daily Bread](https://odb.org/), which is my excuse for not having the time to read the Bible. It helps remind me of my faith and my values, which I have found to be important in difficult times.

I think another source of information I should consuming more is from talking other people. I've been trying to adopt a mindset of "This person knows something I don't" in social situations, and stay curious, because you can always learn something new from other people, no matter how smart you think you are.
