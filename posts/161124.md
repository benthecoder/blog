> Fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm fearsome, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. They leave that wisdom to those to whom it appeals. When the storm comes-when night falls-what's worse: the danger or the fear of danger? Give me reality, the danger itself.

mom met her college friend after 34 years. they haven't been each other since, no contact whatsoever. who will i be meeting 34 years later? who will be around the table with me? what will the world even look like then?

went to see painted ladies, arrived at the perfect time with teh purple hues in the sky, took a few photos, and left immediately because of the cold.

walked to TJ, was going to buy ingredients for green curry, but TJ does not sell green curry paste.

took a telsa model s home to their hotel, the blue one too. i've never been in one before.

took a nap, woke up super dehydrated.

ate the salty fried pork chop from chef hung's again. it doesn't taste as good as the last time. things always fail to meet your expectations of your first novel experiences, it's always the best the first time. applies to food, and other things too.

stayed a bit and chilled with family in their messy but cozy hotel room.
