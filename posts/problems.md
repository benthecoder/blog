Be [larger than the problems](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/august-31-2023) in your life.

It's easy to let the situation consume you, rattle and stress you out.

But you're suffering in your head, you're making the problem bigger than it needs to be.

Next time you face a problem, be larger than the situation.

Mentally "step outside and above it".

Acknowledge that it is a problem, and action needs to be taken.

But the chaos is happening externally, and you're still in the driver's seat internally.

You're in control of the moment, the moment is not in control of you.
