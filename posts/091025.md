flight in the early evening. i went walking around the hotel and got an acai bowl for breakfast. i found i like eating these, the sugar content is worrying though. i checked out, left my bag, and went to work out of capitol one cafe. then went to a slop bowl restaurant for lunch. it then started drizzling, lightly then it came all at once. just like malaysia. i decided to leave for the airport early and then it turned out to be an hour long instead of 20 minutes. i had a premonition perhaps. upon arrival and entering security, i was victim of an incredibly annoying flaw of the miami airport â€“ the checkpoints are segmented by concourse. which means if you went through security for concourse G, you can't enter concourse H. this was my first time having my bags and body checked twice, before i finally got to the right gate. luckily I still had time to get food for my 6 hour and 30 min journey to sf. arriving at W's house after the grueling flight, words came pouring out of my mouth. i trauma dumped for an hour or two. all the emotions and feelings pent up inside while i worked and worked.
