The conversation scene at the start of the movie The Social Network was attention-grabbing.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX4bKWhtK8M) explains why.

The idea is a two shot is impartial and does not deliver an enough of a point-of-view to convey emotion.

Instead, there's a visual rhythm of going back and forth between the two characters, where every cut is a shift in power.

And Erica is on screen more than Mark because she has control over the conversation, as she has the final word in the scene.

We feel the same tension and emotion the characters feel.

We're not just watching the conversation, we're in the conversation.
