i need to integrate more mandarin words into my life. but instead of a dopamine fulfilling app like duolingo where its faux learning, i want to learn words that i will actually use in the context of reading the bible, speaking to chinese people, or to impress T's parents.

i had this idea, where, as i find articles online, it will intelligently extract vocabulary that are out of my scope, and store it in anki for me to review.

as it feeds more from my interest and context about my life, it would be useful if the tool could find similar blogs/books/movies that use actual slang that taiwanese people use. that way it maximizes my ability to apply the words in day to day conversations.

is this the best way to learn? i do believe immersion and using the language is the fastest way, and i'm lucky to have T to practice with.
