had another dry run. i was told to try to answer this key question in my presentation: "what is the million dollar grant?" and emphasize the goal.

went to pickup the macbook in a waymo, and i spent more than 3 hours just glued to the macbook and setting it up.

i referenced eugene yan's [blog](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/mac-setup/).

also setup claude code + XCodeMCP to start building UpperRoom.

i also sold 4 items today: key chains ($5), wired apple keyboard ($5), tide pods ($15), and HP monitor ($40)

had a call with A to update him on how i'm doing. i need to do better at keeping in touch with old friends.
