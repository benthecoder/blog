- wow orthoworks is great i’m surprised a bigger orthodontist chain charges lower, which I guess makes sense, independent dentists have to charge higher to pay for the equipments, i always though it was the other way around
- the iTero scanner is so cool, the one in Ames was so tedious and uncomfortable
- those flower looking plants are called Echeveria
- 4 for $20 mix and match at Safeway jackson st, cashback + no flies + no ordering in cantonese, my cashier was cantonese tho
- Cold Nights by Ba Jin is so sad, the ending where the wife comes back and realizes the ex-husband is dead and it ends with her walking in the cold at night. the letter she wrote to him was so human, so raw and real, i like reading letters. We need to bring back the art of writing long letters
- sfpl is so cool, i can borrow 100 physical items and putting for free up to $2
- finally get to have art as therapy in my hands
- almost got a panic attack in the library, spent 5 hours here mostly studying and reviewing that it was diminishing returns
- I could technically have a mini library at home if i borrowed a ton of books
- Library is only 9 min away so it’s convenient
- I like that they have magazines too , going to read the New Yorker more
- Its a blessing to have friends to call while walking
- So worried for the first quiz, more than I’ve been for finals at Iowa, feeling like i can’t trust myself, where is my faith?
