i woke up with the worst sore throat of my life. i could barely talk. i decided to cook chicken soup with herbs. found this [recipe](https://smellylunchbox.com/chinese-herbal-chicken-soup/) online, and decided to buy chinese herbs in chinatown. i ended up spending 40 dollars on chinese herbs at Nan Hai Corporation, buying the following items:

- Chinese Dried Wild Yam (淮山 huáishān / waai4 saan1) - A nourishing herb that strengthens the spleen and stomach while boosting overall immunity, making it a foundational ingredient in traditional medicinal soups.
- Astragalus Root (黄旗/北芪 huáng qí/běi qí / wong4 kei4/bak1 kei4) - A powerful immune system booster that helps with respiratory health and provides anti-inflammatory benefits, particularly valued during cold and flu season.
- Codonopsis Root (党参 dǎng shēn / dong2 sam1) - Known as the "poor man's ginseng," this herb enhances both energy levels and digestive health while supporting immune function.
- Dried Longan (桂圓/圓肉 guìyǎn/yuánròu / jyun4 juk6) - A warming herb that improves blood circulation and boosts energy, traditionally used to combat fatigue and support overall vitality.
- Dried Jujube/Chinese Date (红枣 hóng zǎo / hong2 zao3) - A versatile herb that supports blood health, aids digestion, and promotes better sleep quality, often used as a natural sweetener in traditional remedies.
- Goji Berry/Wolfberry (枸杞 gǒuqǐ / gau2 gei2) - An antioxidant-rich berry that supports liver health and digestion while providing anti-inflammatory benefits, commonly used to maintain overall wellness.

felt tired and dizzy and hungry on the way home. i procrastinated cooking lunch because i was feeling sick and i was also trying to get my app to work, and now i'm facing the consequences. i have to learn how to "adult" better. spent an hour talking to my mom while cutting vegetables and prepping the chicken for soup, concurrently, cooking tofu with miso so i had something to eat for lunch. i left my chicken with the $13 herbs under low heat for 2 1/2 hours and watched invincible. checked it after 5 and i smelled something burning, my heart dropped. i opened the lid and all my soup was gone, only my chicken was left. learned my lesson again to always be attentive when cooking.

i realized later in the night that sore throat could be ulcer, and i realized how hard is it to not be able to talk. i've been experiencing a lot of gratitude lately, with my injury on my leg affecting my walking. this time it was my speech. i feel more grateful for the little things in life, because nothing is guaranteed.

spent the night updating results for ucsf after receiving an email from my professor and did my homework.
