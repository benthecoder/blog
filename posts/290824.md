saw a twitter [post](https://x.com/taytabb/status/1828830850638840243) last night, and decided to go to mission to get free aerogel. i'm so lucky to be in sf.

its my first time seeing and touching [aerogel](https://www.aerogel.org/). its the [world's lightest solid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeJ9q45PfD0) and can handle very high temperatures. its used by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics/aerogels-thinner-lighter-stronger/) for insulation in space suits. [making it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0HfmYBlF8g) would be a cool project.
