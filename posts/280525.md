> What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
> – Mark 8:36, NIV

went to cowork at clement st with A. we went to [Diamond Coffee n' Pastry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dWxRaZQS6y74pC9k8). i was working on homework. i can't wait for these easily ai solvable assignments to be over. my dad paid $80k for my past year in SF not for my education, but for working with UCSF. this research opened so many doors for me.

a little girl came in with his dad with glee. she was singing a tune. 5 minutes later, a homeless man came in near closing time and asked for coffee, and when denied, started to swear. and banged on the door as he left. i thought this was the nice part of SF.

i had dinner at [Pasta Supply Co](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4xxFTrMgFHtpu8eg9). they welcomed me. we talked abou the most exotic foods we've had. C drove us home and asked me about where i worked at before this. i realize i'm a one question one answer guy. i'm not usually inclined to tell people more than what's necessary. i'm not a yapper. and that is a good thing in some cases, and a weakness in others. i'm learning how to be warm and likable at the right times. i'm very selective to who i interact with, because my energy is scarce. it's a tough life being an introvert in an extroverted world.
