back to working like a machine and not having anyone to go home to. but it's okay, this is only temporary. i spent hours trying to get article generation to work locally on prod endpoint. turns out i just didn't set the right prod key. i also had to restart my laptop multiple times to stop the celery worker from erroring out. i also discovered gitlens. it's a nice way of diff-ing my branch against the master branch, so i can see just for my branch, what files i changed. great for working on a huge monorepo where there's thousands of files.
