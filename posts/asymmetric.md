Graham Weaver shares [four ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxbVGhpEkI) to live an asymmetric life.

1. Do hard things
2. Do your thing
3. Do it for decades
4. Write your story

Any change will always get worse first, then it'll get better. Doing hard things increases your baseline for discomfort. You become comfortable with discomfort.

Life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for.

There is no obstacle that will yield to you at full power for a decade or longer.

Don't linger on the past, take risks and create your own future. Don't write a story about what happened. Write your story, then make that happen.
