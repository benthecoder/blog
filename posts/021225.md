went to the domain apple store to pick up my laptop. i got a silver one this time which is nice. silver feels more timeless and bright, whereas midnight black was just too dark and would smudge easily.

before picking it up i got a bowl at whole foods, kimchi, salmon, and beans. the rest of the day was setting up everything again. this time, although still with some hiccups, was more straightforward. it feels like day 1 again, a clean slate, taking the lessons from all my past mistakes and blunders, and continuing to do my best work here.
