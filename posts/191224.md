another cafe cowork day with A. we were supposed to go saint frank coffee, the one near the google offices by the pier, but it was already 2 and it was crowded. it's hard to get out of the house these days, i'm glad just to be out at all.

went to andytown coffee in salesforce park instead. i was here once, i forgot why but i remember needing coffee. i was reading mere christianity in the queue, because it was long and i didn't want to be on my phone. biggest mistake ever.

i ordered the worst drink possible in my life. matcha plover. everything i have to avoid in a drink. carbonated. sugar. whipped cream. ice.

i couldn't finish my drink. it was devastating. matcha powder. $6.70 down the drain.

i spent the 2 hours doing ucsf work. it's been consuming me lately. it's the only thing i find worth doing. i'm learning a lot. and i'm really glad i'm involved in the projects. there are key moments in a person's career that helps set them up towards success, and i can see this internship being one of them. i just have to be more focused and efficient. and deliver results. results. that's all that matters here.

no talk about how you'e going to do something. don't ask for permission (as long as it's legal). just do it. less talk, more action.
