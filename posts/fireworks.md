Went to pier 39 with a bunch of other friends to watch the [fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks?useskin=vector) in SF today.

The show lasted approximately 22 minutes.

It wasn't anything spectacular but it was cool to watch it with a bunch of people, and being so close to fireworks.

Also thought about how interesting it is that we all gather together to watch these colorful chemical reactions in the air.

And to learn that fireworks were [invented in ancient China in 2nd century B.C.](https://www.americanpyro.com/history-of-fireworks)

And sometime during 600-900 AD a Chinese alchemist mixed potassium nitrate, sulfur and charcoal to produce the first "gunpowder".

Also cool to deep dive into the [anatomy of a fireworks](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/fireworks/anat_nf.html#break) today.
