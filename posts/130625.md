started the day with breakfast at the indian restaurant (mamak) below my apartment. they changed owners, and everything is shiny and the lights are blinding. over the years it changed a few times. just like us growing older, into different versions of our past selves, the things around us, the shops, the buildings, all grow as well.

went to watch "how to train your dragon" with my mom. a few notable moments, the father son dynamic, toothless and hiccup flying for the first time, the village accepting toothless, and the final scene where dragons are coexisting with vikings.

shopped at isetan for some food to bring back to the US. saw a church auntie here, we took a picture together like i'm a celebrity.
