Before you take on anything, pause and ask [what could be](https://thebrowser.company/values/#start)

Break apart from the daily routine and **dream** a bit.

As Toni Morrison says, <mark>"Dream, then think"</mark>

Go to different places while you dream. Pull from many places, the objective is to bring a sense of multidimensionality to what we do, and how we do it.

Asking what could be is a mindset.

DFW: "a huge percentage of the stuff I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded"

Just because something is, doesn't mean it has to be and certainly doesn't mean it's right.

It's also a practical way to crack any pre-existing beliefs you have about how a thing should or shouldn't be. The goal is to strip away any false assumptions from our thought process, this is when our creativity can truly flourish.

Murakami on _How to access Creativity_: "I have to pound the rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of creativity... I've become quite efficient, both technically and physically, at opening a hole in the hard rock and locating a new water vein.

**Ask**ing **what could be** is your chisel.
