went to tour two more apartments today. the first one was near USF. i rushed over there to be the first to tour, but ended up not liking it because it was far and not a great space. the other one was a nice location, but something didn't feel right. something was preventing me from signing these houses. (foreshadowing)

we walked around clement street, and went to some grocery stores

few things that caught my eye at the park life gift shop

- school of life books
- secret language of flowers (jean-michel othoniel)
- the emotional support toolkit

bought roast pork from a store for 20 dollars.

went in to green apple books.

- cats and the meaning of life
- the philosophy of walking
