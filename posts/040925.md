in between resolving PRs to clean up my code and getting stuff done, i chat with claude to learn about american healthcare. concepts like revenue cycle management, health information exchange, and prior authorization. there is so much i'm ignorant about, and i found without knowledge about what once was, and how it came to be, i'm unable to appreciate what i have. and on the same note, instead of complaining american healthcare sucks and malaysia is better, i want to know more about why and how it happened, so i can actually back that claim instead of just speaking the obvious. there is so much to learn, i wish i had an AI that builds daily bite-sized lessons and spaced repetition for interesting topics i want to dive into.

rebasing confuses me still, git intimidates me, i'm worried one wrong command and i lose all my work or the very least, embarrassing myself with a silly mistake. which is a fear i have to overcome if i want to learn and operate fast.
