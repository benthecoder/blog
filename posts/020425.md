TIL about [cross encoders](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/sentence_embeddings2/) and [colbert](https://huggingface.co/colbert-ir/colbertv2.0) while reading about to introduce joint attention between query and candidates to prepare for my interview.

Cross Encoders:

- process query and document pairs together through a single transformer
- compute relevance scores directly without creating separate embeddings
- highly accurate but computationally expensive for large document collections
- cannot pre-compute document representations, requiring full processing for each query
- use case: re-ranking top-k search results from a first-pass retrieval system

ColBERT:

- uses late interaction architecture with separate encodings for queries and documents
- creates contextualized embeddings for **each token** rather than a single vector
- performs efficient token-level interactions between query and document representations
- enables both pre-computation of document representations and fast retrieval
- use case: semantic search over millions of documents with better accuracy than bi-encoders
