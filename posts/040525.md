agency

- [School is Not Enough - by Simon Sarris](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/school-is-not-enough)
  > it [programming] has a low bar to entry and is something that parents still allow their children to “work at” do despite the hour-demands of systematized schooling. It is one of the few industries with an immensely permissionless culture
  >
  > The purpose of education is to develop agency within a child. Purposeful work and achieving mastery are tools to getting there. They aren’t the results of learning and imagination, it’s the other way around—learning is simply the consequence of doing.
- [Jon-Kyle / Unschooling and Building with AI](https://www.jon-kyle.com/log/unschooling-ai)
  > I’ve always been a generalist. Design was the gateway—making visual things. Making things interactive lead to a technical proficiency and learning how to program. This is now called “design engineering,” but the motivation was to do whatever necessary to see an idea through from conception to completion
  >
  > Not thinking along discipline, but intuitively doing what is needed to see a project through, is the direct result of my schooling experience
  >
  > There is a misconception that the primary affordance of AI is increasing velocity. Of speeding up arriving at an output. In a sense this is true, in the same way a pencil speeds up your ability to make a legible mark on paper. But it is also a remarkable learning tool. You can ask limitless numbers of questions to satisfy your curiosity without, well, driving it nuts

build

- [Impact, agency, and taste | benkuhn.net](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/)
  - work backwards from the root goal, figure out a better way to accomplish things
  - be someone who is trusted to make something inevitable
  - good taste sign: "what does it seem like everyone else is mysteriously bad at?"
  - taste is also the "quality of your predictive models and search heuristics"
    - to improve, just try it
    - spend [more thinking time](https://www.benkuhn.net/thinkrealhard/) on what to work on and on self-reflection
  - metacognition: reflect on your own (and your team's) work and thought processes, and figure out how to improve them.

create

- [The Creative Process](https://openspaceofdemocracy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/baldwin-creative-process.pdf)
  > A society must assume that it is stable, but the artist must know, and he must let us know, that there is nothing stable under heaven

- [21 observations from people watching - by shani](https://skincontact.substack.com/p/21-observations-from-people-watching)
  > Polite has a mechanical quality to it, like carrying out all the right movements to replace batteries in a remote. Happy has a boundless quality: unpredictable, even when it is at a low level. There is an openness, allowing another person to surprise and delight them.
