today is A's farewell party. we rushed one of the assignments for school, and took a lyft to bayside village. we were an hour late, but that didn't matter. everyone was playing poker. we joined in for a few games, but our hands weren't good. we didn't want to buy in too much. they had a cake for A, and people were talking in their own circles. its nice to have a bunch of friends together.

i spent the rest of the night finishing up my contrary report on OE. slept 3:40 am
