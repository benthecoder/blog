6 [wording tweaks](https://careercutler.substack.com/p/6-tiny-wording-tweaks-to-level-up) to level up your communication, can by applied to all situations.

1. "Can you" -> "Would you be open to"
   - a connection to a sense of open-mindedness, people consider themselves "open-minded"
2. Add "because" to any request
   - Social psychologist Ellen Langer [experiment](https://execvision.io/blog/power-because/): request-plus-reason results in 94% of people letting her skip ahead in line; without reason, only 60%
3. "Can you" -> "Can we"
   - gives collaborative feeling, comes off less commanding
4. "What do you think" at the end of suggestions
   - allows you to explain what you think is best, while leaving discussion open
5. "It seems like" for stalemates in conversations
   - in Never Split the difference by Chris Voss, there's a concept called labeling
   - ex: "it seems like it would be impossible to make this change ..."
   - **labelling a negative diffuses a negative**
   - negative = "it would be impossible", labelling it causes the other person to disagree with that.
   - it can move forward a conversation, where the other person might say "Well, no. It's not impossible. We could probably do..."
6. Change order of "but"
   - take these two statements
     - 1\) "I see what you're saying, **but** in my experience, the other way has worked best"
     - 2\) "In my experience, the other way has worked best, **but** I see what you're saying"
     - 1\) negates the other person, while 2\) negates yourself. To give a collaborative vibe, go for 2\), as 1\) risks getting them defensive
     - alternative is to swap but -> "at the same time"

These tiny tweaks can go a long way for you to communicate effectively, be someone that's nice to work with, and create a collaborative environment.
