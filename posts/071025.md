finding it hard to reach out to people and ask for help when everyone is busy with their own projects. also finding it hard to communicate and chat with people around me because i'm not that familiar with the language and culture yet. i can feel my brain constantly going, you should participate in this convo, but what should i say, should i say it now? if i say it would i be weird? i'm already new, do i want this to be their impression of me? my overthinking muscle goes hyperactive and i just end up wanting to stick my head under the ground. i am an awkward boy. i'm still learning to accept that fact, and also be more confident in taking little stabs at conversing and making jokes. it is an art. i'm practicing imitation learning 24/7.
