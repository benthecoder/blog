the past month i've let claude do most of my thinking. it is a jetpack for my thoughts.

i use it for:

- generating quiz questions
- researching papers
- coding on cursor
- translating traditional chinese
- bill splitting
- generating hackathon ideas
- ...

it's an endless list.

i have to be careful to not be too dependent on it, but it's making me so much more efficient and productive.

i'm living in great times.

i have to figure out how to utilize >8k credits before they expire in a year. i have to keep building. it's a muscle. i haven't made anything useful yet. i aim to do that in 2025. even just 10 users would be enough. one paying user. that's the baseline.
