to write well you need to read good writing.

a few good books: east of eden, secret history, stoner, any book from stripe press

i toured an apartment with 188 8th avenue, it has three 8s, which is a good number in chinese culture, because the number 8 in cantonese is "baat" 八, which sounds similar to "faat" (發), meaning prosperity and wealth in cantonese.

it's also a a single unit with no one above or below, and is one block from clement st. it was the perfect place. after the tour i immediately wanted to sign the lease. but i went to get lunch first, one of teh stores had the three dish for 8 bucks deal too. i was thinking how i could come here often for food, just like back in chinatown. afer that i went to find a library to finish up the lease, i took a while, submitted it at 4 something. but someone else submitted at the same time.

then i went with wei to tour his apartment. it's somewhere in mission. we're both going to different places.
