[Self monitoring](https://cppastudents.medium.com/time-management-the-importance-of-self-monitoring-c9dfff241af1) is the idea of tracking some sort of progress on your goal, say number of times you did activity X or amount of time spent on task Y.

[Research](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/bul0000025) shows people who [self-monitor](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tl.37219956305) are [more likely](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220973.1996.9943798) to [reach their goals](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-0663.77.6.623).

I had the idea of using my browser history to track my daily activity. It would be a simple SQL query that gets the latest day, and then have GPT-4 make sense of the data.

Most days I feel like I barely accomplish anything.

My days only really start after lunch, and I do most of my work from 4 till 6 p.m., and then from 10 p.m. till 2 a.m.

I would love a tool that can seamlessly track when I'm in flow, and when I'm procrastinating and doing trivial work.

I also time block tasks on my calendar, but I rarely actually follow the schedule.

Maybe I just require more discipline. Or be more realistic with my time estimates and energy levels.

I should start journalling what I've done everyday. I think that would be a good start.
