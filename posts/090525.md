i was lethargic again today. i had two meetings today. one with hp about my ambassador tasks and my hardware stuck in malaysia. the second was with nvidia for the event J wants to organize for women.

i fell into a deep tiredness that i was unable to escape from. i kept dozing off. i could barely move my arms. after eating porridge and stir fried pork belly and lady fingers cooked by my sister, i eventually gave in and fell asleep on the floor bed.

when i woke up i got enough energy to accompany my sister to the pier. all she wanted was to see the sea lions. we first stopped at the willion stout architecture bookstore. the sun was scorching, and i wish i wore my hat and sunglasses. it was windy at the pier, i acted as the photographer for sister. we watched a magic show performance, we saw an old man on a unicycle juggling, playing an electric guitar. i'm only 23 and i don't have half his energy.

we took tram home. it was a nice day. i felt tired again at night.
