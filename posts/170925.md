tried out the tuna poke bowl from local foods, and ordered the beautiful matcha latte, with probiotic and ashwagandha, which is a shrub that is anti-inflammatory and can improve cognitive functions and reduce stress. something i need immensely.

also had issues with django where i kept hitting an issue with an old migration file. turns out it was a red herring and i just had different fields from my migration file. i really need to check the details more before jumping to conclusions. it's also so hard to get people to help you review stuff, and having the anxiety of not knowing when they can get around to your stuff, with people towering over you telling you to get things done quickly.

also bought the apple airpods max and iphone 17. both blue.
