I started my internship with Top Golf and ended it with Top Golf.

I also played bowling today.

It's fun watching [pros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tyKvfRO9Ok) [excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5nnDbV0znE) at their sport.

The two sports are very different, one is hitting the ball and the other is throwing it.

But they share similarities in good form.

There's so much training and dedication that you don't see.

All you see is the perfect form and you feel so incompetent among them.

I don't like the feeling of being a beginner, it feels like climbing a steep mountain while other people are at the top enjoying the view.

But being comfortable with sucking is a good sign that you're trying new things and growing. It's always good to step out of your comfort zone, and suck at things.
