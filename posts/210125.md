i have three classes this module, distributed 2 (airflow), advanced ml, and time series.

i paid full attention in the advanced ML class. SVD was taught. it's increasingly important to know this well. i'm seeing this concept pop up a lot of times while researching. it's so important to understand the basic concepts. or you won't appreciate how it can be applied to other situations, like creating [self-adaptive LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252).

continued to struggled with research. using deepseek as a thinking partner, was still using softmax loss at this point. writign this a week after, it's interesting to see the points where i got stuck, and what i did to get out, and how sometimes you just have to keep trying things. just do what is required, not what is best.
