i woke up at 3 p.m. i've never slept so much before.

for dinner i got the secret shredded chicken from HK milk tea on stockton. it came in a huge plate. i like how fragant the peanutes are. and the chicken with yellow skin (which is from the sesame oil)

was a few minutes late to practice at 7:30 p.m., and i had to practice for 2 hours which was exhausting. and i had to learn all the songs on teh spot and endure the embarassment of not playing the intros well. but all this is for God.

finally finished the contrary and went to sleep at 3 again.
