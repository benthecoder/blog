i drove a zipcar (toyota corolla) to SFO with A to pick up my parents. i haven't driven in over 6 months, things were smooth, but i missed the arrival gate entrance, and stopped at the departure gate instead. A left and my parents got on. i figured since we had about 40 mins left, we could go to the costco nearby. but little did i know traffic was terrible at 4 pm in SF, so i extended 30 minutes on the meter, and i paid 55 in total for ~2.5 hours.

it's interesting to see my parents here again. grateful for them and their support for my education. i find it hard to appreciate how privileged i am for being able to live in sf and study here at a private school. did i fully make use of my time here? did i maximize agency? looking back, i was tired a lot, and my self-confidence took a hit from my interviews with FAANG. but i'm now constantly considering what i truly want. and it's hard to do so when my life is so intermixed with expectations and desires influenced by the people in my life

i looked into [Open Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPOZ1nA2RIw) more and it's insane how they $107M funding, $75M from Sequoia in their series A. i want to work for this company. their models score >90% on USMLE. i wonder if they would release an API. i'll write about them for contrary next.
