took the morning to prepare for the CA DMV driving online test. i answered somewhere around 200-300 questions in total, before i decided to take it just 35 minutes before the exam window closes at 4pm.

i felt more anxiety that i did in my exams at usf, because i answered 5 questions wrong (i was keeping track in my head), and i was not given a progress bar, so i was full on panicking that i would fail. and at some point i lost count. it's an interesting system, i only knew i pass about 10 minutes after i took the test in an email.

walked to safeway feeling afraid of the outside world after being cooped up at home for so long.

i get my usual: two planet oat unsweetened oat milk $3.5 each for my protein shakes, natural harvest wheat bread for my breakfast, and kinders seasoning on a whim because they were on a BOGO promo, i saved 11 dollars. felt good about that.

last year, this time, i was in seattle in a nice 3-level apartment with my family. i miss my family.
