i spent the morning finishing my contrary report. had a chat with R about OE. feeling convicted and excited about the possibility. today J was treating us to vegetarian japanese cuisine for helping her with her interviews. i ordered the bamboo shroots ramen and it was kinda sour. it also needed more protein, i wanted tofu in it at least.

after dinner just the boys walked around and we saw art at the drawing room: annex.pretty art from grade 10 to 12. we stopped at jakes steaks for fries. we all felt hungry and went to echigo home cook for curry, the "fine japanese food" was truly fine.
