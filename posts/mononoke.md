> “You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.”

I watched Princess Mononoke again today.

I remember seeing it when I was younger, and some of the scenes were really familiar as I was rewatching.

Like the black worms, the blue forest spirit at night, and the princess of course, but I do not remember the blood and gore from the fight scenes.

It was such a [beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We-TUXA03wQ) movie with a great [writing about humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWZmIHHjKM), it's a [masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UB-zel_uHg) about the balance of nature and humanity, and the good and evil in both.

The part that stuck with me the most is to see with unclouded eyes, to understand that the world isn't inherently good or evil, to look at things from both sides, and make decisions without prejudice.

I was also curious about the mythology and history behind the characters, and found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f53ZCld72FI) diving into them.

I also found that it inspired Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which I now want to play.
