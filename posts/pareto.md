The [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle?useskin=vector): 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.

The 80/20 rule can be observed in the real-world.

Business management: 80% of sales come from 20% of clients.

Economics: 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population

Fundraising: 20% of the donors contributing towards 80% of the total.

Computer science: [Microsoft](https://www.crn.com/news/security/18821726/microsofts-ceo-80-20-rule-applies-to-bugs-not-just-features.htm) found that fixing top 20% of bugs, 80% of crashes will be eliminated

We can also apply it to our lives.

**Relationships**: who are the few people that matter the most and has the most impact on my life, spend more time with them.

**Actions**: What are a few actions I can take today that can have the most impact on my life?

**Stress**: What are the stressors that cause the most friction in my life? Eliminate them.

**Learning**: What are the few high-value sources of information that I should focus on to help me grow and self-actualize?
