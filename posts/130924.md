couldn't solve normalization questions in db class and not studying was a huge mistake. went to stats class and found out i did i felt even more insecurity. i am heavily underestimating the amount of work i need to put in for these classes.

got an interview request with meta on wed. the next 4 days is going to be a grind. this week was so overwhelming that it really felt i'm barely staying afloat. as someone who struggles with major anxiety, pairing exams with interviews is a nightmare.

but i have time. i have a plan. i just need to prepare and practice. i need to have faith. i need to do my best. if it's what God wants for me, then it'll happen. if not, then I'll be okay. as long as i did my part.
