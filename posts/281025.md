i woke up with acai bowls that T bought for us. i've been obsessed with acai bowls recently, even though they might be chock-full of sugar. we got k food for lunch, i got to experience korean beef noodle soup, a delicacy that is rare in atx.

we went to get sushi for dinner and i sent a picture of the menu to claude to get recommendations. i tweaked it a bit but had full faith in claude's taste. i liked the sea bream and the bass, i did not like the shrimp.

at night i was surprised with a cake that T made herself, sugar and dairy free, the best combination of words for me.

we kept working for the rest of the night.

i don't have a 24 things i learned at 24 this time, but only one reflection, which is there's no greater blessing than to have someone to share your life with, and to have the opportunity to work on something impactful and get paid for it. it is a rare combination that i somehow stumbled upon seemingly by accident, but looking back, it was a collection of decisions and experiences that got me to where i am today. and i only look forward, continuously seeking to live with more courage and with more passion for the things i believe in and to give attention to the people i care about.
