woke up at 5:15 am, so early i was completely immobilized, T helped wake me up. being up this early, i was so cold i was shivering. i had to turn on the space heater. stood in the kitchen getting warmed up for an hour while talking to T. got there at 7:06 am and started helping with decorations. everyone was frantically trying to put everything up, whatever that was red, it went up the walls.

we rushed the slides until the very last minute at 10:10 before presenting. miss chinatown was there and gave a great speech. we sped through everything, and after the presentations, we all loosened a little, but still on our toes. we moved from one thing to the next, first the red bull, then the Tesla trucks, then the lunch from chinatown, then the boba, then it was the judging sheet and prize planning.

in between the chaos, we got to hear the joys of students having a great time, being impressed and shocked by how cracked these kids are, petting the cutest corgi ever and giving her a massage, it feels surreal, the past 2 months we all kept trying to get kids, and now they're all here.

stayed till 6:45pm and cleared everything up. tomorrow is another battle again, then we go back to our normal lives.
