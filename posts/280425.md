i finally saw a primary care at ucsf health primary care on hayes and i went to ask for two things, referral for my labral tear and for a GI. i was referred, but that doesn't mean anything yet. they gave me two pieces of paper, one which stated i should call a number for a GI, and the other was just for reference, i had to find my own PT provider that is in-network.

so i called the number for the GI, and they said the earliest next appointment was september 23rd. september. that's an entire 5 months of wait, just to even get a consultation. i felt frustrated.

for PT, i called the ucsf center at mt zion, and their earliest was may 29th. not too bad, but that was just a video consultation. to actually start PT, that would be 2 weeks after that. and that's the middle of june. two more weeks and i finish school and i have no more school insurance.

i have to go home to malaysia now while i'm still a student. all the odds are against me from seeing a specialist in sf in time. the ironic thing is i intern at UCSF health.
