[Simone Stolzoff](https://x.com/SimoneStolzoff) said journalists always asks four questions when considering a pitch:

1. What's the story?
2. Why should people care?
3. Why are you the person who should be writing it?
4. Why is now the time to write it?

You can apply this pitch to your own life and the things you work on:

1. What's the task?
1. Why should I care?
1. Am I the person who should be doing it?
1. Why is now the right time to do it?
