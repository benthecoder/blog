> “I feel like in some ways, you can only feel absence if you really appreciate presence and vice versa. And if you don’t really appreciate presence, then absence is not gonna hit you as hard.. I think it makes you attend to spaces and time itself.” - Kogonada (Slant Magazine, 2017)

we didn't win, but it was a good reminder and lesson. mistakes: not going through what the platform can do, trying to code things from scratch, not using openai tts from the start to stream audio since assemblyai is paid, using langchain, not talking to more people about the idea, not researching what's already out there (gpt4o released the same thing 10 months ago to Be My Eyes), and we built a version of it that's rough on the edges. but it was a good time, i got closer with my friends, and it's a good reminder that things don't always go how you expect, and it's humbling and rewarding to see better projects being built, so that my level of taste keeps growing. chef hung for dinner. amazing food.
