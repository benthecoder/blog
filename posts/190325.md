stood at booth for 3 and a half hours at hp talking about ai studio, spoke too much my throat starting hurting. the people who came over were a wide spectrum, from people looking uninterested to people who were captivated by the software. there's a quality that the product and sales people have that i was missing, it's how they tell the story. they don't just talk about what it is, they talk about why you need it. that was hard for me to replicate.

went to the influencer event, chatted with the hs students. red wine is a good drink to open up and chat more. met two HP ml engineers working on hp conferencing. the rest of the night were photos, listening to people talking, and having a good time.
