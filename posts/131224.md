last night made me groggy and tired the whole day. my entire body just didn't feel right. watched heretic on my hp laptop. i believe doubt is an essential part of faith. doubt is the beginning of true faith. my fellowship group talked about science and religion, and how they can coexist. i was the type to not dig too deep, afraid of what i might find, worried that doubt might corrupt my faith. but that stifles faith, i should not be afraid to seek answers, the only danger is in the absolutes, to only see one side of things. i have a lot to learn still. mere christianity is a good place to start. my goal is to finish that book before 2025.

quick thoughts on heretic: i'm a fan of hugh grant, it's fun to watch him play a villain. some things that he said in the movie did strike a chord, it got me curious. i don't have enough context or knowledge to critique his monopoly analogy. if i got into a debate with someone like him, i can't see myself perform well. how strong is my faith? how can i stand strong against attacks like his? i have a lot of room to grow.
