i got to work out of the cambridge office. the same place where i had a call with R about my interest in joining oe. full circle. it's nice to work with more people at the company. and seeing the oe shirts, magazine, books, wall art, and retired tech appliances from ex employoees that tell a story of the company's growth over the years. i'm standing on the rubble of many past failures and successes, on the shoulders of some of the smartest engineers and scientists i've had the privilege to meet. im in a constant state of anxiety and excitement, unable to tell them apart. 

i volunteered for a project that came from the big Cs, and the rest of the night (and morning) felt like an intense solo hackathon, where completion mattered more than winning. the stakes felt high at the time. as the hours passed from 1 to 2am, then 3, and suddenly 6 am, i retired to bed, greeted by amber sunrise.
