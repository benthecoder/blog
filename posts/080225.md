![Chinatown Hacks posters](/images/chinatownhacks_posters.jpeg)

spent the day with mafia and j walking around chinatown and promoting the hackathon, it was humbling, embarassing, yet fun to go out of my comfort zone to talk to strangers on the streets. i respect the youtubers who do those interviews walking up to people, it takes a lot of courage. i realze i'm also not friendly enough, and when i talk to strangers i think too much about what to say and how i'm saying it, rather than focusing on the person i'm talking to, their facial expression, and how to adapt to that. but it was a fruitful day, i got to try different kinds of tea, blue people tea (ginseng) and blue tea (for menopause), and lychee tea (a beginner tea for kids). i tried out a new restaurant, and i got to practice how to actually talk to people. i'm in my head so much that i still don't know how to respond or react to what people say. steamed my kabocha squash, my pot is still burnt from the curry, the steam smelled burnt. the price of one hasty decision is high, i learned it's almost always not worth it to do things faster for convenience. spent the rest of the night making the posters, applying to a GenAI engineer for health job by apple, and cleaning up my safari tabs for tomorrow's sunday links.
