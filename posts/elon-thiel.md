The best co-founder duo is a combination of:

1. a **realist** who constantly thinks about how to **reduce business risk**.
2. an **optimist** who constantly **dreams of an ambitious future**.

Example: Elon Musk & Peter Thiel

During Elon's PayPal days, he was into [amplifying risk](https://sameerbajaj.com/musk/).

Entrepreneurs are risk mitigators, and try to figure out controllable variables and minimize risk.

But Elon liked to "floor it and see how fast it goes"

This made him fundamentally different from Thiel, who always focused on limiting risk.

His risk addiction can be useful for driving people to do what seems to be impossible.

> "He's amazingly successful getting people to march across a desert. "He has a level of certainty that causes him to put all of his chips on the table"
