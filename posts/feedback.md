To receive for constructive and effective feedback, you need to ask for it.

A [framework](https://hellojames.co.uk/writing/better-feedback/) by James is the 30% vs 90% feedback.

When you're **30% done**, you're confirming the direction.

Ask your audience: "Are we on the right track?"

Seek for the following:

- does it makes sense?
- first impression of concept
- if it meets business needs
- suggestions for other involvement
- if everyone is in agreement
- high-level insights
- challenges to scope
- proceed/abandon

When you're **90% done**, everyone should be aligned, you want to sweat every tine detail.

Ask your audience: "Is there anything we've missed?"

seek for the following:

- typos and bad grammar
- jargon or excluding language
- inappropriate tone or emotion
- ambiguous messaging
- confusing information or structure
- layout or formatting problems
- unclear call to actions
- inconsistencies (i.e. visual)
- performance issues

When requesting input, tell people **how far along** you are, and what you'd like feedback on.

A more detailed version:

- 5%: do we agree on the problem we think we're solving?
- 30%: are we on the right track?
- 60%: is this solution sound, will we meet our goals?
- 90%: is there anything we missed?
- 100%: what we learned / try different next time?
