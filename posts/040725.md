today is 4th of july. but i stayed home the ENTIRE day. i started building medai, a hugging face daily papers but for medical papers. i wanted to build it for the job talk, but i kept facing issues.

two good blogs on the role of chatting in AI interfaces

- [Chat Interfaces & Declaring Intent](https://lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?2085)
- [The Receding Role of AI Chat](https://lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?2105)

and watched these two videos

- [Nils Reimers - Introduction to Embeddings & Retrieval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skj-d78j4YM)
- [Information Theory for Language Models: Jack Morris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWIKyLSUBIc)

W went to get an air purifier at a good value all teh way down to fremont. i wanted to stay back to study, but ultimately i should have just went. i didn't get any interview studying done at all.

i saw the fireworks play out through my window. i recall how the past two years i watched these fireworks with friends. this time i live in SF, and i'm home. maybe that's the true sign of being an SF resident, you don't go to these crowded events anymore. you'd rather just stay home.
