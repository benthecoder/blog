i went to church, had a quick conversation with auntie S, who's always warm and happy to see me back in sf. i asked auntie S about her son, and she shared she will be returning to taiwan. she never forgets to remind me that going to church is important, it's central to shaping your identity and values as a christian.

then i took a short visit to city lights bookstore, my favorite bookstore. a few books caught my attention: amazing grace: a cultural history of the beloved hymn, maker of patterns by freeman dyson, and the shakespeare and company book of interviews.

i picked up fish porridge for lunch and decided to have it at W's house before leaving for the airport. this time i made sure to arrive earlier since i was checking in a bag. i packed everything back this time, my last few items that i left at his house. it feels like i've finally moved to austin for real. my belongings have left sf too. feels like there's no part of me left in sf.

the flight experience upon arriving in austin was not great. i waited 45 min in taxiing and another 30 min more for baggage. it was already 12:30 a.m. i was exhausted. i was thinking about how there were so few chairs in this airport, and why it was so cramped. why is austin's airport is so small and so badly designed, whereas other airports like changi airport are just excellent.
