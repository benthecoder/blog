today i finally replaced my expired CA license, which i've been using for domestic flights even though the expiry date is june 27, 2025. the process wasn't bad. i waited about an hour and a half, which was decent compared to past experiences, perhaps because it wasn't the DMV but the texas department of public safety. i made an appointment online and checked in 30 minutes prior. when i arrived, i asked a worker what forms i needed, filled them out, and got my license switched. all for just 30 bucks. it's timely because the roadtrip starts tomorrow, and i have to help chip in with driving.
