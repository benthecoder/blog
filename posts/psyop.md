The story you tell yourself matters.

If you tell yourself that you're energetic, you become more energetic.

If you tell yourself you're depressed, you become depressed.

Our beliefs shape who we become.

If you want to be more confident and outgoing, think about someone who's confident.

Then tell yourself you're that person.

You will become that person.

There's nothing holding you back from developing your desired traits besides yourself.
