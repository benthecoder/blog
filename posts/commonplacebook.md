![A commonplace book from the mid-seventeenth century](/images/commonplace.jpg)

I learned about the idea of [commonplace books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book?useskin=vector) today, which is a way to compile knowledge. These books are similar to scrapbooks where you would fill items of many kinds: notes, proverbs, adages, maxims, quotes, letters, poems, prayers, recipes, etc.

Henry wrote a blog sharing [35 pieces of wisdom](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/35-pieces-of-practical-wisdom-from) from his commonplace book.

I thought of collecting some of them that resonate with me here, and have this blog be my commonplace book, a place to collect items of many kinds.
