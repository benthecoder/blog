In Peter Thiel's book, [Zero to One](https://youexec.com/book-summaries/zero-to-one-by-peter-thiel-and-blake-masters), he outlines 7 questions that every startup must answer before it can be confident in its potential for future revenues and growth.

1. The **Engineering** question: "Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?"
2. The **Timing** question: "Is now the right time to start your particular business?"
3. The **Monopoly** question: "Are you starting with a big share of a small market?"
4. The **People** question: "Do you have the right team?"
5. The **Distribution** question: "Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?"
6. The **Durability** question: "Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?"
7. The **Secret** question: "Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?"
