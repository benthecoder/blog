> what are you? To define is to limit

Reading 501 Great Writers: A Comprehensive Guide to the Giants of Literature. so many great writers. philosophers, artists, poets, novelists, politicians.

A few that caught my eye:

“pride, envy, avarice – these sparks have set on fire the hearts of al men” – Inferno, VI

Emerson in “Self-reliance” exhorts everyone to pay attention to their own “inner laws” ahead of societal expectation or religious beliefs. It is the individual, rather than the institution, which is truly sacred. “Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist”

Memoriam A.H.H

> I hold it true, whate'er befall;
> I feel it, when I sorrow most;
> 'Tis better to have loved and los
> Than never to have loved at all.

The Cost of Living by Deborah Levy

> we either die of the past or we become an artist.

> Ideas come to us as the successors to griefs, and griefs, at the moment when they change into ideas, lose some part of their power to injure the heart; the transformation itself, even, for an instant, releases suddenly a little joy. – Proust, Du côté de chez Swann

> writing was one of the few activities in which I could handle the anxiety of uncertainty, of not knowing what was going to happen next
