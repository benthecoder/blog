![The Fool (tarot card)](/images/fool.jpg)

[Ella Luna](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/elle-luna/), a designer/artist/soul searcher walked up to the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick and said the Uber app sucked. And told him three things she would do to fix it. "Redo the logo, redo the entire app, and change the rating system". He took her up on it, flew in two designers outside of Uber, and together, they redesigned it in three weeks, and it won the Fast Company 2013 Innovation by Design Awards for the transportation category.

The moral of the story here is that everyone wants to be the best version of themselves, build a successful business, be something, do something. [Most people won't](https://bryce.vc/post/64889707700/most-people-wont).

But once in a while someone takes a leap of faith and puts themselves out there. They may face rejection or failure or worse, but they come out the other side. Better. Changed. Boulder.
