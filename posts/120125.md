> “Attention, taken to its highest degree, is the same thing as prayer. It presupposes love and faith. Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer.” – Simone Weil

1. [consumed.today](https://consumed.today)
   - i love this concept of keeping track your digital (audio, text, video) and physical diet. the audio effects are a nice touch.
2. [Create every day](https://jihad.house/notes/create-every-day/) by jihad
   - "consistency breeds taste. taste breeds outcome"
   - the single most important thing is to consistently create.
3. [Unsolicited blogging advice](https://manuelmoreale.com/unsolicited-blogging-advice) by Manu
   - good for anyone who's thinking about starting a blog, or those struggling to keep blogging. "just put stuff out there" document random thoughts, nuggets you found. be yourself. be authentic.
4. [Friends and relationships](https://santiaranguri.com/friends/?curius=30) by santi aranguri
   - some interesting thoughts about how to make (weird) friends and advice for having a social life.
   - "sometimes we should follow our emotions over logic; doesn't mean that logic was wrong. what was wrong was to assign a logic a role that is best fulfilled by emotions, what was wrong was to think that logic is more powerful that it really is."
   - and "Loyalty as the most important trait in a friend"
5. [What is Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127203824/https://www.jidp.or.jp/en/about/firsttime/whatsdesign) by Japan Institute of Design Promotion (JDP)
   - what is design? JDP's answer is "people".
     - the central concern when a designer plans something new is people. the designer asks "what do people need? what should i design for them? this is the core of design.
     - design consists of a series of processes of thinking constantly about people, identifying objectives, and planning ways to achieve them.
   - products vs services? product is a means of achieving a service, and a service is an objective.
     - i.e. Walkman is a portable music player as a product, but the service is allowing users to listen to music while walking around
     - JDP believes designers design both the product and the service, using the product as a means of designing the service
   - design vs engineering?
     - i.e. NANOPASS 33, a hypodermic needle for insulin injection that won the Good Design Grand Award in 2005
     - since the ultimate objective beyond the pain-free concept is **the user**, it can be described as a design.
     - if the goal was a CPU that delivers 1.25x the processing speed than the previous model, it does not quality as design, since the sole objective is to increase speed.
6. How to get good at anything creative by [Koos](https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/get-good-at-anything-creative)
   - make practice part of what you do (make web interface for your ML model to practice design)
   - "we are most productive when we concentrate on a very small number of projects to which we can devote a great deal of attention"
   - high speed = more reps and iterations = getting to final results quick
   - understand tradition, copying can be useful, it's very hard to copy well-made creations, and even harder to improve them while doing so
7. [Ai2 Climate Emulator](https://allenai.org/blog/ai2-climate-emulator)
   - how can AI help with climate change? by replacing/augmenting physics-based computer models to accurately forecast and simulate to inform planning, i.e. predicting disruptive extreme events, which can save thousands.
   - adapting AI weather models has three fundamental challenges: 1\) stability and 2\) accuracy across a range of climates, and 3\) coupling physics-based models of ocean, ice and land.
   - ACE2 is the world's first climate emulator accurate for climate variability and climate change (addressing #1 and #2), and can be coupled to a simple slab [ocean model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04418). the next goal is to couple to a realistic AI ocean emulator that can simulate near-surface currents and ocean temperatures, and the slow uptake of heat into the deep ocean

read

- pg 33 into confessions, tolstoy is feeling the emptiness of everything and is contemplating suicide because of his fear of death and the inevitability of it all. it's comforting reading this because i've had similar thoughts, and knowing that someone like Tolstoy felt the same way feels like i'm not alone. i'm only 1/3 in and i think he finds God in the process? i believe it will help in my own spiritual journey.

watched

- interstellar (my 3rd watch probably, forgot a lot of the details. i like how every watch you notice different things, and feel different emotions)
- constantine (i was super hooked into this movie, it feels so much like the matrix but with demons instead and not AI)
