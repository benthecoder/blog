Charlie Munger famously said this about [inversion](https://fs.blog/inversion/)

> "All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there."

This was inspired by German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi who often solved difficult problems following a simple strategy:

> "man muss immer umkehren" (or loosely translated, "invert, always invert.")

Inversion forces you to **uncover hidden beliefs** about the problems you're trying to solve.

It improves your understanding of a problem by forcing you to do the [work necessary to have an opinion](https://fs.blog/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/) as you're forced to consider different perspectives.

To practice inversion, <mark>spend time thinking about the opposite of what you want</mark>, and avoid all the things that could lead to that happening. i.e. work your way backwards in any problem.

Or to put it more simply, <mark>spend less time trying to be brilliant and more time trying to avoid obvious stupidity</mark>

a few examples

- hosting an event: how would your guests have the worst possible time
- shipping a new feature: how will the launch fail?
- picking up a new habit: what obstacles prevent me from ever adopting this habit?
- learning a new skill: how will I ensure I never gain proficiency?
- a job interview: how will I give the worst possible impression / answer to important questions?
- happiness: how can I stay miserable?
- anything at all: how will I fail?
