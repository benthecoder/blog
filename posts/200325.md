lunch was shitake and tofu and yellow curry. i was prepping for the linkedin recruiter call the entire morning that i had to miss my shift at hp.

after the call, and learning about the amount of leetcode and ML involved, i started stressing out. i kept stress eating free popcorn from gtc park. i ended up not have appetite to eat dinner, the $20 chicken salad sold at the hotel.

i had to rush to judge the world's shortest hackathon judging at 8:45 pm, the projects i came across were okay. their judging process was fun to watch. it's interesting to hear their thoughts and how they come to a conclusion about the winners. the judging sheet was there just for vibes.

i felt severe insecurity the rest of the night, possibly the jitters from the upcoming interview, i felt overwhelmed and numbed.
