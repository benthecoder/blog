my dad asked chatgpt for churches in austin, and it recommended christian life church. they had four services that go as late as 1 p.m. so we decided to go for the 11:30 one. to make use of time, we first went to uncommon objects for a bit of antique shopping, an activity my mom loves.

when we got to christian life church, we were welcomed with open arms. they told us about 6000 people attend across all services. when we stepped foot into the main hall it felt like a concert. you had people standing at the door to check your bags, and people guiding you to your seats. if you were a first timer, you get special seats with the best view. we felt like VIPs.

the worship was great. the music, the energy, i loved it. they had really good singers, like hillsong level singers. the pastor was young, in his 30s, and had the humor that would get the whole place laughing. his charisma was maxed out. his sermon was short and sweet though. it touched on one chapter, and he kept things light, but he lit a flame in you without condemning you. he also kept it relatable and brought things down to level with you.

for lunch we went to buffet palace. it was 20 dollars for an unlimited buffet of sushi, crawfish, korean kalbi short ribs, crab legs, and more. my parents were excited about the crawfish. we spent 2 hours there before we went to regal westgate to watch we bury the dead. it was honestly not bad. i expected a zombie movie but it was more of a movie about accepting grief and loss. the ending wasn't great but it was a fun watch. i liked the scene where the dad zombie dig his own grave for his family.

then we went to central Market which was nearby and got a few things. my parents loved the store, and was surprised at seeing so many kinds of potatoes and apples and lemons.
