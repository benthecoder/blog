Some useful tactics to [getting things done](https://dubroy.com/blog/getting-things-done-in-small-increments/) in small increments by Patrick Dubroy.

- **Make small progress everyday**: most things worth doing take longer, make a little progress even if it's 20 minutes a day
- **Always know what the next thing to do is**: have a clear end goal (e.g. fix this bug) or concrete next step (e.g. write function to do X), add TODO statements in code.
- Pay attention to **feedback loops**: fast feedback is important when working in small increments, this might mean hot reload for React, TDD, etc.
- For bigger things, **make a plan and keep a log**: take 10-15 minutes to write down a plan before starting, when you get interrupted, take 30 seconds to summarize your progress and any next steps
- **Block distractions**: HN, Twitter, block these websites on your computer, make context switching hard, use arc spaces to help you focus on one thing.
