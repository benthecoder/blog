i got an idea from YC's [Startup Ideas You Can Now Build With AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4s6Cgicw_A&t=1s) video. Gary talked about a blogging platform you can vibe blog. it was inspired from this blog post by [Pete Koomen](https://koomen.dev/essays/horseless-carriages/), about horseless carriages.

i believe the premise is think of a blog platform where writers can "vibe" their way through writing by applying different prompts that are tuned to their writing style? it would be powerful if the reader also has their own custom promtps that are tuned to their reading preferences. a platform that adapts to whoever is laying eyes on it.
