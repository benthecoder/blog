today is the big day. i didn't feel much excitement for it. but i'm happy my parents are here to experience it.

woke up at 10 am and everyone was blasting my phone. brian came over and took meetings at my house. my parents came in. W came in after as well.

we took the waymo to the st ignatious church. i went to pick up my regalia. it took a while to figure out how to put on the neck "scarf" thing.

it was overwhelming outside the library, there were 3 ceremonies happening on the same day

i saw my friends all in one room. everyone making sure they were well-dressed in their regalia.

we walked into the church and everyone was filming at us and celebrating.

after the long ceremony we all took photos with our loved ones.

i'm glad i met everyone here.

W's family and mine ate dinner at capitol restaurant.

we got 2 plates of fried chicken wings, bitter melon with beef, pork ribs with black bean, red braised tofu, and deep fried cat fish.
