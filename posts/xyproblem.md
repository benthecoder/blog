You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so.

Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y.

Someone tries to help you with Y, but is confused because it seems like a strange problem to solve.

After a lot of time wasted, it becomes clear that the user really needs help with X, and Y was a dead end.

This is the [XY](https://xyproblem.info/) [problem](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem).

It leads to an huge amount of wasted time and energy on both parties.

- share what you've tried and solutions that you have ruled out, it gives more information about your requirements.
