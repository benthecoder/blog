i've been craving korean food since i moved to austin, so we had lunch at Seoul Tofu & Jjim, their beef short rib soup was great.

after lunch we walked to Ada's Technical Books and Cafe along E Harrison St and saw beautiful fiery maple trees.

we couldn't find any seats in the book store, so we went next door to Victrola Coffee Roasters instead. we got our usual orders, matcha for me and chai for her.

for dinner, on a whim i searched for japanese restaurants, and found Kobuta & Ookami Katsu and sake house. dare i say the best katsu i've had.

at night we watched dead poets society. it was a beautiful movie. one that comes to mind from time to time when i stop to think about whether i'm truly living, or just existing.

> "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion... Poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."

> "The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?"

> "You must strive to find your own voice. Because the longer you wait to begin, the less likely you are to find it at all."
