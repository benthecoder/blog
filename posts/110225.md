felt betrayed when i flipped through the quiz paper and it was only a tenth of the total content. my cheatsheet was pointless. i only needed two lines out of 100. i finished in 5 minutes, but decided to spend 35 more minutes just checking again, waiting, napping, and overthinking about my answers. i eventually left and finally rememberd to call ucsf about faxing my imaging orders to simonmed. did some hackathon planning in distributed class. i did not intake a single thing in class. helped adrian mock interview during lunch. i love tofu sheets, they taste good when stir fried with soy sauce.

cody's class made us write alongside and submit as attendance, that's a genius move, he should do it more. i love being forced to write things down by hand, especially math equations because i despise doing that and would not do that in my own time. this is what i paid classes for, to do more math so my brain is not degenerating from using AI. felt so tired agian, i'm always drained after lunch.

met with B to ask for training code, it's more complicated than i thought and it takes 8 hours. is code written in research ever clean? i wonder how OAI and anthropic structures their codebase. i need better swe skills. i'm sure i can be using datascience cookiecutter or wandb, and be a lot more efficient, but i'm too busy iterating that i don't have time to setup.

went to costco with mafia, read mere christianity on the bus. this is a great book, it contains ideas i've always wanted to tackle for my faith, like what is evil and did God created it or did it exist from the beginning? an eternal battle between good and evil? from what i've read, evil cannot exist without good, that's why lucifer is a fallen angel, you can't be bad for badness sake, badness comes from striving for good things in the wrong way. got my usuals, chicken, frozen salmon packs, my 15 nut butter that costs 16 dollars, and cashews. took a waymo back, it was a longer route passing by the ferry building, 28 minutes in total. blasted some kpop.

felt drained and tired, kept napping on my desk. feeling anxious and worried about everything, like a looming disaster. feeling sick and tired too.
