[Ukiyo-e](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/plea/hd_plea.htm), or "pictures of the [floating world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo)" is a form of Japanese art from the [Edo period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period).

It is a reflection of the cultural and societal shifts in Japan during the Edo period, producing paintings and [woodblock prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing) that celebrated the pleasures of life in the city, adopting the idea of [“joie de vivre”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre).

[The Great Wave off Kanagawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) is one of the most [famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBcB_dYtGUg) ukiyo-e prints by [Hokusai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai).
