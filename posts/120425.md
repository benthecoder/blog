i woke up at 6:45 am. so early i could pass out dead on the floor upon getting up from the bed. we took a lyft to presidio. i'm meeting W's boss for his startup. we're chatting about joining as an early employee after graduating. i felt anxious about this, i never feel capable enough, especially after the linkedin rejection.

it was a half day trip starting in muir woods, we did the same trail i did with my friends from tesla. it brought back memories of a past, a past version of myself that no longer exists. then we went mill valley, a small town that looked like carmel. i got an everything bagel at equator coffee, and we checked out the library i've always wanted to go. then we went to san rafael to get lunch at sol food. i was having trouble eating again. it could be the friend plantain chips. i had zero appetite. after that we stopped by at saosalito. i got tired and napped in the car on the way home.

we got home at 4 pm. after submitting homework we went to the spc hackathon. we made origamis, and i worked on the front-end and generated a bunch of games with claude. we hacked till 2 a.m. feeling optimistic that we can be in the top 10.
