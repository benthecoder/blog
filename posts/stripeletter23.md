In [Stripe 2023 Annual Letter](https://assets.ctfassets.net/fzn2n1nzq965/1gMd12owbzJaSe4Y560OEJ/2a1dd409beabd1b4796a907554425b45/Stripe_2023_annual_letter.pdf), they have a section on new progress in technology, outlining four sectors that breed an optimistic future.

What kickstarted the industrial revolution was not any special knowledge, but just an "improving mindset".

> It was not a particular skill or some special knowledge, but a frame of mind—a lens through which they perceived the status quo as being imperfect, and then sought to rectify those imperfections.

### Clean Energy and Carbon Removal

> BloombergNEF [estimates](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/20/bloombergnef-says-global-pv-installations-could-hit-574-gw-this-year/#:~:text=It%20said%20that%20new%20solar,and%20722%20GW%20in%202028.) that the world deployed **444 GW of solar energy** last year, surpassing all the nuclear grid capacity globally. In the US, this translates to ~half of all new capacity added to the grid came from solar.
>
> Costs in both PV and batteries have fallen roughly tenfold in the past decade.
>
> Solar is increasingly the cheapest energy solution.
>
> The learning curve for solar and batteries is showing exponential improvement.
>
> The battery learning curve is as durable as the solar curve, making batteries highly complementary to solar.

### Robotics

> A single hour of operating a gas-powered mower produces the same amount of smog-forming pollution as driving a gas-powered car 300 miles.
>
> Manna Aero's drones make 7–8 deliveries per hour at speeds of 50 mph and cost one-tenth of human delivery.
>
> Bright Machines operates over 100 microfactories, significantly cutting production costs.
>
> Dexterity's robots work alongside humans in complex manipulations in unpredictable environments.

### Farming

> Per-acre corn yields in the US have grown by around 30% since 2000.
>
> FarmHQ saves 500,000 gallons of water and reduces labor and input costs by $2,000–$5,000 per device annually.
>
> OnePointOne's vertical farm produces 250 times more plants per acre than traditional farms.
