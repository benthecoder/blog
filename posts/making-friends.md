I read this [article](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/11/10/making-friends-adults) about making friends as an adult, and it made me reflect about my time in Cali.

I met a lot of people during my summer interning with Tesla in California. I also had a lot of fun.

I tried surfing, jet skiing, lived in 3 separate airbnbs, went to a food fair, tried weed (twice), and went down up to San Francisco almost every weekend.

It found it easy to make friends, in fact I made more close friends in these 3 months that I did 2 years at Iowa State University.

There's just something about everyone being interns. We're all vulnerable and actively seeking for belonging and connection (being in a completely new place), and at the same time, willing to do anything fun and exciting (since we were in California).

I'm going back this summer, and a part of me fears it will never be the same again, that I won't meet the same people I did last year.

But I knowÂ it's foolish because it all comes down to my own intentions in making new friends, stepping outside my comfort zone, and actively seeking new experiences.

Even though it's going to be tiring as an introvert, it's going to be worth it.

Future me if you're reading this, stop thinking so much and just do it.
