A fun [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I) on how to start conversations with strangers.

> 1. Just do it
> 2. Skip small talk, ask personal questions
> 3. There is no room for negativity, instead find the things in common
> 4. Give a honest unique compliment
> 5. Ask for a simple opinion
> 6. Be present, eye-contact
> 7. Remember their details (Name/place etc)

A good question to ask is where are you from and where does your family live.
