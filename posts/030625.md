i dragged two luggages all the way to the museum where we last stood under the rain past midnight. this time it rained too. we took our final few shots on the camera. we took the train together to tauyuan airport. we exchanged cards, the prompt was to write about memorable and special moments from the past few days. i had a lot to write about and i meant every word. i felt sad leaving, but i know i'll see her very soon again.

i got home and around 10pm and ate chicken porridge that my sister cooked for me. my throat was still ruined, but i felt safe being home. my parents were returning the next day.
