made prs for different parts of my code. it wasn't until i started at oe that i realize the importance of compartmentalizing parts of my code so its easier to review.

also set up poetry development environment with pyenv, and direnv for auto-activation. python env is still a headache. i now just use uv. i believe uv solves everything

went to pickup the pottery we made at mud studio. they actually turned out so well. i would love to do it again with T
