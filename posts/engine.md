A great [TED-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgzxhDHjzms) on ICE vs EVs.

A super simple summary:

Non-electric cars run on internal combustion engines, we call them ICE vehicles.

ICE vehicles

- have cylinders with piston that convert linear motion into rotational motion
  - combustion occurs when air and fuel are sprayed into the cylinder and ignited/compressed
    - in gasoline, there is a spark plug that ignites the gas
    - in diesel, the compression alone creates a mini explosion
- gas pedal controls the amount of air and fuel released into the chamber, more fuel = more power = faster rotation
- thousands of blast happen per minute
- inefficient: only 16-25% of energy goes towards moving the wheels
  - produces 15% of total global carbon emissions
- has >2000 moving parts to help contain, cool, and maintain combustion

Electric vehicles

- induction motors
  - stator: series of rings with copper wires wrapped around it (conduction creates rotating magnetic field)
  - rotor: a rotating magnetic core that spins with the magnetic field
- accelerator changes frequency of current driven into wires of stator, changing the speed of the rotor
- 65-69% of energy goes directly to moving the wheels
- has 20 parts
- can integrate energy-saving devices
  - regenerative braking: when you brake, the motor runs backwards and captures kinetic energy to recharge battery
  - rooftop solar panels to increase range
- not always carbon neutral, emission profile depends on the source of electricity
