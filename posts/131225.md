went to the design district and had lunch at pura vida miami. then went to maman cafe to get some work done.

fun fact: this place started as a pineapple farm in the 1920s called buena vista. T.V. moore, the "pineapple king," built the moore building in 1921 for his furniture business. the area became a furniture and design center through the mid-20th century but fell into disrepair by the 80s. then in the late 90s, developer craig robins bought up abandoned buildings and transformed it into what it is today, spanning 18 blocks with over 200 luxury brands, michelin-starred restaurants, and public art installations. retail rent is $500 per square foot, making it the 5th priciest US retail destination.

at night i brought T to brickell, and we tried thai food at Bonding. it was the only affordable asian food near brickell and it was a letdown. the pad thai tasted like ketchup and i ordered the wrong fried fish. but we still had a good time.
