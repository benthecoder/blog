> Action is expensive, but inaction costs a fortune - [FS](https://fs.blog/brain-food/july-16-2023/)

Inaction is the default. It's the status quo. If you're fine with where you are, you won't do anything.

If you want to get to the next level, you need to understand the cost of doing nothing.

Inaction doesn't mean laying down and staring at the ceiling.

I see inaction here as not actively working towards where you want to be in life, because it takes effort and sacrifice.

Inaction is not biting the bullet, it's distracting yourself with what's easier.

Inaction is making excuses, and saying there's always tomorrow.

Take action every single day.

Let curiosity guide you. And action will follow.
