Went into a mini rabbit hole on [flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower?useskin=vector) last night and here are a few things I gathered.

## Flowers

In botany there are 4 [types of plants](https://www.bioexplorer.net/plants/), one of them is angiosperms ([flowering plants](https://www.bioexplorer.net/plant-life-cycle.html/#3_Life_Cycle_of_Angiosperms_Flowering_Plants))

There are three primary kinds of flowers: annuals, perennials, and biennials.

A fourth type behaves in annuals and perennials like a hybrid.

There are two more kinds of flowers: shrub flowers and tree flowers

I was searching for a website that has a collection of all the flowers in the world, with pictures, and this page on [BioExplorer](https://www.bioexplorer.net/plants/flowers/) is the best one yet.

I also made [a list of flower gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ls5anPTwGSE2BR1W6) across the world that I hope to visit in the future.

## quotes on flowers
