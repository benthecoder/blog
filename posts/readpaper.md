A paper on [how to read papers](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).

Reading papers is an untaught skill.

This paper introduces a "three-pass approach"

### 1. The First Pass: What's the idea? (5-10 mins)

This quick scan helps to get a general understanding of the paper and decide if further reading is necessary. It involves:

- Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
- Read section and sub-section headings, ignore everything else
- Read the conclusions
- Glance over the references

By the end of this pass, you should identify five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype?
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paperâ€™s main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

### 2. The Second Pass: Grasps the content (~ 1 hour)

In this stage, read the paper more carefully but skip over details like proofs:

- Examine figures and diagrams closely. Pay special attentions to graphs
- Take notes and mark important references for future reading.

By the end of this pass, you should be able to:

- grasp content of paper
- summarize main thrust of paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else

If you don't understand it, either it is a new subject matter, an experimental technique, or it's poorly written

### 3. The Third Pass: Go in depth, re-implement (4-5 hours)

This is an in-depth reading where you try to understand the paper at a deeper level and identifying its strengths and weaknesses.

- implement the paper: make the same assumptions as the authors and re-create the work
- identify and challenge every assumption in every statement
- compare yours and the actual paper, identify the paper's innovation and hidden failings and assumptions.
- jot down ideas for future work

By the end of this pass, you should be able to:

- reconstruct the entire structure of paper from memory
- Identify its strong and weak points
- pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with the techniques

### Guidelines for reading

- Read critically
  - don't assume authors are always correct, ask appropriate questions
- Read creatively
  - what are the good ideas in this paper?
  - Do the ideas have other applications or extensions?
  - are there possible improvements
  - what would be the next thing you would do?
  - Do one pass on each paper
- Make notes as you read

### Doing a Literature Survey

When conducting a literature survey, the three-pass approach is valuable:

1. **Starting Point**: Use academic search engines with specific keywords to find initial papers and read their related work sections.
2. **Identifying Key Papers**: Look for shared citations and author names in these papers to find key research in the area.
3. **Exploring Conference Proceedings**: Visit top conference websites in the field and browse their proceedings for recent high-quality work.

Through this method, you can efficiently conduct a literature survey by identifying and understanding the most relevant papers in a field.
