I'm graduating with a Statistics bachelor's degree but felt like I don't really understand anything about statistics yet.

I asked my research professor, Dr J. about what I should takeaway from my degree.

This is his response.

Inference

- Random sample (sample -> prediction)
- Random assignment of treatment allows claims of causality

Uncertainty

- data are random
- belief and frequency interpretation for probability
- expectation vs prediction
  - confidence interval for mu (E[y])
  - prediction interval for y tilde
