i spent 6 hours on the lab homework and i could have avoided this suffering by putting more thought into what was wrong, devising a plan, before taking actions. i kept trying the first thing that came to mind, and was optimizing for speed instead of efficiency. the first major hiccup was using both uv and pyenv to run my port forwarding code and kubernetes code, so it wasn't communicating to each other. the second thing was my @conda package versions, the mlflow version was so old that the API for registering models did not exist, but i thought it was some auth issues when is earched online. i came out of these labs realizing that devops and infra is difficult to debug because there's so many components interacting with each other, and you should act strategically or you'll end up in multiple rabbit holes.

my throat is inflamed and it affects my breathing too. i'm glad A is around. i also felt feverish the rest of the day. i want to go home to get a checkup. it's so hard to see a doctor here.
