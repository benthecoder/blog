meals:

- breakfast: rice + salad + avocado
- lunch: torchys chicken bowl
- dinner: salmon + rice + salad

worked at the office, been eating a heavier breakfast in the morning so i can withstand a later lunch with the team. working at the office is nice. i need to get better at joining in conversations though. i'm the kind of person that says things when prompted or when necessary. unless i'm feeling drunky tired or with close friends who won't jduge me.

tomorrow: standup DEMO

slept: 12 a.m.
