Tech companies are [increasingly](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247794) choosing to hire PhD students in Economics.

I read an [article](https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8) about the Economics Team at Instacart, and here are my takeaways.

### Projects they worked on

1. Optimized Bidding Feature for Advertising Partners:
   - **Core Challenge**: Tackling the intricacies of ad auction dynamics.
   - **Economic Principles Applied**: Ads incrementality, auction formats, and auction pressure.
   - **Technical Environment**: High-volume, latency-sensitive.
   - **Solution Characteristics**: Custom-built algorithms for flexible, effective bidding strategies.
   - **Outcome**: Significantly improved performance for advertising partners, showcasing the power of blending economic insights with machine learning in a real-time, data-intensive environment.
2. Contextual Bandit Algorithms for Incentive Targeting:
   - **Economic Insight**: Utilization of econometrics for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects and optimizing business metric trade-offs.
   - **Machine Learning Approach**: Traditional MLE skills applied to both batch and real-time inference models.
   - **Integration**: Seamless embedding into production environments, demonstrating a fusion of economic theory with practical machine learning applications.
   - **Anticipated Insight**: A future blog post will delve deeper, indicating ongoing refinement and evolution of this approach.
3. Causal Inference Applications:
   - **Methodological Innovation**: Use of surrogate models for long-term outcome measurement.
   - **Experiment Design**: Leveraging natural experiments for more robust experiment designs.
   - **Treatment Effect Analysis**: Estimating causal impacts of non-random treatments, like Instacart+ membership.
   - **Data Segmentation**: Construction of customer segments for nuanced input into ML models and detailed analysis of experimental results, demonstrating the application of econometric techniques in data segmentation for enhanced predictive accuracy.

### Their Value as Economists:

1. **Holistic Problem-Solving Approach**: Merging economic theory with machine learning to tackle complex, multidimensional problems, providing end-to-end solutions.
2. **Efficient and Effective Solution Development**: Rapid development and deployment of solutions, facilitated by the dual expertise in economics and technology, showcasing a streamlined process for handling complex, data-intensive tasks.
3. **Insight into Economic Principles and Causal Inference**: Profound grasp of economic theories and causal relationships, driving data-centric decision-making and refining experiment designs for improved outcomes.
4. **Versatility and Adaptability**: Cross-functional capabilities, enabling work across diverse product areas and problem types, adding a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to traditional tech roles, and catalyzing innovation and growth.
