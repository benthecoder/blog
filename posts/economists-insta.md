Tech companies are [increasingly](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247794) choosing to hire PhD students in Economics.

I read an [article](https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8) about the Economics Team at Instacart, and here are my takeaways.

### Projects they worked on

The economists at Instacart, part of their Econ Team, work on a variety of challenging projects that blend economics with machine learning.

1. **Optimized Bidding for Ad Auctions:**
   - **Economic Understanding:** The team applied their knowledge of ads incrementality, auction formats, and auction pressure to develop a comprehensive understanding of the ads marketplace.
   - **Technical Solution:** Developed an algorithm for optimized bidding, tailored for a high-volume, latency-sensitive environment, offering flexible and effective bidding options for advertising partners.
   - **Impact and Collaboration:** Worked closely with the Ads team, achieving strong results and providing significant value to advertising partners through this initiative.
2. **Contextual Bandit Algorithms for Incentive Targeting:**
   - **Economic Analysis:** Utilized econometric methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects and optimize trade-offs between different business metrics.
   - **Model Development:** Created both batch inference and real-time inference models, integrating them into the system for effective upsell placement.
   - **Production Integration:** Ensured the models were production-ready, aligning them with Instacart's operational environment and achieving practical utility in a real-world setting.
3. **Causal Inference and Experimental Design:**
   - **Long-term Outcome Measurement:** Used surrogate models to measure long-run outcomes, demonstrating the capacity to understand and predict extended impacts of various initiatives.
   - **Natural Experiments:** Leveraged natural experiments for experiment design, including treatments inspired by regression discontinuities, showcasing innovative approaches to problem-solving.
   - **Non-randomized Treatment Effects:** Estimated causal effects of treatments like Instacart+ membership and developed customer segments for enhanced model inputs and experimental analysis, contributing significantly to understanding customer behavior and preferences.

### Their Value as Economists:

1. **Holistic Problem-Solving Approach**: Merging economic theory with machine learning to tackle complex, multidimensional problems, providing end-to-end solutions.
2. **Efficient and Effective Solution Development**: Rapid development and deployment of solutions, facilitated by the dual expertise in economics and technology, showcasing a streamlined process for handling complex, data-intensive tasks.
3. **Insight into Economic Principles and Causal Inference**: Profound grasp of economic theories and causal relationships, driving data-centric decision-making and refining experiment designs for improved outcomes.
4. **Versatility and Adaptability**: Cross-functional capabilities, enabling work across diverse product areas and problem types, adding a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to traditional tech roles, and catalyzing innovation and growth.
