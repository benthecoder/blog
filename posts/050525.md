i started tracking time on timelines app so that i would see when my time is slowly ticking away when i'm procrastinating.

i focused on doing just two things today. the birdclef challenge and the local document classification.

cooked chicken soup for my sister

signed up for zip car but my phone number was one digit off so i couldn't get on the app.

ordered a lyft for her and she arrived at 1 a.m.

slept a little too late at 3 a.m. trying to get the birdclef model to train.
