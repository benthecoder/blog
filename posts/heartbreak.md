I was at the Denver airport for a layover and read the final chapter of [Heartbreak](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58085256) by Florence Williams.

Here were some interesting takeaways.

- Ritual purgation. The Japanese hires a divorce ceremony for proper divorce celebration with food flowers and a large mallet to smash wedding ring
- Literature predicts 3 to 4 years for ones emotional and physical health to return to baseline after heartbreak
- The best thing to heal a heartbreak are distance, perspective and passage of time
- Fish eggs still hatch after eaten and excreted by ducks
- An inkling of optimism that while the world sometimes seem chaotic and unjust, it is beautiful and ever changing. Somehow most things will work out in the end if we just help them along
