from [Etienne Garbugli](https://www.etiennegarbugli.com/home/): [26 Time Management Hacks I Wish I'd Known at 20](https://www.slideshare.net/egarbugli/26-time-management-hacks-i-wish-id-known-at-20?curius=3796)

- Only plan for 4-5 hours of real work per day
- It's normal to have days where you just can't work and days where you'll work 12 hours straight
  - work more when you're in the zone. Relax when you're not.
- Your time is $1000/hour, respect your time and act accordingly
- Stop multi-tasking, it only kills your focus
- Set up a work routine and stick to it, your body will adapt
- Time block: You're more focused and productive with limited time
- Work is the best way to get working. Start with short and small tasks.
- Work iteratively. don't expect to do things perfectly
  > "Doing is better than perfect" – Facebook motto
- More work hours != more productivity.
- Separate brainless and strategic tasks
  > "Separate thinking and execution to execute faster and think better" – Sol Tanguay
- Put important meetings early in the day so you can focus on other work after
- Group meetings and communication (email or phone) to create blocks of uninterrupted work
- Avoid context switching: keep the same context throughout the day.
- Work around procrastination. Procrastinate between sprints of work (Pomodoro)
- break things down
  > Break the unreasonable down into little reasonable chunks. A big goal is only achieved when every little thing that you do everyday, gets you closer to that goal – Maren Kate, Escaping the 9 to 5
- Always prioritize: No 2 task holds the same importance. sort/group your to-do list by importance
- Always know the **one thing** you need to get done during the day that has the biggest impact
- Break tasks into hour increments. Long tasks are hard to get into.
- Delegate and learn to make use of other people.
  > "If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate!" – John C. Maxwell
- Only think about today and tomorrow.
  > "Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games" – Babe Ruth
- Set deadlines for everything. Don't let tasks run indefinitely.
- Set end dates for intense or stressful activities
- Always take notes and set reminders. Your brain is fallible and your memory cannot be trusted
- Write down anything that distracts you – random thoughts, new ideas, emotions. Once you write them down, they'll stop bothering you when you try to focus
- Take breaks. Sometimes.
