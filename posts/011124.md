> In the end, I care less about what I accomplish and more about the man I am while accomplishing. Who I become through my work – tommy dixon, [how to work](https://www.tommydixon.ca/p/how-to-work)

so surreal to see family in my house, walking with them on columbus ave. feels comforting

dinner with family and W at the cilentano per A's recommendation. it was a 700 ringgit italian meal. converting is not a good idea.

i had the spaghetti al granchio. gnocchi is like a soft and warm pillow. first time eating capers. crab meat tasted funny.

found out that owner's wife is half malaysian. very friendly guy.

took the bus to swensen's and had ice cream. obligatory picture taking for sis. 0.5x camera shots are so fun.

tried out [computer use](https://github.com/deedy/mac_computer_use?curius=2055) past midnight for hackathon next day. it's unreliable without specific instructions, and tokens shoot up to millions so fast.

slept at 3:30 a.m.
