![Key Biscane Crandon Beach](/images/141225-crandon-beach.jpg)

we arrived at crandon beach around 2 pm. we saw a lot of peacocks in the parking lot. i was surprised they just roamed around like that. in my head i always thought peacocks were rare creatures. i put on my photographer's hat and started snapping away. it was nice to be at the beach, the feeling of your bare feet on sand, the weather was perfect. we sat down and had some snacks and crackers and talked. it made me like miami a lot more.

i wanted to go to the lighthouse but it was closed, so our lyft driver brought us on a detour to a port where there was a bar called the cleat mia instead. there was a nice view of the sea and the skyline. we watched the sun go down and black outlines of boats and ships floating on the sea.

we went to CMX brickell to watch hamnet. we had burgers and fries again, and T said the one in austin was better. hamnet was a raw experience. i felt grateful for the medical breakthroughs and technology we have today to be able to cure sickness and diseases, because it's so scary to die while suffering without any access to doctors. 

i was also reminded of the power of storytelling. at the stage area, people from all ranks, peasants and royalty, came to watch his hamlet play and it reminded me of the power of acting, not just gratuitous enjoyment, but it can communicate very raw experiences and emotions that help a mother move on and heal from her grief as well.
