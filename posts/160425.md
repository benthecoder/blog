i finally started my volunteering for my SFMTA fine. it was a 3 hour session at the botanical garden book store. after getting familiarized with the store and the plant shop, i was told to say hello how are you to all passerbys and the store customers. i had to come out of my own shell. i got to stand at their counter and work with the square system, asking people how they are, commenting on what they bought, telling them the total amount, and thanking them for coming. i also placed label stickers and books with price tags. i also got a 15 min break in between to walk around the garden. i felt my soul reentering my body, and i could take a deeper breath in the garden. after that i went to the green apple bookstore.

I liked this quote:

> Some have a great dream in life that they never accomplish. Others have no dream, and likewise never accomplish it.
>
> – The Book of Disquiet, Fernando Pessoa

I also fancied this book cover – The Emissary by Yoko Tawada. I'll pick up this book one day. If only I commited more time to read.
