> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
> â€” Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month

I like the notion of programming [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/). With AI, it's possible to build out any idea that comes to my mind, and code 10x faster that I used to before.

Lately I've been learning SwiftUI, and I have a [ton of ideas](https://www.notion.so/benneo/project-ideas-63bc556d83a5405da1bcd89629da2a0e) that I want to build out, apps that I personally would use. It's been a fun experience to operate at the edge of my abilities. I can't wait till the day I ship out my app to the testflight, and have my friends test out my apps. And eventually to the app store, for anyone in the world.
