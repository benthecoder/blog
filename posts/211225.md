![Zilker Botanical Garden Ginkgo tree leaves](/images/211225-zilker-botanical.jpg)

took my parents to the south austin campus of ACC but it ended up having a combined service, so on the spur of the moment i brought them to the botanical garden. 

it ended up being a solid experience. there's a nice view of zilker park and the austin skyline, and going deeper into the garden, past the japanese garden, there's a section with dinosaur fossils and ginkgo trees, which i learned date back to before dinosaurs and co-existed with them. for lunch i ordered lee's kitchen again, so far the best asian food in austin i could find.
