In the [Knowledge Project podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OPB0bix6CQ), he shares the [value of deadlines](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/kevin-kelly/):

> "It took me a long time to figure out that I needed deadlines. <mark>Deadlines were the difference between a dream and something that you complete.</mark>
>
> And what happens with deadlines is that <mark>you’ve got to ship, you have to abandon the project, and it’s not perfect. Because it’s not perfect, you kind of have to be ingenious about making it a little different</mark>.
>
> And I find that the deadlines force me to make decisions that you don’t have enough time [for]; you never have enough time. And so you think of something to—I wouldn’t say it’s a shortcut—you think of a way to finish it, and those little decisions are what make it a little different."

And on changing someone's mind

> The best way to have any hope of changing someone’s mind is to try to listen and truly understand why they think what they’re thinking and how they got there. <mark>You can’t reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.</mark>
