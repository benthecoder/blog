[The Proust Questionnaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire?useskin=vector) is a set of questions answered by French writer Marcel Proust in a [confession book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_album?useskin=vector) that belonged to his friend Antoinette, titled "An Album to Record Thoughts, Feelings, etc."

Below are some of his [answers](https://www.library.illinois.edu/rbx/kolbproust/proust/qst/)

His idea of happiness:

> To live in contact with those I love, with the beauties of nature, with a quantity of books and music, and to have, within easy distance, a French theater.

His favorite color:

> The beauty is not in the colors, but in their harmony.

And "What I should like to be?"

> Myself, as the people whom I admire would like me to be.
