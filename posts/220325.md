went to A's house to eat my chow fun with beef and then to social study to start the interview grind. went to east mall for a thrift store with vintage games, records, and overpriced second hand clothes. went to the asian grocery stores and i finally found asian thai green curry paste. bought a pack of brown rice as well. took a model s home with A. played ticket to ride the rest of the night.
