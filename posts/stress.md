There's a [study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG7L9IIlYpQ) with over 30,000 people people had higher risk of illness and death related to stress only if they thought stress is bad for them.

stress is only harmful if you think it is

If you don't focus on meaning making, values alignment, see it's benefits, focus on how it can feel you, and how it can help you perform

Isolate yourself.

If you're stressed don't be around other stressed people.
