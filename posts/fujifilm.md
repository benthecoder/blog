A video on [Fuji X100VI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNb4hPvLWYQ) popped up on my YT feed one day and that started a week-long rabbit hole down digital film cameras.

I started getting a ton of videos on digital film cameras on my homepage.

Eventually, starting with Fuji, then discovering Ricoh, Olympus, Leica, and Panasonic, I eventually landed back on the x100s, which is the 2nd gen of the X100 series.

Today, I met up with a seller to buy a third-hand x100s at KLCC.

I was at the food court going through every detail about the camera, making sure this is a good purchase. This is my first camera, ever, so I asked a lot of basic questions about photography as well. I paid RM1999 for it, which I believe is a good deal. Even though the silver paint has come off at the edges, and it looks old, but I like that it has history; It's been in the hands of two photographers who enjoyed the craft.

When I walked home from the train station with my mom I took a lot of shots.

I made an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bengotafujifilm/) page for the special ones, with more to come.

I added a couple [X-Trans II recipes](https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-ii-recipes/) to fully utilize what fujifilm has to offer.

I'm still confused about [what an ND filter does](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4142610).

And just learned what shutter speed, ISO and aperture does. I found a good [eli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/aq1y0a/eli5_photography_shutter_speed_iso_and_aperture/).

For some notes

- these three are knobs that control how much brightness you get
- shutter speed
  - shorter = little light
  - longer = lots of light (produces the blur effect in photos)
- sensitivity (ISO)
  - lower = less sensitive (bright)
  - higher = more sensitive (more grainy and noisy)
- aperture (f-stop)
  - lower (f/1.8) = wider opening, more brightness (shallow depth of field, portrait mode)
  - higher (f/16) = narrow opening, less brightness (entire image in focus)

You want an image where the brightest points are not almost-but-not-quite 100% white, and the darkest points are almost-but-not-quite 100% black.

A nice analogy for aperture

> Make a pin hole with one hand, hold it up to your eye (like a teeny tiny telescope) and then stretch your other arm and hold up a finger. Notice the finger and background will both be in focus. Remove your pinhole hand and then you can manually focus on either the finger or background.

One practical tip is to use the exposure-meter which tells you how exposed the photo is going to be.

I'm excited to see what moments I can capture from this camera.

Next is to buy a camcorder and start vlogging.
