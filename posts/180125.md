coworked with the mafia and L to help with our [hackathon website](https://www.chinatownhack.com) at hotel kabuki.

lots of taste involved in color theory and font choice. what makes something nice? what makes something bad? so much of taste is subjective. is there a universal measure of taste? quality can be measured, but taste feels more personal.

i felt so excited and proud of my designs without hearing feedback from both sides initially. hearing my font choice was not great felt difficult at first, but it slowly reframed my view and perspective, and made me switch from liking it to disliking it as well

made me think about my conviction in my taste, how much of it do i let others mould? how much do i hold strongly? perhaps i need more exposure and more practice. feedback is essential, but which feedback to trust? from people who have done this more than i have. people who also received more feedback that i have. the ones who has pushed the rock further up the mountain.
