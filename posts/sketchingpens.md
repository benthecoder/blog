got distracted by a few sketching videos on youtube today when I should be packing and doing other work

first one was [How To Draw Like The Masters - John Singer Sargent's Simple Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtBW4IndVE)

Next time I see his sketches I'll to notice how brave and simple they are. It's not the most technical or detailed, but it captures so much with so little.

an artist's style is so unique to their personality and influenced by their personal experiences and teachings.

then it was a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kA9Qk4HKa4) about [Zac Crawford](https://www.instagram.com/theartistzac/?hl=en), an NYC artist who sketches people at Washington Square park. He draws people every single day, and has sketched up to 100,000 people so far. he developed his fast drawing skills and unique style by drawing people on the subway.

then a video about the [importance of sketchbooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkFuWIEaRCQ)

"The worst sketchbook is an unused one", treat sketchbooks as a journal, the goal is not to fill them but to use them.

i got inspired to start sketching with ink pens and found this video: [Improve your INK PEN SKETCHING with this easy tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHM7CNyFoIQ)

Pens I'm currently looking into:

- Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pen India Ink Pens
- Faber-Castell PITT Artist Pen Superfine Fineliner - Indranthene Blue (247) 1.5mm
- SAKURA Pigma Micron Fineliner Pens - Archival Black Ink Pens

one day, I'll pick up one of these pens and a moleskin sketchbook, and sketch people in the park, cafe shops, and on the train.
