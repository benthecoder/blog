I had a chat with Karun, he's offering free 1:1s on Topmate.

Here are some notes:

Why MS > PhD

- didn't have research experience

Why CMU

- narrowed down DS programs, CMU, Stanford and Columbia

experience at amazon

- ships fast
- 6 weeks sprints
- documentation heavy, makes you more replaceable
- uses notebooks in DS team, python files in Applied Science team
- PiP culture
- shipping things on AWS is seamless

experience at walmart

- in e-commerce team, recommender systems, trying out LLMs
- behaves like a startup, mostly GCP
- issues with data, infra, etc.

SDE vs DS

- when you become SME, SWE isn't as fast-paced, do the same things, DS has something new every day
- SWE ships features a lot more, DS shipping model has a lot more failure rate, offline evaluation and metrics don't translate to online

Interview

- Coding (leetcode easy, medium)
- SQL
- Stats (A/B testing, hypothesis testing, p-values)
- ML (basics, assumptions, when to use, metrics)
- Deep Learning (based on what's on your resume and role)
- system design (case study)

LLMs

- good at reading research
- StackOverflow better than ChatGPT

It was great talking to a senior DS currently working in the industry.

Having access to mentors like this is really valuable.

I look forward to more sessions with him and other professionals on topmate.
