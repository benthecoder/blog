Some statistics on plastic

- [430 million tons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10013851/) of plastic is produced yearly
- One-third of this total takes the form of single-use plastics
- [95% of the plastic](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf) used in packaging is disposed of after one use, a loss to the economy of up to $120 billion annually
- One-third of this packaging is not collected -> significant economic cost by reducing productivity of vital natural systems such as the ocean -> $40 billion in damages
- Coca-Cola produced 3 million tons of plastic packaging in 2017
- Average person consumes [five grams](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/newsroom/featured/plastic-ingestion-by-people-could-be-equating-to-a-credit-card-a-week) of plastic every weekâ€”mostly from water
- About [95% of the tap water](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/you-eat-a-credit-card-s-worth-of-plastic-a-week-research-says/) in the United States is contaminated

### Solution

Picking up waste is only fixing a symptom of a larger problem

The solution lies further upstream: we have to make less plastic, develop better, more recyclable products, and find sustainable alternatives that increase [circularity](https://www.unep.org/circularity) (keeping products in use as long as possible)

How much plastic is actually being [recycled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_recycling)?

In the US, only about [5-6% of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/12/1081129/plastic-recycling-climate-change-microplastics) are being recycled.

### Infrastructure and incentive

The biggest problem is a shortage of the [costly infrastructure](https://plasticsrecycling.org/our-team) that's required.

The further from large cities, the less recycling. More **state and federal incentives** to build an **infrastructure for collection** is needed.

### challenges of recycling

The vast [majority](https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/sustainability/how-is-plastic-recycled-a-step-by-step-guide-to-recycling.aspx) of "recycling" is grinding plastic, melting it, and re-forming it. This mechanical recycling well involves properly sorting and cleaning materials, which is time intensive and expensive.

It's also very [difficult](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873020/)/impossible to recycle many types of plastic more than once without causing the material to acquire **defects and [contaminants](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/recycling-contamination/)** (many recycled materials contain high levels of unwanted toxins)

### local policies for recycling

Local policies make a huge difference.

Maine and Oregon invested in recycling programs, and up to 80% of bottles made from PET ([polyethylene terephthalate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate)) are recycled. In some states, such as in the South, that percentage is in the single digits.

The national average for these materials is 30%.

Some states have policies that [hinder progress](https://publicintegrity.org/environment/pollution/pushing-plastic/inside-the-long-war-to-protect-plastic/).

Industry lobbyists are increasingly helping to institute [state-level laws](https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation) that **prevent** bans or limits on the use of plastics, especially plastic bags.

Over a dozen states currently have [preemptive laws](https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/preemption/) on the books to prevent ordinances limiting plastics

### Improving recycling

One, simplify and standardize process of plastic production. Currently more than 10,000 chemicals are used, and upward 3,200 have "one or more [hazardous properties](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report) of concern"

Second, find a way to process mixed polymers into useful materials, instead of having to sort everything first. For example, [chemical process](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.2c00402) that can [transform several types of plastics](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/30/1063837/how-chemists-are-tackling-the-plastics-problem/) into propane, and using [soil bacterium](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo4626) to break down plastics and re-form them to bioplastics.

Third, using microbes that can break down and recycle [PET](https://www.americanbeverage.org/education-resources/blog/post/what-is-pet/). One company doing this is [Carbios](https://www.carbios.com/en/). A [microbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideonella_sakaiensis) discovered in Japan in 2016 was the first one identified that can live solely on plastic as a food source.

### reducing demand

To solve the problem in the plastic pollution crisis, we must solve the root problem: _plastics are shockingly profitable and cheap_

Polymer producers do not pay for the abundant harm they cause. Any solution will require **policy and behavioral changes** small and large.

Tiny changes can add up to reduce demand and decrease pollution.

Example: policymakers in Washington, DC instituted five-cent charge on plastic bags in 2010, and estimates show number of bags dropped by more than half in months, and quantity found in [local waterways dropped 30%-70%](https://gwhatchet.com/2018/02/07/district-tax-leads-to-sharp-decrease-in-plastic-bag-use/)

A global [Extended Producer Responsibility](https://www.oecd.org/environment/extended-producer-responsibility.htm) scheme would be an example of a major shift.

Change will be difficult, but they can be instituted in a way that don't hurt businesses.

Creating incentives for alternatives -> innovation and new jobs.
