i slept around 3 or 4 am, i forget. i had a 9 am meeting the next morning. my body felt like immovable rocks. i woke up at 8:57 am, brushed my teeth and immediately went to my laptop.

i was asked to debug some failure modes and figure out why the answers were bad. i did my best, but my conclusions weren't solid. my codebase understanding was another limiting factor, too. i knew these were the issues but wasn't sure what knobs to turn or what was considered a good solution. i lacked the intuition that someone who built the system from scratch would have.

it made me realize i'm still very replaceable since an AI can probably do what i do right now. i need to be better at asking questions and picking up all the tacit knowledge at this company.
