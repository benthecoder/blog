i took a waymo to montgomery and union st to meet with my landlord for my diploma. i saw a cherry red mazda mata at the corner of the street and i instantly fell in love with it, it became my dream car. the chinese service greeted me back from austin. i love seeing their joy on their faces when they realize i am back. i went to get pho with M and some other friends at church. i shared the difficulties of balancing life and work. one of them gave me a ride home, and we talked about the job market and buying a car. he says he's no longer learning new things at his job. i wonder if that would happen to me, and what i would do in that situation.
