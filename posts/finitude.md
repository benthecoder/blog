A snippet on time management from the book [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54785515)

> "the average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short... Assuming you live to be eighty, youâ€™ll have had about four thousand weeks."

Lee Byron made a [visual essay](https://leebyron.com/4000/) for this book, and upon inputting my DOB, I was told I have lived 1,164 of the weeks. That's almost 30% of my 4000 weeks on this Earth. What will I do with the 70% I have left?

No matter what I do, these [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Thousand_Weeks:_Time_Management_for_Mortals?useskin=vector#Appendix) will help me approach them in a more healthy, earthly manner.

1. Adopt a fixed volume approach to productivity. Establish predetermined boundaries for daily work.
2. Serialize: focus on one big project at a time.
3. Decide in advance what to fail at
4. Focus on your what you've completed, not just on what's left to complete. Keep a "done" list
5. Consolidate care. Consciously choose which causes to support
6. Embrace boring & single purpose technology
7. Seek out novelty in the mundane. Pay more attention to every moment.
8. Be a researcher in relationships; deliberately adopt an attitude of curiosity with others.
9. Cultivate instantaneous generosity; act on generous impulses immediately
10. Practice doing nothing; bear the discomfort of not acting
