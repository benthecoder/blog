[Molly Graham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mograham/) shares [10 things](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/early-career-advice?) she wish she knew at the beginning of her 20s.

tldr: <mark>Collect experiences and people</mark>

Some notes

- Don't obsess about climbing the ladder about levelling up, **focus on learning about yourself** and the world
  - If you know yourself well, everything else comes naturally - what direction to point yourself, what ladder to climb, what makes you happy, fulfilled, and thrive at work
- before hopping on the corporate treadmill, do something that is **truly different** to grow in immeasurable ways: work in another country, work on a farm, etc.
- **Collect experiences**: self-knowledge is one of the most valuable things to get in your 20s, so pick the wrong job a few times, take on a really risky project and fail
- Have a clear [list](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/choosing-your-next-job) of what you **love** and **hate**, and what you're **good at** and **bad at**.
  - the overlap between your list is what you love doing and what you're exceptional at, it'll lead to roles that make you successful and happy
- Seek [J-Curve jobs](https://mollyg.substack.com/p/j-curve), get comfortable with being uncomfortable, best time to take risks, bigger bets, helps you figure out the boundaries of what you're good at
- It is more important to **learn** than to know, make learning a strength, embrace the identity of someone who doesn't need to know everything
- **Be useful** to the people you work with, it gets you access to opportunities that you can never apply for.
- Be a nice person to work with, and leave companies well, take both the learning and **relationship** on the way out
- screw companies, **follow great people**: brilliant managers, mentors, and peers who push you to be better,
- **Collect people**: Build a network by making friends at work, invest in building friendships and get to know your coworkers, keep a spreadsheet to track and stay connected with them.
- working at a well-run company with good managers teaches you about management, how to be exceptional at execution, and professionalism, no better training if you're starting your own company
- you'll only have about two exceptional managers in your life, people who you want to be when you "grow up", go work for them and don't take them for granted
