b10 is so amazing. i get to spin up h100s and finetune big models like gpt oss 20b. it's super fun. i'm glad i get the opportunity to do so. at the same time, it is so hard to get it to do what i want. there is little to no documentation about what i'm doing. and chatgpt is terrible with its hallucinated answers.
