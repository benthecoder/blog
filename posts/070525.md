i got there after talking to T. i was acting childish and brainless, and i have since learned to be careful with my words. i was shocked at my own behaviour.

after the practicum meetings, i went to the figma conf expo and walked around getting stickers with my sister. there were "figjam" plastic walls around for us to draw, i wrote down her name and my blog.

the first swag line was completely empty today, i felt cheated, but i did practice my conversation skills.

i went to marriot to meet up with A, then to capitol one cafe because of the wifi. we worked on the mlops project.

left home, and walked 30 minutes to meet with my sister after her bolt.new party at 715 harrison st. we met a taiwanese waymo employee working at taipei outside of the club.

we took the waymo home.
