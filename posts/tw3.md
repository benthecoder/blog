- woke up and my mind just started overthinking and couldn’t go back to sleep
- Why do many buildings here have tiles outside
- First time trying 抓包
- Been feeling nauseous in rooms and indoors for some reason
- went to dad’s friend factory halfway to jiu fen and saw an industrial neighborhood
- Jiu fen air is so fresh and clean
- The houses on the hills reminds me of SF
- 沙茶面 taste pre good
- beef was melting soft noodle here in Jiufen so good
- Bought another ring, two rings with smiley fives so far from TW, each 280
- I like that you can walk around the neighborhoods by taking detours up or down the stairs from the old streets, saw many Japanese style houses
- It’s also eerily quiet in those areas I wonder if anyone is home
- Saw an old couple watching TV while walking on the street, can’t imagine living right beside a tourist destination
- So many Koreans in Jiu fen
- There was a guy with his baby son speaking french and I wanted to ask comment ça va so badly and say salut but I chickened out
- Ate guava again
- Saw Jensen Huang picture outside a shop, interesting that my sis and dad doesn’t know who he is or what NVIDIA is
- I like that each lantern has 九分 on it
- I didn’t manage to see the spirited away looking place, I have no idea how to get there
- Can’t believe I stepped on dog poop trying to get a good shot of the scenery
- Kept reminding myself to be grateful and glad I have loving parents and sisters and took deep breaths, it helped me appreciate and evaluate and overthink less. But if I can't be present that means there's still something unresolved that I have to deal with.
- Traveling is great because it gets you in the mood and environment to talk to your family and have good conversations that you wouldn't otherwise.
