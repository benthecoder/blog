I came across David Brooks from [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwENbKn3tqI) [few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsZz6cngPeo) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKXo5RReky4) [on](https://youtu.be/6_cEbY8-3EQ?si=OHBYwY6okRAKPW-0) YouTube

I watched his conversation with [Jonathan Capehart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlk0w-5_JO4) today and he talked about a few tips for better conversations.

I read chapter six: Good Talks & chapter seven: The Right Questions from his book, [How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/112974860)

Here are his non-obvious ways to become better conversationalists.

1. attention is an on/off switch; not a dimmer
   - treat attention as all or nothing, if you're in the conversation, stop doing anything else and just pay attention
   - SLANT method: sit up, lean forward, ask questions, nod your head, track the speaker.
   - Listen with your eyes. that's paying attention 100%
2. be a loud listener
   - listen so actively that you're burning calories (ex: Oprah Winfrey has highly reactive responses that relates to the emotions the speaker is describing)
   - metaphor of hospitality
     - listener: you're the host of a dinner party. you set the scene. you exude warmth towards your guests, showing how happy you are with them, drawing them closer to where they want to go
     - speaker: you're the guest at a dinner party. you bring gifts.
3. favor familiarity
   - "novelty penalty": people have trouble getting excited about the unfamiliar, but love to talk about what they know
   - talk about the movies they've seen or the game they watched
   - find the thing the other person is most attached to (a t-shirt of a kid's sports team, or someone with a nice motorcycle)
4. make them authors, not witnesses
   - people are not specific when they tell stories, they leave out concrete details. ask specific questions
   - don't just ask about what happened, ask **how they experienced** what happened
   - ask about experiences now vs experiences then (retrospecting), draw lessons people have learned and how they've changed
5. don't fear the pause
   - control your impatience and listen to learn, rather to respond.
   - pause to reflect consider how to respond to what's been said
   - Japanese culture encourages people to pause and reflect before replying. Japanese businesspeople are comfortable with 8-second pauses (2x Americans generally tolerate)
6. do the looping
   - looping = repeat what someone said to make sure you accurately received what they're trying to project
   - forces you to listen more carefully
   - keeps people focused on their core point, rather than drifting away on some tangent.
   - often times we are interpreting people incorrectly.
   - ex: if somebody says "My mother can be a real piece of work", say "So you're really pissed at your Mom?", and pause to see if they agree.
7. the midwife model
   - many good conversations are reciprocal (50/50 talk time), but some good conversations are by necessity lopsided.
   - ex: person A going through a hard time or facing a big life decision, and person B is there to accompany them in the process of deliberation
   - these conversations are an opportunity to listen to ourselves "sometimes we can't understand personal truths until we hear ourselves say them"
8. keep the gem statement at the center
   - gem statement = truth underneath the disagreement, something you both agree on
   - during conflicts, return to the gem statement to keep relationships between people strong.
9. find the disagreement under the disagreement
   - instead of trying to make other people see issues the way we do, ask why there's a disagreement in the first place,
     - what is the **values disagreement** underneath the practical disagreement?
   - look for moral, philosophical roots for why you each believe what you do -> mutual exploration -> pull stories out of each other
   - "Being curious about your friend's experience is more important than being right" – Lisa Feldman Barrett
10. don't be a topper
    - don't try to relate with your own experience, you're just shifting attention back to yourself
    - to build shared connection, sit with their experience

> The experience of being listened to all the way on something—until your meaning is completely clear to another human being—is extremely rare in life.

Some notes on C7: The Right questions.

- three questions for big picture
  - ultimate goals (What do you want to offer the world?)
  - your skills (What are you doing when you feel most alive?)
  - your schedule (How exactly do you fill your days?)
- an average child asks 40,000 questions between ages 2-5
- some point during late childhood or adolescence, we begin to withdraw from intimacy. society sends teh message we shouldn't show emotions, shouldn't get personal
- simple questions are best. David, as a journalist just asks the same question over and over again: "And then what happened?"
- broad, dumb questions > smart questions (meant to display how well-informed you are)
- questioning as a **moral practice**
  - asking a good question requires adopting a posture of humility
  - you're confessing you don't know and want to learn
  - you're also honoring a person, you admit you don't know what's going on in their mind
- the worst questions
  - questions that don't surrender power (which college, what neighborhood, what do you do?) -> implies "I'm about to judge you"
  - closed questions (instead of "were you close?" which limits to close/distant frame, ask "How is your mother?" so they can go as deep or as shallow when answering)
  - vague questions ("How's it going?", "What's up?") they're another way of saying "I'm greeting you, but I don't actually want you to answer."
- humble questions are open-ended
  - they encourage the other person to take control and take the conversation where they want it to go
  - they begin with "How did you...," "What's it like..." "Tell me about..." and "In what ways..."
- Good questions
  - "Where did you grow up?"
  - "That's a lovely name. How did your parents choose it?"
  - "What's the best way to grow old?"

Favorite questions to help people see life from a distance

- "What crossroads are you at?" At any moment, most of us are in
  the middle of some transition. The question helps people focus
  on theirs.
- "What would you do if you weren’t afraid?" Most people know
  that fear plays some role in their life, but they haven’t clearly
  defined how fear is holding them back.
- "If you died tonight, what would you regret not doing?"
- "If we meet a year from now, what will we be celebrating?"
- "If the next five years is a chapter in your life, what is that
  chapter about?"
- "Can you be yourself where you are and still fit in?"

Questions about the positive sides of life

- "Tell me about a time you adapted to change."
- "What's working really well in your life?"
- "What are you most self-confident about?"
- "Which of your five senses is strongest?"
- "Have you ever been solitary without feeling lonely?"
- "What has become clearer to you as you have aged?"

> Each person is a mystery. And when you are surrounded by mysteries, as the saying goes, it’s best to live life in the form of a question.
