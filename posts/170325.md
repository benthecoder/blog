i finally met everyone in person. vietnamese salad at Gott's Roadside is pretty good. UCSF medical campus is lovely, i admire the blue in mission bay conference center and the magnolias and pine trees in koret quad. spoke to B instead of standing at my poster most of the time. took caltrain down to san jose, it was an hour long ride. i called T while doing some work.

met up with B for dinner at capi sparta mexican kitchen. got crispy tacos that hurt my gums but i enjoyed the conversation.

checked into the hotel and felt alone at first, so i called T immediately. i'm wondering what the right balance is for solitude and togetherness. i don't want to develop an unhealthy attachment to her. but i know that every moment we share is precious-something i have to be grateful for. i need to apply the samem mindset more to the time i spend with my parents a well.
