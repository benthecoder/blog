the plan was to go to church, but woke up at 11:30 am. i watched the online recordings of ames church but couldn't really focus. felt disappointed in myself.

this was the day i was told my feature was too slow, so i had to switch it off and implement an improvement. luckily it wasn't a big change. it's something i should've anticipated while building out the feature, but it's good to make mistakes. i'm glad the feedback loop is tight at this company and that quality and excellence aren't nice-to-haves but necessary to keep this product the best app for doctors.

lately i've been binging the show fallout. it gets a bit gory in some scenes, but the story is interesting. i can definitely foresee a future where the rich are living underground, hiding in their safe houses while the poor are forced to stay above and descend into chaos.
