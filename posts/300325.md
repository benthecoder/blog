i went to my baptism/confirmation class at 11am for my joining the church as an associate member. there are three simple rules by john wesley to live out the baptism vows: do no harm, do good, and stay in love with God.

after church i spent 30 dollars buying roasted pork and fried rice and vege and pork buns. i felt scammed. i proceeded to buy air fryer liners, dish scrubes, and a sticky note for my interview. i went to A's house to start my prep. i'm beginning to lose my sanity. this interview has made me so jumpy and jittery all the time. i'm glad i have A to cowork with.

i left around 4:30 to buy groceries. i needed ginger for my chickens soup and vegetables. i got home, finished the ethics homework, and showered. the rest of the night was calling my family, talking to T, bearing the shouting lady beside my building, and doing bibile study with T. we watched bible project videos for [judges](https://bibleproject.com/guides/book-of-judges/) and [ruth](https://bibleproject.com/explore/video/ruth/). i slept at 12:13 am.
