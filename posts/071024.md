i had really bad migraine today again. where i just feel really nauseous and dizzy. i walk slower. i'm perpetually thirsty. i feel sick down to my bones. when i try to focus on something, i can feel my brain compressing. not really sure why this is happening. it's been like this since i readjusted my braces. it's probably that. i was told by my nurse it should be better this time though. hope this won't last for another 16.5 months.

my productivity and overall output is dramatically decreased. this is not ideal, especially during finals week. i'm only 22 about to turn 23. i shouldn't be this tired everyday, getting headaches and feeling sick often. there are old people in their 70s that have more energy than me. the elderly in church have more youthful energy. what can i do to feel better. maybe it's sleep. i need to get 8 hours. i've been getting 6 these days. time for bed. nothing is going into my brain today.
