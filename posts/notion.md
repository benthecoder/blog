I went to Notion HQ in SF today to listen to [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com/) speak.

I was all the way at the back, so couldn't really extract any insight out of his talk.

I'm a big fan of his side projects. He shared how he approaches building in his [blog](https://thesephist.com/posts/how-i-side-project/).

He also has a page called his [_stream_](https://stream.thesephist.com/), which is his mini twitter feed.

A summary of his advice

- ideas come from **personal needs**, solving an existing problem, or one that doesn't exist yet
- work on the idea when **motivation is highest**.
- Have templates and reusable frameworks to get started quickly. Use a **consistent set of tools**.
- **Share prototypes early**, embrace the rough MVP as a tipping point.
- Not every project reaches completion, **reflect on what went wrong** and apply the lessons to future ideas.
- Make projects **easy to iterate**, monitor, update, and restore.
- Push outside of your comfort zone
- Build things that **spark imagination** and open up new possibilities, not just demonstrate technical skills.
