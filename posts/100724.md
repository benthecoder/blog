- a great start to my day, wish all days could start this way
- climbing down the fire escape is so scary
- got to see M again in person after almost a year
- need to learn how to order and buy groceries in canto
- so hard to find rice
- finally found rice at Ming Lee trading
- I need a trader joe grocery bag
- how am i getting heartburn from walking fast
- had no choice but to eat a slice of pizza, i'm worried about the effects now
- prompt engineering challenge was pretty fun
- spell it to me, pronounce it
- the more people you know at networking events, the less you network, the less useful they are
- also feeling like they're not as useful if you haven't built anything yet
- exhausting day, probably the most tiring was doing combinatorics
- how to balance school and building and writing
- facing decision paralysis every single day
