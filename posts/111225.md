we toured 29 wyn apartments together. it was the only one available if i booked it a day before. i guess i should've planned more. i thought i was the only one finding apartments in this obscenely expensive housing market.

it was a self-guided tour, which meant i had to download two mobile apps, check in with the person at the desk, and the app would tell me which apartment units i had access to. getting in the elevator and opening the doors just meant i had to hold my phone close to the receiver. it took a while to process but overall it was cool.

the apartment was okay, definitely not worth the price. it had weird layouts like huge bathrooms, and the view wasn't great.

after that i went to the office and had lunch with T at icon mediterranean. i love their falafels.
