> "We have a deficit of wonder ... When I ask people questions now, they get on their computer: 'Gimme a few minutes and l’ll let you know.' And I’m, like, 'Nooooo!' I want them to wonder about it, man! I don’t want to know the answer. I just want them to wonder about it."

reflection:

- breeath in and out before you talk
- talk about context before you start, don't jump right in
- tell people why it matters
- relax, you’re not going to be fired, you're only 2 weeks in and you're doing a great job
- be confident in what you say, SOUND LIKE YOU OWN IT
- most people aren’t paying attention anyways, pretend you’re talking to just one person

tomorrow: understanding and moving slower

slept: 2:20 am
