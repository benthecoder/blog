> “The surest sign of wisdom is a constant cheerfulness,” - Michel de Montaigne

exam was quite short. 10 minutes as all it took. 6 to finish, 4 to check it 5 times. i probably made a mistake somewhere, but it's not important.

haven't been in campus for a while, it's nice to talk to friends. helps put things into perspective, about what you're doing, how you're feeling, and also reminds you to show curiosity and empathy for others.

doordash promo 5 bucks off for nick the greek is so value. beef/lamb gyro again. no yoghurt no cheese.

back to the gym with A. i find it effective to channel anger and fear by creating dramatic events in your head to gain more strength.

dinner with fam, meal courtesy of W. one of the last few nights i have with family in my house.

rearranged my bedroom again, stored more stuff in my luggages, gave a few hackathon and event freebies to fam. i don't want it to go back to before. wouldn't it be nice to have them be in california? to be able to walk my dad to the gym, and have my mom beside me while she asks me to eat before my food gets cold.

growing up is hard at times. i have to cherish the time and physical presence that i have with them the next few days. nothing else can matter more.
