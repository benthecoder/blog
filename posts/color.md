I was flipping through [The World According to Color](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693329-the-world-according-to-color) by [James Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD_CbJOPbnQ) in estlite in Tsim Sha Tsui, HK.

He traverses history, literature, art, and science to uncover behind the seven primary colors – black, red, yellow, blue, white, purple, and green – a root idea, based on visual resemblances and common symbolism throughout history.

Below are the artworks he featured in his book + some I added myself for each color for my own curation.

### Black

> In the apparent blackness of darkness we discerned our deepest fears;

![In the beginning there was darkness: in this remarkably modern image, the seventeenth-century cosmologist Robert Fludd depicted the primordial void as a simple black square](/images/void.jpeg)

![Sesshū’s Splashed-Ink Landscape, made in 1495. From one ink, variously diluted and masterfully applied, springs an evocative mountain scene: a wine tavern by a lake, complete with two boaters at the bottom right](/images/sesshu.jpg)

### Red

> in the glossy reds of blood we saw reflected our own lives and bodies;

![Le verre de porto (A Dinner Table at Night), 1884, John Singer Sargent](/images/dinnertable.jpeg)

### Yellow

> in the blinding yellow sun we glimpsed, through squinted eyes, our most powerful gods;

![In this Annunciation, by Fra Angelico in the 1420s, God is a golden sun, and his divine message a beam of light](/images/annunciation.jpg)

![Turner’s Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus is dominated by a vast and heroic sunset. The faint outlines of stallions carrying the sun over the horizon can just be made out](/images/polyphemus.jpg)

![In Regulus, Turner used chrome yellow and lead white to re-create the intense experience of staring directly into the sun. Contemporary critics advised viewers to keep a safe distance](/images/regulus.jpeg)

![The evanescent sunrise behind Norham Castle depends on a phenomenon called isoluminance. In black and white, we can see the sun’s yellow haze is exactly the same brightness as the blue sky around it](/images/norham.jpg)

### Blue

> and in cerulean skies and and seas we imagined worlds beyond our horizons.

![Wassily Kandinsky’s Improvisation 19 (also known as Blue Sound) is dominated by an exuberant blue haze that seems to transfigure the figures who pass through it](/images/bluesound.jpeg)

![Bacchus and Ariadne (1522–1523), Titian](/images/bacchus.jpg)

### White

> We championed clean white surfaces as paragons of visual, moral, and social purity

![Suprematist Composition: White on White (1918), Kazimir Malevich](/images/whiteonwhite.png)

![White Painting, 1951, Robert Rauschenberg](/images/whitepainting.jpeg)

### Purple

> celebrated the synthetic purples of the nineteenth century as beacons of technological progress

![Monet’s The Houses of Parliament, Seagulls is a pageant of purples](/images/parliament.jpeg)

![view of Waterloo Bridge, city’s industrial skyline smothered with synthetic purple emissions](/images/monetwaterloo.jpeg)

### Green

> and embraced the myriad greens of nature as emblems of paradise and renewal.

![The Green Interior (Figure Seated by a Curtained Window), 1891, Édouard Vuillard](/images/greeninterior.jpeg)

![Camille, 1866, Claude Monet](/images/greendress.jpeg)

![Still Life: Vase with Pink Roses, 1890, Vincent van Gogh](/images/stilllife.jpeg)

> We have projected these hopes, anxieties, and obsessions onto color for thousands of years. The history of color, therefore, is also a history of humanity.
