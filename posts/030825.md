from tamara on [dialectic](https://jacksondahl.com/dialectic/tamara-winter):

- writing helps you become more tuned to present moment if you're prone to daydreaming
- it helps you look for things to be grateful for

best writing has a few traits:

- clear
- has natural questions about the world
- does not overexplain or spell out the argument
