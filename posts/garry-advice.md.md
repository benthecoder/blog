Lessons and [advice](https://youtu.be/Y4yMc99fpfY?si=eWtfIxgEr7FcEz4F) by [Garry Tan](https://www.ycombinator.com/people/garry-tan), current CEO of [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/)

- **Get therapy** early to deal with childhood trauma, which manifests in unhealthy conflict behaviors: Garry grew up in poor Asian household, bought a big house and car and was spending a lot of money after getting his first job at Microsoft
- **Say yes** to compelling opportunities even if they seem risky: He declined Peter Thiel's offer to join Palantir early, losing out of hundreds of millions, but joined as employee #10 eventually
- **Good ideas seem dumb** at first, look for the intersection of ideas that seem good and ideas that are good: He and his friends at Stanford thought Google was dumb, but it's because it was unconventional.
- Learn from big tech jobs, but **leave before they make you soft**: he was working on a minor features in Microsoft that no one cared about, and rage quit to learn new things and build meaningful things
- **Make products**, don't just sell your time. Product equity can make money while you sleep: he worked as consultant for building websites, but also started building his own products ([Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous?useskin=vector) blogging platform) which created equity and value.
- 3 things founder needs: Excellent _co-founders_, solve real problems to get _customers_, and use that to raise _capital_ and grow.
- **Act small when you are small**: offer incredible 1:1 customer support and solve problems manually before scaling (related [Do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html))
- There are **too many problems**, not too few ideas, believe in your ability to solve problems with [technology](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/): climate change, disease, poverty, lack of education, etc.
