- a kitchen strainer = colander
- $16 poke + free boba at V Cafe
- lots of dentists around, i need a dentist, braces cost 5k USD, the financial stress is real
- walked past my campus downtown building 3 times
- classes is pretty fun because there's interesting python exercises to test my skills but i could do all these for free online, so what am i paying for hmm, for accountability? because i lack the willpower and motivation to do these myself?
- i spent the entire time in class speedrunning the labs and homework, and for the rest of the day, i don't know how to stop, this is a big flaw, opportunity cost. i'm pre-optimizing life
- acme bread is currently my fav bakery
- there should be an app linking all SF chinatown grocery stores, why are there so many of them? if there is one that is cheapest why do people still go to the others? better quality?
- regretting not talking to a single new person in class
- goal is to say hi to someone tomorrow. paying tuition and going to classes is not even worth it if i'm not making friends
- i need money i need money i need money i need money i need money i need money i need money
- still not shipping, hard to balance between
  - classes + projects + practicum (later) + quizzes
  - cooking
  - gym
  - shipping
  - going events
  - other work (writing, hp, etc)
- my brain never stops
- also can't feel like i can ever relax, which is bad, i need people in my life to remind me to slow down, do things that are not goal/achievement oriented
- sundays will be my rest days
