I experienced my first Voleyball game at Ponderosa Park in Sunnyvale today.

"Can you bump, set, and spike?" I was asked.

I played with pretty good players, and it was intimidating and I felt the pressure to perform well.

Every error I made, made me want to quit more.

It can actually be fun if I had the fundamentals better. Knowing how to serve, set, and hit over the net will make it more enjoyable, and make me a better teammate.

Some interesting [rules](https://www.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com/basic-volleyball-rules-and-terminology/) I learned

- 6 players each
- The six positions are setter, middle blocker, outside hitter, opposite hitter, libero and serving specialist.
- maximum of three hits per side
- typically three or five sets
- Three-set matches are two sets to 25 points and a third set to 15 points
- A ball hitting a boundary line is in
