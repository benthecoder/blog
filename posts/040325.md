> A writer, I think, is someone who pays attention to the world. That means trying to understand, take in, connect with, what wickedness human beings are capable of; and not be corrupted—made cynical, superficial—by this understanding. – Susan Sontag

it's the last class of the semester. we went to sfusd to distribute 500 of her flyers. i'm so happy seeing her work being shared across SF. went to la promenade after to get some studying done. napped in bus with ghibli music. ate at Kim Sơn Restaurant, got the no 7. pho. i took an hour to finish time series homework and started having headaches again.

started advml studying, discussed hackathon, t shirt designing has begun. just shy of 10 days before the actual hackathon. i got canva free trial and T generously decided to help us again.

starting to get worried about job applications again. i hate mass applying. how do i get connected with the right people?
