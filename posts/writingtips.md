Ryan shares three [writing tactics](https://www.developing.dev/p/writing-tactics-part-1) that help you be more effective at work

1. Make the first line interesting
   - show them why they should care immediately.
   - you have to know your audience well to do this.
   - examples
     - (Sharing launch results): share the metric movements that the audience cares about.
     - (Asking for collaboration): highlight the expected outcomes from the work that are most important to the audience.
     - (Raising awareness for a problem): explain the severity of the problem in a way the audience understands.
2. make your ask clear
   - either share it **first thing**
   - or **at the end** after providing the relevant context for them to understand your ask
   - Before:
     > Service X is broken. I think it's because of the push. Could you help me revert a diff？ This change went out at Y time and I can see a clear drop in the success rate just after that. I'm not sure though still and want a second opinion
   - After:
     > Prod is down, can you help me revert a diff？
     >
     > Service X is broken. I think it's because of the push. This change went out at Y time and I can see a clear drop in the success rate just after that. I'm not sure though still and want a second opinion
3. write simply
   - the more simply the writing, the more your idea will get through to the audience
   - if you can remove a word and preserve the meaning, do it
   - if you can replace a complex word with a simple one, do it

these were for short writing, he shared more [tactics](https://www.developing.dev/p/writing-tactics-part-2) for longer writing, i.e. planning docs, announcements, design docs, and more.

The main ideas are to include a tl;dr and format the writing to optimize for skimming (people skim in an [F-shaped pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered))

- add a tl;dr: put what your audience must know in a few lines, the most important takeaways
- add a table of contents: for longer posts, let people jump to what they care about
- add section headings: gives people a sense of how relevant a section is
- use bullets and lists: much easier to skim than paragraphs, the spacing separates ideas clearly, delivering the key points to readers
- bold the main points: draw attention to what matters most, use your judgement and use appropriately
- break up long paragraphs: add line breaks where it makes sense, don't let paragraphs get too long

Lastly, you get better at writing by doing and asking for feedback by from people who write well.

Write, reflect on feedback, iterate.
