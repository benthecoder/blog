Dubbed the “Best noodles in China”, the Lanzhou beef noodles were first created by a cook named Ma Liuqi, a native of Dongxiang ethnic group, under the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1875 - 1908) in the Qing Dynasty (1616 - 1911).

They have since become an internationally renowned Chinese-style fast food.

The dish has five main features: clear soup, white radish, red pepper, green caraway and yellow noodles.

Ox 9 Lanzhou HandPulled Noodles serves this.

Why Ox 9? A common Chinese phrase known as 'Nine Cows Can't Pull Back" is often used to describe their persistent attitude toward an obstacle.

This phrase was commonly used to describe the founder, David.

It is precisely because of his obsession with tradition and authenticity that David specially shipped the main ingredients and spices from Lanzhou.

From the ingredients to the techniques, they all follow the traditional Lanzhou beef noodle production process.

It took more than 6 months of hard work with his team and over 30 recipe trials till David successfully mastered his recipe.
